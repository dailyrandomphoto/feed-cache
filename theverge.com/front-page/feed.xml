    <title>Disney unveils Star, its Hulu replacement for international Disney Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3KHGidpv5oRc1jzOlJ5mO2ZXvQ=/72x0:975x602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493583/atlanta.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSWFVO"&gt;Star, Disney’s international answer to Hulu, will roll out in certain European countries, Canada, and New Zealand beginning on February 23rd, the company announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9IYqm"&gt;Star is a free tier within Disney Plus for subscribers in Europe, Canada, and New Zealand will be fully integrated into Disney Plus. It will be accessible as the sixth brand tile in the app. Essentially, this will carry a number of shows from Disney’s other non-main franchise brands. That means shows from FX and movies from 20th Century will be available to stream. People will be able to opt-in to choose they want to watch shows with higher ratings. Disney also plans to announce Star Plus. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will update when information is available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLRtxf"&gt;Disney CEO Bob Chapek first talked about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354712/disney-star-streaming-service-international-expansion-hulu-plus-abc-fx-fox"&gt;Star in early August&lt;/a&gt;, announcing plans to launch an international streaming service that would effectively become a more general entertainment platform similar to Hulu. Unlike Hulu, Star won’t carry titles from other studios. Instead, Hulu will only carry TV shows and films from ABC, FX, Freeform, Searchlight, and 20th Century Studios. The streamer will also have localized content for various countries it operates in. Chapek believes that adding Star will “enable us to grow our business even further in the years ahead.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZXlvJ"&gt;“In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror our successful Disney Plus strategy by using our Disney Plus technical platform, bringing in content we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own, which is, of course, Star,” Chapek told analysts at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YpwgzO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Absent from Chapek’s announcement was details about what is happening with Hulu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SqOJmr"&gt;Disney Stars Studio is a big brand overseas. When Disney acquired Indian conglomerate Star India and its subsequent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;streaming service HotStar in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the company rebranded the streamer to Disney Plus HotStar. Now, Star is known as Disney’s Star India. Having “Star” become the international brand name, on top of Disney Plus, makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j21FS"&gt;Absent from Chapek’s announcement was details about what is happening with Hulu. Prior to Chapek announcing Star in August, the plan was to bring Hulu to international markets. That was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21123168/hulu-international-2021-disney-plus-streaming-bundle-rollout"&gt;case up until February 2020&lt;/a&gt; under former CEO Bob Iger. If Hulu remains a domestic only streaming service, it can only amass so many subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4P123"&gt;Chapek pointed out in August that “Hulu has no brand awareness outside of the US.” But is Hulu still a priority for Disney? The company is facing a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/media/disney-hulu-comcast.html"&gt;multi-billion dollar payout&lt;/a&gt; to Comcast in 2024 and, while Disney is seeing “very, very strong demand for advertising on Hulu,” according to chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, Hulu’s place in the overall Disney streaming empire is a bit of a conundrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avAXiD"&gt;Since former CEO Randy Freer stepped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117502/hulu-ceo-randy-freer-disney-plus-kevin-mayer-dtc-espn-marvel-studios#:~:text=Randy%20Freer%20is%20stepping%20down,business%20under%20its%20own%20executives."&gt;down at the end of January&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Hulu executives have left the company. Disney executives have been brought in to see the service. Now, Hulu will be overseen in part by Kareem Daniel, who heads up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514728/disney-streaming-reorganization-plus-espn-hulu-studios-movies-network-tv-shows-pandemic"&gt;Disney’s new Media and Entertainment division&lt;/a&gt; and is in charge of all things streaming. Chapek and Daniel made it clear this afternoon that Star is a big part of Disney’s future — whether or not Hulu is remains unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKkU41"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus will add 50 new Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar series and movies ‘over the next few years’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqUgqL5xi5xfkI_Gkh8nmi9KfkA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493553/acastro_190411_1777_Disney_Streaming_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="paX4aO"&gt;Disney has announced that it will bring a lot of original content directly to its Disney Plus streaming service over the next few years. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Disney/status/1337152322653351936"&gt;is bringing&lt;/a&gt; “roughly” 10 Marvel series, 10 Star Wars series, 15 Disney live-action, Disney Animation, and Pixar series, and 15 all-new Disney live-action, Disney Animation and Pixar features to Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2HUhU"&gt;The commitment to launch so many shows directly on Disney Plus speaks to Disney’s confidence in the service in the long-term. The company dipped its toes in launching directly on Disney Plus with the premiere of the live-action remake of &lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, and Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; is set to premiere on the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;on December 25th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzNPuE"&gt;Disney Plus launched just over a year ago, and it already has more than 86 million subscribers, a figure the company also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. That growth has been in part fueled by the success of the mega-hit &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, a series airing only on Disney Plus that is currently in its second season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney to release Raya and the Last Dragon on Disney Plus and in theaters on the same day </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4IPsC5-X4udmfIgRYNVtganO8IQ=/86x0:1484x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493513/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_4.50.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cq8599"&gt;Disney will release &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;as a Premier Access title the same day it hits theaters on March 5th, 2021, the company announced today. Disney did not provide a price for the movie, but when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21407106/disney-mulan-release-date-free-streaming-subscribers-december-window"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;shifted to Premier Access&lt;/a&gt;, it charged $30 for the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKdZqv"&gt;Similar to WarnerMedia, Disney needs to have a continuous stream of new releases to keep people subscribed for $7 a month and bring in new subscribers. Also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;like WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt;, most of the movies that Disney is moving to Disney Plus, bypassing a theatrical release, were box office gambles to being with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pe6pQc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome to the Kingdom of Kumandra. Raya and the Last Dragon is coming to theaters and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; with Premier Access on March 5, 2021. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyRaya?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyRaya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tF94qRTo0E"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tF94qRTo0E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney (@Disney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Disney/status/1337152641135239169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vnk6El"&gt;Before Disney Plus, Disney had no choice but to bring them to theaters or release them as straight-to-video titles, which wasn’t a great option. Now, those movies can be used to bolster Disney Plus and give subscribers something new to watch. CEO Bob Chapek said Disney saw enough of a performance to justify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;continuing the release strategy&lt;/a&gt; and plans to release more films in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIiohB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBJ2d3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus hits 86 million subscribers in a little over one year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iMbwmx3LsqcoPn0bjFoFqt1QBp8=/93x0:648x370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493362/baby_yoda.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MfE15d"&gt;Disney Plus has amassed more than 86 million subscribers since launching in November 2019, CEO Bob Chapek announced. Disney also announced that Hulu has reached 38.8 million subscribers and ESPN Plus has amassed 11.5 million subscribers. Disney’s streaming services now have a combined total of 137 million subscribers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rM2r8D"&gt;“Disney Plus has exceeded our expectations,” Chapek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4lpK0"&gt;Disney Plus’ latest batch of subscribers came amid its expansion into parts of Latin America in late November. Just before the rollout, Chapek announced that Disney Plus had amassed just under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;75 million subscribers globally&lt;/a&gt;. With its new milestone, Disney has accomplished in one year more than executives originally hoped to accomplish by 2024. To put it another way, Disney accomplished in one year what Netflix took several years to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eGqiF"&gt;Prioritizing streaming as a core part of Disney’s business is paying off for the House of Mouse. Executives have made moves over the course of the last 10 months that seem to have cemented their faith in Disney Plus: &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;moved from a theatrical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;title to Disney Plus for free&lt;/a&gt; (alongside &lt;em&gt;Artemis Fowl &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;Pixar’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;kicked off Disney’s Premier Access program, which charges an additional fee for new films, and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian’&lt;/em&gt;s second season&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;leaped into some of the most-watched programming in the United States, according to Nielsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KP88Jb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To put it another way, Disney accomplished in one year what Netflix took several years to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UnPr4O"&gt;Major shareholders like Dan Loeb are publicly asking Disney to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/dan-loeb-calls-on-disney-to-suspend-dividend-invest-it-in-disney-plus.html"&gt;go in even more on streaming&lt;/a&gt;, and Disney is listening. The company is planning to forgo its semiannual dividend payout to shareholders to invest in more content for its streaming platforms, most meaningfully Disney Plus. As Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris wrote in a note prior to Disney’s fourth quarter earnings in November, the company is making “streaming its primary mechanism for monetization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ECwOb"&gt;2021 is shaping up to be a good year for Disney Plus. More live-action adaptations, like &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio, &lt;/em&gt;are &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/disney-plus-moving-pinocchio-cruella-peter-pan-and-wendy-no-theaters-1234619134/"&gt;reportedly heading&lt;/a&gt; to Disney Plus, Marvel Studios’ series will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562411/wandavision-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;finally start premiering&lt;/a&gt;, and there will likely be new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; things to look forward to. On top of potential new series from Pixar and Disney’s own live-action divisions, Disney is going to want to add as much to its service as possible — especially as WarnerMedia prepares to bring Warner Bros.’ entire slate to HBO Max and compete for people’s wallets and attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RGLoL"&gt;Disney Plus is still expanding, and it’s still got a long way to go. Netflix likely has more than 200 million subscribers worldwide at this point. But more than 86 subscribers in just a little over a year is pretty impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mJTMmm"&gt;
&lt;aside id="tpKGOc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus","description":"$6.99 per month or $69.99 if you pay annually","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will let parents block kids from playing Xbox until their homework is done</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5WGZXu5XYYyo0Zd45edqO0qhQY0=/0x34:911x641/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493291/Family_Settings_App_Hero_Img_12_9_updated.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="66qb6I"&gt;Microsoft is adding &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/xbox-family-settings-app-updates/"&gt;new screen time and game purchasing controls&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox Family Settings app in anticipation of a gaming-filled holiday at home. Microsoft originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271922/xbox-family-settings-app-screen-time-limits-windows-10"&gt;launched the app in preview&lt;/a&gt; during the summer, and it released the final version in September. But the company is now adding in more features so parents can better manage their children's playtime on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvgsOS"&gt;Alongside the current ability to set and manage the amount of time kids are able to play on their Xbox, parents can now also use Pause Screen Time to temporarily block an account as motivation to finish homework or hang out with family members. The block can be removed any time via the app or automatically turned off at the end of the day. If the blocked account tries to play anything while the block is on, they’ll be shown a notification informing them their screen time is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U3cq8"&gt;Microsoft is also adding in some controls over purchases that were previously available directly on Xboxes and PCs. With the “Ask to Buy” setting turned on in the Xbox Family Settings app, when a kid goes to buy something from the Xbox Marketplace, their parent will be notified in the app from which they can read more about the game and approve the purchase. With the setting turned on for an account, only purchases made with a gift card or the remaining account balance will go through without approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1WJZp"&gt;The Xbox Family Settings app is available for download now on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxfamily&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xbox-family-settings/id1507406707"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2020 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2020 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2020 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2020. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2020 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 touchscreen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Un0RYw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air is the best laptop you can buy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;The 2-in-1 laptop to buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best Windows clamshell you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 is another great convertible laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGYHSb"&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21022770/hp-spectre-x360-13-2019-laptop-2-in-1-convertible-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 13 (late 2019)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ff7WtW"&gt;A gorgeous 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BGSdq5"&gt;The Spectre x360 is a premium-level 2-in-1 Windows laptop with the latest processor options from Intel, a vibrant touchscreen, and more port options than are found on other laptops in this segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL9pqG"&gt;The x360 weighs less than three pounds and is about two-thirds of an inch thick when closed, which makes it very easy to travel with. The latest model has a smaller footprint than before, thanks to shrunken bezels above and below the screen, but it still maintains a full-size keyboard and spacious trackpad. In addition, it provides both facial and fingerprint biometric authentication, so you can choose which way you prefer to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQyU1"&gt;HP updated the trackpad drivers it uses in the latest model to Microsoft’s Precision set and the experience is improved over the older versions to the point where it’s no longer an issue. The x360’s trackpad is now right up there with the best Windows trackpad options (which are still a tick behind what you get on a MacBook) in terms of scrolling, multifinger gestures, and palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msO0V8"&gt;The biggest argument against the x360 is that it has a 16:9 display, as opposed to the 16:10 or 3:2 screens you’ll find on Dell or Microsoft’s computers. Those taller aspect ratios are much better for productivity work, whether that’s working in two documents side by side or researching on the web without having to scroll as much. But unless you are very particular about your screen’s aspect ratio, most people won’t find this to be a deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="04pBWK"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 15 is one of the best laptops for video editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telaZa"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE proves that you don’t need to break the bank for a great gaming experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xLW8VK"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds option to limit alcohol or gambling advertisements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTTdzzMiy9M4grV9nbHoT3UHrXs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493144/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9tkIH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ads/greater-controls-sensitive-ad-topics-your-ad-settings/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FATHs+%28Google+Ads+%26+Commerce+Blog%29"&gt;Google has announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s rolling out the ability for users to limit how many alcohol and gambling ads they’re shown (&lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-youtube-add-user-controls-to-limit-alcohol-gambling-ads-344611"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Search Engine Land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This should be a welcome feature for users who may be sensitive to seeing alcohol use or gambling, or are looking to avoid those topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mpz5dR"&gt;While Google has previously allowed users to hide specific ads, this change affects ads category-wide. It’s also already had restrictions on the categories based on age and national laws — the change just lets users apply those limits to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TptFG"&gt;The settings for the two categories are separate, so if you’re fine with gambling ads but not alcohol ads, or vice versa, you can allow one but not the other. It’s worth noting that the feature only promises to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reduce the number of alcohol and gambling ads you’ll see, not eliminate them completely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Picture showing the categories with buttons that say “See fewer”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XS2uDZPf32XixEtFe6xcuhvK5ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160860/Lubac_image.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The limits will only affect YouTube for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6PIss6"&gt;Google says that “[t]his feature will roll out in Ad Settings gradually, beginning with YouTube Ads in the US, and we aim to introduce this for Google Ads and YouTube globally in early 2021.” If you want to turn off either category, you can go to your &lt;a href="https://adssettings.google.com/"&gt;Ad Settings page&lt;/a&gt;. If the change has rolled out to your account, the buttons will be located at the bottom of the page. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 devs warn streamers to turn off all music to avoid DMCA strikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7WFlGA9Noimu7dFmoHyg5JHeIo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493084/Cyberpunk_2077_screen_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UmCgQg"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s (CDPR) highly anticipated new roleplaying game &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;is having a bit of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia#comments"&gt;rough release&lt;/a&gt;, and now you can add potential copyright issues while streaming to its list of launch-day hiccups. The developer says until it has a fix ready, any potential Twitch streamers should turn off all in-game music to avoid any strikes on their channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulioDf"&gt;The developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1336788550247976962"&gt;first warned potential streamers on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; officially launched in all regions, that a certain song (CDPR didn’t say which one) during the game’s “Braindance” sequences might trigger a Digital Millennium Copyright Act strike. That’s even if you’re using the &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/36734/dedicated-cyberpunk-2077-feature-for-content-creators-disable-copyrighted-music"&gt;specific in-game setting&lt;/a&gt; designed to toggle off copyrighted music for this exact reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCNz3s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It has come to our attention that there are additional instances in the game which might put a DMCA strike on your channel. Fix is on the way but until then, we'd like to ask you to mute music in the game's settings entirely. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SS0yhyPrMo"&gt;https://t.co/SS0yhyPrMo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1337125150668558342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oScv9O"&gt;Braindance is a kind of memory replay in the world of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;It appears the two sequences you play through as part of the main story feature both a copyrighted song and also some kind of bug that prevents that song from getting toggled off with the in-game setting option. CDPR advised simply turning sound off during the Braindance portions of the game to avoid receiving a DMCA strike on your channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqymsw"&gt;But now CDPR says that the issue may be larger than it first realized, and it’s now advising streamers turn off in-game music entirely due to “additional instances in the game which might put a DMCA strike on your channel.” CDPR says a fix is on the way, but it’s not an ideal situation to have to disable all music (both copyrighted and original tracks) when streaming the game just to avoid tripping the automated detection systems that protect copyrighted works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6jZO9"&gt;Hopefully the developer releases a patch soon to remedy the issue because without it, any Twitch streams of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;are going to be awfully quiet for the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hdmTNd"&gt;Visa and Mastercard will stop processing payments on Pornhub following &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; that found unlawful content on the site. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pornhub-mastercard/mastercard-to-stop-processing-payments-on-pornhub-cites-unlawful-content-idUSKBN28K30C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Mastercard will end support for Pornhub after confirming the presence of “unlawful content.” Visa said its own investigation is ongoing, but that it will suspend payment processing for the time being. The decisions come as Pornhub is making substantial changes to how it moderates content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeN7s1"&gt;“Today, the use of our cards at Pornhub is being terminated. Our investigation over the past several days has confirmed violations of our standards prohibiting unlawful content on their site,” Mastercard spokesperson Seth Eisen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result, and in accordance with our policies, we instructed the financial institutions that connect the site to our network to terminate acceptance. In addition, we continue to investigate potential illegal content on other websites to take the appropriate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D7UsuG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Given the allegations of illegal activity, Visa is suspending Pornhub’s acceptance privileges pending the completion of our ongoing investigation.

&lt;p id="gZFXTG"&gt;Pornhub came under fire after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; finding nonconsensual pornography, recordings of assault, and videos of underage girls on the site. The company called claims that it allows child sexual abuse material “irresponsible and flagrantly untrue.” Soon after, however, Pornhub &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164031/pornhub-upload-limit-blocked-download-nyt-kristof-child-abuse"&gt;banned uploads&lt;/a&gt; by unidentified users and blocked downloading videos from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlLsb3"&gt;Payment processing giants Visa and Mastercard confirmed earlier this week that they were conducting independent investigations of Pornhub content. “When we identify illegal activity, our policy is to ask the acquirer to terminate the relationship, unless an effective compliance plan is put in place,” Mastercard &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/visa-mastercard-pornhub.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Visa said that it was “actively engaging with the relevant financial institutions,” as well as Pornhub’s parent company MindGeek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOnODZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 10th, 4:49PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visa has now suspended Pornhub, too. This story has been updated to reflect the announcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cydia sues Apple alleging its App Store has a monopoly</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUF9BT"&gt;A new lawsuit from the creator of jailbroken iOS app store Cydia claims Apple used anti-competitive tactics that froze out Cydia and other would-be rivals when it created its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM9vdW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160777/cydia_sues_apple.pdf"&gt;Apple, the lawsuit states&lt;/a&gt;, “began coercing users to utilize no other iOS app distribution service but the App Store, coupling it closer and closer to the iPhone itself in order to crowd out all competition.” The company is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages: “This lawsuit seeks to open the markets for iOS app distribution and iOS app payment processing to those who wish to compete fairly with Apple, and to recover the enormous damages Apple caused.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jjFL8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saurik"&gt;Software developer Jay Freeman&lt;/a&gt; launched Cydia in 2007, before Apple had established the App Store. After the launch of the App Store, Cydia became a way for users to install apps, tweaks, and software that hadn’t been approved by Apple. The lawsuit alleges that the early iPhones were limited in functionality and came with “only a handful of Apple apps,” and they were not able to install third-party software or additional apps. Over the years, Apple made it more difficult to jailbreak iPhones and, the lawsuit alleges, discouraged developers from using non-Apple app stores. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18143422/cydia-disables-in-app-purchases-ios-jailbreak-store-apple-iphone"&gt;Cydia shut down new purchases&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vsg5T"&gt;Cydia’s lawsuit, first &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/cydia-apple-lawsuit/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, claims that Apple now has a monopoly over iOS software distribution. “Were it not for Apple’s anticompetitive acquisition and maintenance of an illegal monopoly over iOS app distribution, users today would actually be able to choose how and where to locate and obtain iOS apps, and developers would be able to use the iOS app distributor of their choice,” according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wofQOR"&gt;Apple says it plans to review the lawsuit and continues to discourage people from jailbreaking iPhones for security reasons. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Finternetsecurity-mobile-android-vs-ios-which-is-more-secure.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167964%2Fcydia-sues-apple-monopoly-anticompetitive-iphone#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 study from antivirus company Norton&lt;/a&gt; found that Apple’s stringent controls over what apps are allowed into the App Store made iOS devices somewhat more secure than those running the more popular &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/"&gt;open-source Android&lt;/a&gt; operating system. However, the US Copyright Office has established that iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/jailbreaking-not-crime-tell-copyright-office-free-your-devices"&gt;jailbreaking is not illegal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5mD8q"&gt;Cydia is the latest company to allege Apple has engaged in anti-competitive behavior. In August, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;introduced a new direct payment system&lt;/a&gt; in its popular &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to bypass Apple’s 30 percent fee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off&lt;/a&gt; the App Store for violating its rules, and Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;responded with a civil lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Apple, alleging that the iPhone maker was violating antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHsLb9"&gt;A judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21492334/epic-fortnite-apple-lawsuit-restraining-order-unreal-engine"&gt;granted an injunction&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Apple from retaliating against Epic’s Unreal Engine platform, but refused to grant an injunction that would have restored &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in Apple’s App Store. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427779/apple-epic-games-breach-of-contract-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store"&gt;said it would seek damages&lt;/a&gt; against Epic for allegedly breaching its contract with the iOS App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHSB18"&gt;In September, several companies that have criticized Apple — including Epic, Spotify, Basecamp, Match Group, Tile, Blix, and Deezer — created the &lt;a href="https://appfairness.org/"&gt;Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/a&gt; to “create a level playing field for app businesses and give people freedom of choice on their devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFASqY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
