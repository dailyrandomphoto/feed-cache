    <title>Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is down to $100 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Duo can charge a Qi-equipped iPhone alongside an Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Kfo3E"&gt;Another week, another round of deals worthy of your consideration to save your hard-earned money. Last week, we saw Apple’s MagSafe Battery pack fall to a new all-time low, and now its premium dual-wireless charger is following suit, with more deals in tow if you read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKVuVq"&gt;While the iPhone’s MagSafe charging ecosystem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;remains a bit of a mess&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been with us long enough to see sizable discounts hitting its upper crust of accessories. The MagSafe Duo charger may not be everyone’s favorite — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, we flagged some quibbles we had with its design and asking price — but it remains one of the fastest ways to wirelessly charge an iPhone and Apple Watch from a single source. It also folds up for easy travel and storage. At a new low price of $100 ($29 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nEXnt5Mz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, it’s definitely worth considering. Just be sure to budget for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C power adapter&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t already have one, as the MagSafe Duo does not include it and you’ll need at least a 20W model to fast-charge your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RVSQM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oRocMb"&gt;On the topic of tech we can appreciate a little more once the price drops, the Fitbit Charge 5 is still $50 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nl8R6oaf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The Charge 5 is the latest model of Fitbit’s popular line of fitness trackers, however, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Jay Peters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;felt that the wearable’s reliance on a touchscreen really hampered the experience&lt;/a&gt;. The shortcomings of the Charge 5 are easier to overlook now that it costs 28 percent less, especially since it packs a bright, color screen and stress management features. The $130 price point matches the Charge 5 price we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so you are getting the best price around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JwJ89n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fitbit is rolling out an ECG app to the Charge 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22765408/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-electrocardiogram-app-daily-readiness-score"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RwOBpw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DyUvyC"&gt;Shifting over to a different kind of wearable, one that’s also helpful for your fitness routine, the Bose Sport Open earbuds are $30 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VRLZGMF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nDQEkc7Z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. These are some unique earbuds from Bose, offering an open design that helps keep you aware of what’s around you. Our own Dieter Bohn tested these Bose, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22330833/open-ear-headphones-review-best-bike-riding" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;alongside several other open-design listening options&lt;/a&gt;, and found them to have very good sound quality, though they may not be ideal if you wear eyeglasses while you run or bike, as the earbuds’ hook may get in the way. Still, for just $169, you can have great sound while maintaining a high level of situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wv7h2D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905045"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLjDFE"&gt;If you’re in the market for a future-proof tablet, the current discount on the 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor and 512GB of storage offers a lot of headroom for an excellent value. This configuration of iPad Pro can be had from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931YYPNN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $979&lt;/a&gt;, a discount of $120. The M1 chip ensures that this iPad Pro will stay quick and snappy years into the future, and with four times the amount of storage as the base model, you can be a little less reliant on iCloud and other cloud-based storage solutions. The iPad Pro also sports Apple’s new Center Stage feature, which allows the front-facing camera to automatically track you during video calls. Just add a keyboard and you have yourself a serviceable laptop alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nlRX0x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brydge’s 11-inch Max Plus iPad keyboard is now available","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759698/brydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="SXHsJw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905041"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ndq1JX"&gt;Some more deals on tech, accessories, and gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0vVmvx"&gt;Twelve months of Xbox Live Gold is just &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal120621&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft-12-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832011522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SSAZZ624&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be a cost-effective way to get into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, if you’re not already subscribed. Add it to your account, buy one month of Game Pass, and the 12 months of Xbox Live will be converted. If you already have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, this can extend your membership by an additional four months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nD8nEH"&gt;Apple’s official Leather Case with MagSafe for the iPhone 12 Mini is just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24 in black at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the usual $59. That is a great value if you have the diminutive-sized iPhone from last year and want some premium leather without the premium cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NAt4eI"&gt;The Acer Nitro XF273 IPS 1080p monitor is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nZrJOpoF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$210 ($90 off) at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now. It may not be the highest resolution for a monitor of this size, but the 27-inch display offers a fast response rate and up to 165Hz refresh for a low cost. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2ap1uk"&gt;The Beats Flex are $20 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nHQVA7QG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to $50. Sadly, this used to be the full price of the Flex earbuds, before Apple increased the price to $70 in September. That said, they are still very worthwhile neckbuds at $50. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VEdc1H"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY86472?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; versions of the 8BitDo Pro 2 Bluetooth controller for the Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$5 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the coupon. That brings this excellent controller down to $45, matching its historical low price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7i3YJT"&gt;Apple’s base model Mac Mini with the M1 processor is down to just &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$570 at Costco&lt;/a&gt;. This member-exclusive price is on the 256GB model, the cheapest option for the tiny Mac that punches well above its weight class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty workers are walking out to protest layoffs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzmFEBER0HQRFRb3DjDRZmozEnM=/17x0:1619x1068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235548/WZ_OP_FLASHBACK_002.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyfaRn"&gt;Staff at Raven Software, known for its work on the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise, are walking out in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;layoffs of a dozen QA employees on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, as reported by outlets including &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/activision-s-call-of-duty-warzone-qa-team-to-strike-at-raven-software"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-warzone-devs-stage-walkout-over-layoffs-1848165716"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22820273/raven-software-layoffs-walk-out-protest-activision"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Workers are demanding &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRR7-VsS2r-DPqkAgEiAqYwSSlAqC0hc4Se5pjd2c13qJUKkrD4AKTwFgx4IOrrV84aADHW7c6HM7pc/pub"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “every member of the QA team, including those terminated on Friday, must be offered full time positions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPgq2m"&gt;The individuals informed that their contracts would end on January 28th were in “good standing,” the statement says, and many who weren’t laid off are “still unsure about the status of their employment.” The statement also underscores the QA team’s importance to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, Activision’s hugely popular battle royale shooter, which the workers say earns an astounding $5.2 million &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;. “Terminating the contracts of high performing testers in a time of consistent work and profit puts the health of the studio at risk,” the statement says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w92Nq0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today Raven QA, as a department, is demonstrating in protest of the layoffs on Friday. Raven QA's team is essential to the studio's day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;— ABetterABK   ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1467880080919732227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XeygH"&gt;An Activision Blizzard spokesperson confirmed it has notified 20 “temporary workers” across its studios that their contracts won’t be extended. It’s unclear which other studios were affected, and the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7JlUj"&gt;Activision Blizzard has been under intense scrutiny following the state of California’s lawsuit against the company alleging it fostered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;a culture of “constant sexual harassment.”&lt;/a&gt; That scrutiny has only increased following a bombshell &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;has been aware&lt;/a&gt; of sexual misconduct allegations at the company for years &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has had his own history of abusive behavior. Employees walked out in protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;following the lawsuit in July&lt;/a&gt; and again after &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; report in November. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s latest security feature is designed to protect itself from buggy code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sY1RIxIX2UN6QRT--CO_yky48dk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235336/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oSzZdP"&gt;Firefox 95, the latest version of Mozilla’s browser that’s rolling out starting today, introduces a new security feature that’s designed to limit the damage that bugs and security vulnerabilities in its code can cause, &lt;a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/12/webassembly-and-back-again-fine-grained-sandboxing-in-firefox-95/"&gt;Mozilla announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, called &lt;a href="https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/"&gt;RLBox&lt;/a&gt;, was developed with help from researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas, and it was originally released &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-for-mac-and-linux-to-get-a-new-security-sandbox-system/"&gt;as a prototype last year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s coming to both the desktop and mobile versions of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYa4Yt"&gt;At its core, RLBox is a sandboxing technology, which means that it’s effectively able to isolate code so that any security vulnerabilities it might contain can’t harm the overall system. Sandboxing is a widely used security method across the industry, and browsers already run web content in sandboxed processes to try to stop malicious or buggy sites from compromising the overall browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXouSa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mozilla hopes other programs and browsers adopt the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWksHB"&gt;RLBox differs from this traditional approach, however, and doesn’t have the same costs to performance and memory usage. This makes it possible to sandbox critical browser subcomponents like its spell checker, effectively allowing it to treat them as untrusted code while still running in the same process. This places limits on how code can run or which memory it can access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jB0PO3"&gt;As of today’s release, Firefox is isolating five modules: its Graphite font rendering engine, Hunspell spell checker, Ogg multimedia container format, Expat XML parser, and Woff2 web font compression format. Mozilla says this means if bugs or vulnerabilities are discovered in one of these subcomponents, the Firefox team won’t need to scramble to stop them from compromising the entire browser. “Even a zero-day vulnerability in any of them should pose no threat to Firefox,” Mozilla says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYrnQy"&gt;Mozilla admits that it’s not a catch-all solution and that the approach won’t work everywhere, such as particularly performance-sensitive browser components. But the developer says it hopes to see other browsers and software projects implement the technology and that it intends to use it with more of Firefox’s components in the future. Mozilla has also updated its bug bounty program and will now pay researchers if they’re able to bypass the new sandboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reveals millions of videos get hit with incorrect copyright claims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hI4S5QatWSGpqfsLHMtN_DeS5CA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235302/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N4UQ5z"&gt;Over 2.2 million YouTube videos were hit with copyright claims that were later overturned between January and June of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published by the company today. The Copyright Transparency Report is the first of its kind published by YouTube, which says it will update biannually going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoWMD5"&gt;The 2.2 million incorrect claims represent less than 1 percent of the more than 729 million total copyright claims issued in the first half of this year, 99 percent of which originated from Content ID, YouTube’s automated enforcement tool. When users disputed these claims, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBHU5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When users disputed these takedowns, the case was resolved in favor of the uploader of the video 60 percent of the time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5AssGC"&gt;Though mistaken copyright claims are a drop in the bucket on a larger scale, YouTube creators have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;long complained&lt;/a&gt; about how the platform handles claims, saying overly aggressive or unjustified enforcement can lead to lost income. Copyright claims can result in videos being blocked, audio being muted, or ad revenue going back to the rights owner. This new report gives shape to a problem that YouTube itself has acknowledged needs updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fy1eAt"&gt;In 2019, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a blog post that the company heard the concerns from creators and that YouTube was “exploring improvements in striking the right balance between copyright owners and creators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6hp6"&gt;The new report notes that “no system is perfect” and that errors happen even with established guardrails in place to prevent abuse of enforcement mechanisms. “When disputes take place, the process provided by YouTube provides real recourse, and over 60% of these disputes were resolved in favor of the uploader,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber will now let drivers and riders record audio during trips for safety</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6KxwQH5YdEU-oKqEWHRLm6hNjp0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235227/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UCrpXZ"&gt;Uber is releasing its audio-recording feature to three US cities later this month, Uber said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Falways-looking-out%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22814616%2Fuber-new-safety-features-ridecheck-audio-recording" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKEnwK"&gt;At the beginning of a trip, riders and drivers can enable this feature by clicking the shield icon in the app’s Safety Toolkit and selecting “Record Audio.” While both riders and drivers can record individual trips, drivers have the option to leave the feature on while they’re actively seeking rides. The app will notify the rider if the driver is using the feature. Uber first launched audio recording in Latin America in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQz3kf"&gt;The move is the first in-app feature that provides audio documentation of rides. Uber &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/driving-and-delivering/article/can-i-use-a-video-camera-?nodeId=efaad152-cbb6-45fe-9d7d-911842d21c8b"&gt;allows drivers&lt;/a&gt; to use their own dashcams to record rides on their own if local laws permit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7OXeF"&gt;As for audio file privacy, the file is encrypted and stored on rider and driver’s devices, but no one can listen to the audio, even Uber. If either the rider or driver decides to submit a safety report, they can attach the audio file, and a trained Uber safety agent will decrypt and review the recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19OZQs"&gt;Along with audio recording, Uber is releasing audible seat belt alerts soon, according to the press release. The seat belt alert will come from the driver’s phone, and the rider will receive a push notification reminding them to put on their seat belt. Uber said that this feature will be available in the US in early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAM2Ar"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — or NHTSA — &lt;a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813072"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that in 2020, the national seat belt use rate was 90.3 percent. NHTSA also &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/seat-belts"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that of the 22,415 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47 percent were not wearing seat belts. NHTSA said they found no significant changes in seat belt use from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wRyaWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;of the 22,415 passenger vehicle occupants killed in 2019, 47 percent were not wearing seat belts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NSvLDT"&gt;Uber also announced enhancements for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868466/uber-ridecheck-detect-vehicle-crashes-smartphone-driver-gps"&gt;its RideCheck feature&lt;/a&gt;, first launched in 2019 to detect accidents and unusual long stops. Now, RideCheck can now detect when Uber drivers take an unexpected route or when a trip ends abruptly before the final destination. If detected, riders and drivers will receive a notification to make sure everything is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvqZMF"&gt;Uber first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;published a safety report&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 looking at data between 2017 and 2018 following increased complaints from occupants regarding its safety practices. Ultimately, these observations included the safety of drivers who have also complained to the company about rider behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G81n1M"&gt;Uber has been steadily releasing new safety features in response to both riders and drivers experiencing unsafe conditions during their trips, including allegations of sexual assault. In March, Uber, along with its competitor Lyft, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325675/uber-lyft-driver-deactivate-assault-murder-share-safety"&gt;announced that it would share&lt;/a&gt; information about drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05XEA5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This AI art app is a glimpse at the future of synthetic media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qrUQnMvQG3cr_3Rk2WnA3dHgzbc=/167x0:3047x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235161/dream_wombo_ai_art_examples.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few example images generated by the Dream app. You can see the prompts used at the bottom of the picture. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fnubep"&gt;If you’ve been hanging out on Twitter lately, then you’ve probably noticed a profusion of AI-generated images sprouting all over your timeline like weird, algorithmic visions. These pictures have been generated using a &lt;a href="https://app.wombo.art/"&gt;new app called Dream&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone create “AI-powered paintings” by simply typing a brief description of what they want to see. It’s odd, often uncanny stuff — and extremely fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTlMjq"&gt;The resulting artwork has its own particular aesthetic, defined by swirling shapes and incoherent objects. The real magic, though, is that no matter what you type, the app will generate something that is visually compelling (at least until we get too used to these toys) and that matches your prompt in often surprisingly apposite ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYB12h"&gt;Consider, for example, the image below: “Galactic Archaeology With Metal-Poor Stars.” Not only has the app created a picture that captures the mind-boggling galactic scale of a nebula, but the star-like highlights dotted around the space are mostly blue — a tint that is &lt;a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/20219/relationship-between-metallicity-and-color-should-pop-i-stars-be-blue"&gt;scientifically accurate&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;metal-poor&lt;/em&gt; stars (as metallicity affects their color). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2xkb9"&gt;A few &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wombo.art%2F&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;quick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=wombo%20dream&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=top"&gt;searches&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter reveal plenty more examples, but really, you should have a play with the app yourself to understand it better. (If nothing else, the images it generates are exactly the right size to create a personalized wallpaper for your phone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E6Wscw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Galactic Archaeology With Metal-Poor Stars” &lt;a href="https://t.co/0z2R1IQgbL"&gt;https://t.co/0z2R1IQgbL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CXmFEDwc8F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CXmFEDwc8F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Kaitlin Rasmussen (@toomanyspectra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/toomanyspectra/status/1467315733503754240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YT292B"&gt;This sort of AI-generated artwork is not new, but it is becoming higher quality and more accessible. Past examples of these sorts of text-to-image models have included research-orientated programs like &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/"&gt;DALL-E &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://alexasteinbruck.medium.com/vqgan-clip-how-does-it-work-210a5dca5e52"&gt;VQGAN+CLIP&lt;/a&gt;, as well as more specialized commercial projects like &lt;a href="https://www.artbreeder.com/landing_page/"&gt;Artbreeder&lt;/a&gt; (which is particularly good at creating portraits of fictional beings and people). With tools such as these, the AI art scene has exploded in recent years, with practitioners creating everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395115/roman-emperors-photorealistic-portraits-ai-artbreeder-dan-voshart"&gt;lifelike Roman emperors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/"&gt;infinite waifus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nzC649"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI-generated art is quickly improving in both quality and accessibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFuYaC"&gt;The Dream app takes things a step further with its speed, quality, and accessibility. It’s available on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/wombo-dream/id1586366816"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.womboai.wombodream&amp;amp;utm_source=web-app&amp;amp;utm_campaign=web-app&amp;amp;pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://app.wombo.art/"&gt;and the web&lt;/a&gt; and is the work of a Canadian startup named Wombo. The company previously made that AI-powered app that lets you feed in static images to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323271/wombo-ai-memes-deepfake-app-lip-sync"&gt;create lip-synced renditions&lt;/a&gt; of memeable songs. What exactly powers Dream isn’t clear (we’ve contacted Wombo to find out), but a lot of AI art tech is open-source, which means the firm has likely built on past work to create the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkhMyf"&gt;Generally, programs like these are trained on vision datasets — huge libraries of images that are tagged based on objects and scenery. The programs pick out consistent patterns and themes in these images and then use this information to try and generate something that matches the users’ prompt. We don’t know what dataset Dream’s algorithms were trained on, but based on its output, it’s safe to say it includes a wide range of imagery — able to generate pictures that correspond to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CanalBrushRush/status/1466518885931397121"&gt;anime characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Reecee_yt/status/1465057776560967681"&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dINF8M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Found an app that is an ai attempting to make art and honestly??? This shit be popping off. I could never render these colors so vibrantly. &lt;br&gt;These were all created with the words “Knight armor” in Wombo Dream. Like??? They are gorgeous??? &lt;a href="https://t.co/mEANARv8Qm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mEANARv8Qm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MotherLyra (@Lyraa121) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Lyraa121/status/1462336815613067271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1ru1U"&gt;The accessibility of Dream means it’s being put to novel uses, too. It’s been used for viral games (like inputting your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KaySocLearn/status/1467527596250333187"&gt;PhD thesis title&lt;/a&gt; and sharing the result) and for more directed projects as well. In one amazing Twitter thread, the writer and illustrator Ursula Vernon (who publishes under the name T. Kingfisher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467652391059214337"&gt;shared a short comic&lt;/a&gt; they’d made using Dream. The comic’s characters are drawn by hand, but the backgrounds are AI-generated, with the surreal, shifting quality of the images explained as a result of the setting: a dream library overseen by the Egyptian god of writing, Thoth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftw6Lh"&gt;Vernon tweeted about her experience, noting that she had to do a not-insignificant amount of work to prepare the images and that the inability of the program to create scenery from within a space with consistent architecture created its own challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1usH3s"&gt;“In Conclusion—does it work visually? I think the answer is ‘sort of,’” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467657377809940482"&gt;tweeted Vernon&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m very aware of the weirdnesses as an artist, obviously. As a dream sequence, the messed up architecture kinda works, but how long can you get away with it? Sooner or later, the reader is probably gonna notice that nothing takes place in the same scene from a different angle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lWFY5d"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So this weekend, armed with a couple of AI art programs, I started noodling around to see what I could do, and if I could put together one of my Weird Little Comic ideas using mostly retouched computer generated imagery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These nine pages were the result. &lt;a href="https://t.co/POXoBN0Hbx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/POXoBN0Hbx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kingfisher &amp;amp; Wombat (@UrsulaV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UrsulaV/status/1467652391059214337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w0aIKA"&gt;Despite its obvious limitations, Dream shows us a glimpse of the future of synthetic or AI-generated media. For evangelists in this space, the promise of the technology is one of infinite variety. In the future, they say, games, comics, films, and books will all be generated on the fly in response to our every prompt and whim. And although we’re a long, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; way from such media matching the quality of human output, limited, hybrid applications will be coming sooner than you think — appearing like something first glimpsed in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors’ mega SPAC merger is under investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fe8sYrAGKQTtlzHq9-SVvkRph8E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235159/ahawkins_210623_4646_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QT5kt2"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating yet another merger between an EV startup and a special purpose acquisition company, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. This time, it’s the massive deal from July that turned Saudi-owned Lucid Motors into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;a publicly traded company worth more than $20 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUBWSP"&gt;Lucid Motors announced the probe in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000110465921146500/tm2134520d5_424b3.htm"&gt;a Monday morning stock exchange filing&lt;/a&gt;. The startup said that it received a subpoena from the SEC on December 3rd “requesting the production of certain documents related to an investigation” that “appears to concern” the merger, as well as “certain projections and statements.” Lucid Motors said it’s “cooperating fully with the SEC in its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dvLUw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BduTOx"&gt;The startup, which was founded in 2007 as a battery tech company and rescued by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt; that it was merging with a SPAC run by investor Michael Klein called Churchill Capital IV. Lucid Motors ultimately raised more than $4 billion in the deal and started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784017/lucid-motors-valuation-ford-spac-air-sedan-deliveries"&gt;shipping its first electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; — the Air sedan — in October. The startup’s valuation had soared since, and it recently passed the market cap of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784017/lucid-motors-valuation-ford-spac-air-sedan-deliveries"&gt;legacy automakers like Ford&lt;/a&gt;. But Monday’s news sent Lucid Motors’ stock tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oL5jLv"&gt;The SEC is already investigating the SPAC mergers that turned Lordstown Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and Nikola into publicly traded electric vehicle startups. The agency has been particularly focused on the validity of the financial projections these companies made when they announced the mergers, as well as any claims they made about the preorders collected for their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4Qo6h"&gt;Nikola’s founder was indicted earlier this year on charges brought by the SEC (as well as parallel charges from the Department of Justice), and the company recently said it has set aside $125 million for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/nikola-expects-125-million-sec-penalty-under-proposed-resolution.html"&gt;an expected settlement with the agency&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors’ CEO resigned after the company’s own investigation found he had made misleading claims about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;preorders for its electric pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, though the SEC and DOJ are still probing the startup. Canoo said as recently as November that it continues to cooperate with the SEC in its own investigation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea Nordmärke portable wireless charger details revealed by the FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SB3-NvcigpQ_FvfS2ecS77c3Jvw=/0x0:1619x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235102/ikea3.001.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;FCC filing of the new IKEA Nordmärke portable qi wireless power bank | Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MCJz2L"&gt;Ikea is starting to distribute a new wireless charging puck with a built-in battery. The discovery of this Nordmärke-branded portable charger came from a reader of German tech news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.mobiflip.de/shortnews/ikea-nordmaerke-qi-laden-akku/"&gt;mobiFlip&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-nordmarke-qi-charger-leak-203043188.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who purchased the product from an Ikea in Cologne for €19.99 Euros ($22.57).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvIs6U"&gt;We couldn’t find any references to the new charger on Ikea’s website, however, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to locate &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108"&gt;the company’s filing with the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, where the product is listed with ID FHO-E2108.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This is the Ikea wireless charging puck upside down and cut in half showing the electronics inside. Two yellow cylinders are visible which are the battery cells, covered in glue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OklXSNa1QgE4MhrfilNDbwKD9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066152/ikeachargerbatt.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Ikea Nordmärke wireless charger cut in half, presenting nonremovable 18650 cells.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0u4NAK"&gt;The wireless charger carries the same label as Ikea’s other Qi-enabled wireless charging pads, which come in various circular and rectangular plastic bodies finished with materials such as cork and fabric. The new charger is also outfitted in gray fabric — but comes in a square shape and enough height to accommodate the batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qtRW4"&gt;The bottom of the charger mentions that the Li-ion battery’s capacity is 24Wh (6,500mAh) and uses a common 18650 cell. Based on the internal images, the charger contains two heavily adhered and soldered 18650 cells — rendering the batteries hardly user-replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wig6di"&gt;Ikea’s new charger, much like the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsearch%2Fproducts%2F%3Fq%3Dwireless%2520charging&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22816581%2Fikea-nordmarke-portable-wireless-qi-charger-fcc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677980/ikea-sjomarke-wireless-qi-charging-existing-furniture"&gt;wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt;, operates at a sleepy 5W rate. According to the FCC-filed &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2108/Users-Manual/E2108-User-Manual-Rev1-5558655"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; for this Nordmärke charger, the device needs a 10W USB-C power supply — but you’ll have to bring your own charging source and cable. Expect to start seeing these rolled out into Ikea stores in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix Awakens is an interactive tech demo for PS5 and Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zOb0W7TsB_IKl2m4ojwN0g1Ti8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234957/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_12_06_15_32_47.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CRcZ3y"&gt;Epic Games has created &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, an interactive tech demo built in Unreal Engine 5. A teaser for the interactive &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; experience appeared today, and the tech demo will be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles. You can pre-install the demo right now (29GB) &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP1464-PPSA05754_00-MATRIXUNREALDEMO"&gt;on PS5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience%2F9ng8rk1f3hcc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820392%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-epic-games-tech-demo-unreal-engine-5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, and it will launch during The Game Awards on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nDHLj"&gt;Members of the original movie team, including Lana Wachowski, have worked with Epic Games to create &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;. The Xbox store listing promises “a wild ride into the reality-bending universe of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; that features performances by Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48ygme"&gt;The teaser video appears to show a digital version of Keanu Reeves and not the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; kind. “How do we know what is real?” Reeves asks, mysteriously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5o78Vss-KZD-gLf_5SU1Fvr8WNM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067059/JC1uYno.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this another digital Keanu Reeves?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IkadvX"&gt;Epic Games originally announced its Unreal Engine 5 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date"&gt;stunning PlayStation 5 tech demo last year&lt;/a&gt;. It included photo-realistic lighting, incredibly visual quality, and a level of game detail that Unreal Engine 5 promises to deliver for next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CKZni"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;tech demo could be equally impressive, with the teaser claiming it will offer “a glimpse into the future of interactive storytelling and entertainment with UE5 in this free, boundary-pushing cinematic and real-time tech demo.” It arrives just ahead of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; theater release on December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash launches ‘ultra-fast’ delivery in NYC, with couriers who are actual employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZW2DE-pSXexPuT1uiM-gSumueY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234913/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash “fast” delivery comes to New York Cityfv | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Cp4RR"&gt;Food delivery platform DoorDash has &lt;a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Introduces-Ultra-Fast-Grocery-Delivery-Providing-Busy-Consumers-with-a-Reliable-and-Convenient-Way-to-Restock-Instantly/default.aspx"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its “ultra-fast” DashMart delivery service in New York City because apparently delivery &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;couriers aren’t already frazzled enough&lt;/a&gt; and no one can possibly wait more than 15 minutes for anything (not quite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95516647"&gt;what Andy Warhol predicted&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re way past that now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWBaqA"&gt;However, there is a key difference between the delivery jobs on the main DoorDash platform and positions with the new DashMart fast delivery service: DashMart workers will be part of what the company calls DashCorps, considered full- and part-time employees — instead of independent contractors — and many will be eligible for benefits. DashCorps workers will have set schedules and be paid $15 per hour, plus tips, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1"&gt;To start in NYC, the ultra-fast deliveries — which will arrive within 10 to 15 minutes of order times — will come from a DashMart location in Chelsea that’s open from 7AM to 2AM daily, with more locations to follow soon. The Chelsea DashMart has more than 2,000 items including fresh and frozen foods, household goods, and local products, the company says. Customers can order via the DoorDash app or website; those who have its DashPass membership won’t be charged delivery fees. DoorDash will donate excess DashMart produce to a local community food bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdCJlU"&gt;“Achieving ultra-fast delivery times inherently requires more structure and organization to ensure orders are fulfilled quickly and merchant and customer expectations are met,” the company’s director of new verticals Andrew Ladd &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/12/06/introducing-ultra-fast-deliveries-with-doordash/"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. DashCorps workers will use a different app than workers for the standard DoorDash platform, wear uniforms, and in addition to deliveries, will perform other tasks including stocking shelves, customer support, and administrative work. The roles are “fundamentally different from dashing,” Ladd added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QZlF62"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cF3JbK"&gt;DoorDash first &lt;a href="https://blog.doordash.com/introducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d"&gt;announced the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its DashMart stores in eight cities in August 2020. Unlike the Chelsea location, the first DashMarts didn’t have brick-and-mortar locations, functioning kind of like ghost kitchens for convenience stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23IllV"&gt;Why would someone want to continue working for the main DoorDash platform when the seemingly more attractive DashCorps jobs are available? Ladd writes that the “binary choice between working as an employee or an independent contractor” is “outdated and doesn’t reflect the needs of the modern workforce.” Its independent contractor “Dashers” prefer the flexibility over their schedules that DoorDash offers, the company claims, and “we’re steadfastly committed to protecting and strengthening this independent workforce.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FA7iTA"&gt;The benefits for those DashCorps workers who are eligible would include those that “traditionally come with employment,” including medical, dental, vision, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAitFw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
