    <title>Epic is giving away 15 free games during its holiday sale, and the first is Shenmue III</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWtnNjlmR5Fx0OGa0mCdQoL4q5A=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283311/epic_games_store_holiday_sale_15_days_of_free_games_day_1_shenmue_3_1920x1080_695145bd5ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shenmue III is one of 15 games Epic is giving away.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HbubWI"&gt;Epic Games’ annual holiday sale is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/massive-discounts-and-limitless-10-off-coupons-hit-the-epic-games-store"&gt;now live&lt;/a&gt;, and in addition to offering some nice discounts on many titles, the company will also be giving away 15 free games. Epic is also bringing back the Epic Coupon, which gives you $10 off games that cost more than $14.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAdbHD"&gt;The first freebie is &lt;em&gt;Shenmue III&lt;/em&gt;, which began life as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/16/8788395/shenmue-3-kickstarter-funded-release-date"&gt;hugely popular Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. The company hasn’t said what games are next, and Epic spokesperson Nick Chester declined to comment on what games are coming down the pike — you’ll have to check the store every day to see what Epic is offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SPY0jN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Epic Coupon is a good deal, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lERu6F"&gt;While you’re browsing the store, you’ll want to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/massive-discounts-and-limitless-10-off-coupons-hit-the-epic-games-store"&gt;Epic Coupon in mind&lt;/a&gt;. It gives you $10 off &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; title that’s more than $14.99 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has no limit to how many games you can use it with, so feel free to load up your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826563/epic-games-store-shopping-cart"&gt;(newly added) shopping cart&lt;/a&gt;. The sale runs until January 6th at 11AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voao6P"&gt;Epic has also kicked off its annual holiday event in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; where players can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22838346/fortnite-holiday-event-2021-spider-man-tom-holland"&gt;unlock free stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast delays new data caps for at least another year, which is weird because it should be forever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xfinity Truck" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJDzORT4mbTVd85ltEwp_Ow2XuA=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283297/1209128540.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WccXr5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"&gt;The majority&lt;/a&gt; of Comcast Xfinity internet customers have suffered ridiculous and unnecessary data caps since 2016, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;planned to extend those caps&lt;/a&gt; to a dozen more US states this year. But after taking well-deserved flak for attempting to bilk customers in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Comcast delayed them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;once&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291469/comcast-delays-northeast-data-cap-rollout-2022"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and now a third time — now they won’t arrive until 2023 at the earliest, &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-tech/comcast-will-keep-data-caps-out-of-the-northeast-in-2022/d/d-id/774117"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joTtsb"&gt;“We don’t have plans to implement our data usage plan in our Northeast markets in 2022 at this time,” a Comcast spokesperson told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep8n5h"&gt;Does that mean the planned 1.2TB data cap for those states is gone for good, or is Comcast simply biding its time? Hard to say. Technically, “We don’t have plans ... at this time” is a turn of phrase with plenty of wiggle room: Comcast could make new plans tomorrow if it wanted. It just wouldn’t be good for the company’s public image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F36JWM"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Light Reading &lt;/em&gt;suggests it &lt;em&gt;might actually &lt;/em&gt;be an end to that plan, because Massachusetts State Representative Andy Vargas (D) is &lt;a href="https://whav.net/2021/12/15/rep-vargas-calls-comcasts-abandonment-of-data-caps-and-penalties-a-huge-win/"&gt;claiming a political victory&lt;/a&gt; — he says he helped get Comcast to abandon the expansion of its data caps altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wClm3f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Comcast, which postponed its planned data caps and penalties on northeast customers when it came under fire at the peak of the current pandemic, has abandoned the plan altogether.&lt;/p&gt;— Andy X. Vargas (@RepAndyVargas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyVargas/status/1471109200466096132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HBvge"&gt;To which I say: what about the rest of us? The majority of Comcast internet customers are already limited to that same 1.2TB unless we pay Comcast an extra $30-a-month surcharge for unlimited data, or paying $10 per 50GB per month when we go over, and the same logic Vargas and co. used should apply to the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2qweK"&gt;In case you’re not convinced that data caps are unnecessary, here’s a snippet of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;a popular story I wrote almost exactly one year ago&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yttV3K"&gt;Forget for a moment that Comcast itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2015/11/7/9687976/comcast-data-caps-are-not-about-fixing-network-congestion"&gt;was caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; explaining that data caps have nothing to do with network congestion. Forget that the CEOs of several smaller ISPs &lt;a href="https://money.com/internet-data-caps-bogus-ploys/"&gt;have admitted that internet capacity is anything but scarce&lt;/a&gt;. Forget that Comcast &lt;em&gt;disabled its own congestion management system&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/comcast-says-it-doesnt-throttle-heaviest-internet-users-anymore/"&gt;because it found it was unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. Forget even that Comcast is a wildly profitable company whose cable division spends &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-4th-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only a tenth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of its yearly revenues on keeping that network strong. The proof that data caps are a swindle is something you probably witnessed yourself earlier this year: Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179330/comcast-t-mobile-coronavirus-data-caps-hotspots-fcc"&gt;suspended their data caps&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and the internet kept on working without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EbzsOU"&gt;Just remember: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365753/wow-wideopenwest-internet-cable-data-cap-pizza-excuse"&gt;internet data caps are not like pizza&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt8PPE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tVoNJf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A cable company that prided itself on no data caps says you’re getting data caps because pizza","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365753/wow-wideopenwest-internet-cable-data-cap-pizza-excuse"},{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="y4rQuu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian will build a second, $5 billion EV plant in Georgia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQHOO7n2P-3RVw1E8Cavhn-HJwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283222/mclark_210923_4776_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZoFg65"&gt;Amazon-backed EV startup Rivian is going to build a second factory in Georgia where it will assemble up to 400,000 electric vehicles per year. The company &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521359139/d236890dex992.htm"&gt;made the announcement on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; alongside state representatives after months of speculation over where it would look to expand its manufacturing footprint. Rivian will start construction of the $5 billion facility in the summer of 2022 and expects to start making vehicles there in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsqZEZ"&gt;Rivian is already building its first electric pickup trucks at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois. But the company is getting ready to start building its electric SUV and is committed to producing 100,000 custom delivery vans for Amazon, so it has been searching for a place to create a factory from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Exafpi"&gt;Rivian &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/rivian-in-talks-to-build-ev-factory-near-fort-worth-texas"&gt;had been in talks with Forth Worth, Texas&lt;/a&gt; to build the new factory there and was evaluating “multiple locations” as recently as August. The new factory in Georgia will be built about an hour east of Atlanta and will employ 7,500 workers. Rivian says it plans to build a “co-located” battery cell production facility in the area as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WFr12"&gt;Founded in 2009, Rivian took a slow path to where it is today. It didn’t come out of stealth mode until 2018, shortly before it debuted the pickup truck (the R1T) and SUV (the R1S) at that year’s LA Auto Show. Since then, though, it has been on an incredible rise. It has hired thousands of employees, collected billions of dollars in funding from Amazon, Ford, T. Rowe Price, and others, and recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;went public in one of the biggest IPOs in US history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2biot"&gt;The startup’s grand ambitions come with a high price tag, though, as it has said it expects to spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;$8 billion through the end of 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian revealed Thursday that it lost $1.23 billion in the third quarter of 2021 alone, though it is finally generating revenue as it delivered the first 11 R1T pickup trucks — good for $1 million in sales. Rivian finished the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash, but says that the proceeds of its IPO and other recent funding rounds have already boosted that figure to $19.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a6Q5T"&gt;Rivian has taken around 55,000 preorders for the R1T and R1S combined and has said that it will take two years to make all those vehicles alongside the Amazon delivery vans. (In Thursday’s regulatory filing, the startup said the number of preorders has gone up to 71,000). But the company has other future models in the works and plans to sell non-delivery vans to other commercial customers, so it needs more capacity. The Illinois plant is currently only able to make as many as 150,000 vehicles per year, though Rivian has said it believes that can be stretched to 200,000 by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eMSBh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sidewalk Labs will be folded into Google as CEO steps down for health reasons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CANADA-REAL-ESTATE-INTERNET-TECHNOLOGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4bh_X2HbN6HgrU0NHDFVqOWTdnc=/0x143:4032x2831/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283045/1179219559.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sidewalk Labs will be folded into Google as its CEO steps down for health reasons.  | Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2Jjes"&gt;Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff is stepping down for health reasons, and the six-year-old company and its products will be folded into Google, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/my-next-chapter-fighting-als-207ce7ca69c8"&gt;he wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. Doctoroff says he’s been diagnosed with what may be ALS and wants to spend more time with his family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D5sWX"&gt;“Starting next year, Sidewalk products Pebble, Mesa, Delve, and Affordable Electrification will join Google, becoming core to Google’s urban sustainability product efforts,” Doctoroff wrote in the post. “These products will continue to be led by Sidewalk Labs President of Urban Products Prem Ramaswami and Chief Technology Officer Craig Nevill-Manning, both Google alumni, and the teams will continue to execute on their vision and serve customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBgp8J"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet will spin out Sidewalk’s Canopy Buildings as an independent company, Doctoroff added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQHKwH"&gt;According to Sidewalk Labs’ website, Pebble is a parking and curb management sensor; Delve is an AI-based real estate development program; Mesa provides kits for commercial businesses to save energy; and Affordable Electrification is a home energy management program. Canopy Buildings designs and manufactures “mass timber” buildings for commercial development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPjDFE"&gt;Sidewalk Labs is perhaps best known for its scuttled plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715486/alphabet-sidewalk-labs-toronto-high-tech-city-within-a-city-plan"&gt;build a smart neighborhood in Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, called Quayside. The billion-dollar project would have built a high-tech community build with sustainable methods and materials, but was unpopular with local residents. The project was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250594/alphabet-sidewalk-labs-toronto-quayside-shutting-down"&gt;shut down in 2020&lt;/a&gt;; Doctoroff said at the time that the economic uncertainty of the pandemic made Quayside financially unfeasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvILr8"&gt;“I leave Sidewalk having complete confidence that our impact will increase exponentially,” Doctoroff wrote Thursday. “While I will dearly miss working with the incomparable Sidewalk Labs team, I couldn’t be more excited to see Google accelerate the development of our products and technology to achieve their sustainability mission — not a moment too soon for the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 console bundles in-store on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNavx3OJfdavVFpChqU7EzA-Ad0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282982/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;GameStop has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a special in-store sales event&lt;/a&gt; for the hard-to-get Sony PlayStation 5 console, taking place on December 17th. The restock event requires &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergegamestopinstoreps5&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt; — which normally runs $14.99 per year but is currently discounted to $9.99 once added to your cart. GameStop &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/12-17_PS5Event_StoreList"&gt;lists all its participating retail locations&lt;/a&gt; on its site, which spans over 700 stores across the US. While this event is being hosted at many locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Dqxf"&gt;Despite launching over one year ago, Sony’s PlayStation 5 is still very difficult to buy. If you have been struggling to luck out on recent online console restocks from GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, or other vendors, this may be one of the few remaining chances to score a PS5 in time for the Christmas holiday. GameStop sells its new consoles in bundle form only, so while you should not be paying more than MSRP, you can expect to potentially pay upwards of $700 or $800 depending on what accessories are being bundled. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJGkl0rcX9GKuxbSxxUzV0iDmUQ=/69x0:821x501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282902/01_Meta_and_ZP_Better_Together_VRS_on_Portal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Portal now offers sign language interpreters | Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbshGz"&gt;Facebook parent company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/video-relay-services-on-meta-portal/"&gt;Meta is adding video relay services&lt;/a&gt; (VRS) to its Portal video calling devices, allowing users to bring English or Spanish sign language interpreters into video conversations. The new feature is part of a collaboration with ZP Better Together, a tech firm that makes communication solutions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hm4pq"&gt;Meta spokesperson Lisa Auslen explained in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that users will need to apply for a ZP account to confirm they’re eligible for the service, which is federally funded under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Both the service and the Portal devices are free for those who qualify; they must be VRS users in the US who communicate using ASL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAtODx"&gt;Once the user has their ZP account and their Portal, the ASL interpreter service can be accessed through ZP’s apps available in the Portal App Store. The American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters appear on-screen during Portal calls and are available 24/7, the company said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVXAFU"&gt;Video calling became ubiquitous during the pandemic, and even though video-calling services like &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-live-captions-in-a-teams-meeting-4be2d304-f675-4b57-8347-cbd000a21260"&gt;Microsoft’s Teams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744704/zoom-auto-generated-captions-available-free-accounts-accessibility"&gt;Zoom have closed captions&lt;/a&gt;, nuance in conversations &lt;a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/deaf-community-faces-extreme-lack-of-access-during-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;can be lost&lt;/a&gt; without a sign language interpreter providing tone and context. And as Meta notes, sign language is the primary language for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community, so the addition provides a new level of accessibility to Portal calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL4aKd"&gt;People who are Deaf or hard of hearing can apply to receive a Portal device for free at &lt;a href="https://portal.zpvrs.com/"&gt;portal.zpvrs.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As promised, Nokia phones started getting Android 12 this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6Ury3w_zy1QZ2X2zQVU4y49ZSc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282874/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X20 is HMD Global’s first device to get Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mZCT2X"&gt;HMD Global offered its first Android 12 update this week, starting with the midrange Nokia X20. The company says &lt;a href="https://community.phones.nokia.com/discussion/64559/android-12-on-nokia-x20"&gt;users in this first wave&lt;/a&gt; will receive the update by December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQvmdb"&gt;Good. That’s what HMD said it would do, and it’s doing just that. We love to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfq1o7"&gt;You’re forgiven if you forgot that the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-x-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839883%2Fnokia-x20-android-12-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; exists — it’s a mostly unremarkable device with a 6.67-inch 60Hz display, Snapdragon 480 processor, and four rear-facing cameras. In fact, its most compelling features might just be its healthy support policy (three years of OS updates) and an unusually generous three-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E0TWvj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kV0pax"&gt;That’s a great policy in theory — as my colleague Jon Porter pointed out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;his hands-on with the X20&lt;/a&gt;, the phone should still be under warranty when it gets Android 14. But there’s no real guarantee that HMD (or any Android device maker for that matter) will follow through with its promise of continuing OS updates. To that end, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811988/hmd-global-nokia-9-pureview-android-11-software"&gt;recently backtracked on its promise&lt;/a&gt; to bring Android 11 to the Nokia 9 PureView. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF2h4z"&gt;And generally speaking, the Android 12 rollout has been a rocky one. OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;pulled its buggy Android 12-based OxygenOS update&lt;/a&gt; for the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 owners &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-android-12-problems-issues-update-postponed/"&gt;have also reported issues&lt;/a&gt; with the stable Android 12 update. Google’s own Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;appear to be afflicted&lt;/a&gt;, too. Even a so-called stable Android 12 release for Nokia phones could prove to be equally unstable. But if the X20 is to live up to its promised three-year lifespan, it’s certainly starting on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Treasury claims DJI assists Chinese surveillance of Uyghurs and blocks investments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8sDFru7IaLBDPp4tHgNI_TpWlw=/0x1:2048x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282872/DJI_Mavic_3___Forest_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7kWKAX"&gt;DJI is one of the biggest drone companies in the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;last year, the US government added it to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List&lt;/a&gt;, which marked it as a national security concern and banned US-based companies from exporting technology to it. &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20211216"&gt;Today, the Treasury Department placed further sanctions on DJI&lt;/a&gt;, including it as one of eight Chinese companies added to the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQJxMq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0538"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Treasury:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KK1X7U"&gt;Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified eight Chinese technology firms pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13959, as amended by E.O. 14032. These eight entities actively support the biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in China, particularly the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang. As a result of today’s action, U.S. persons will be prohibited from purchasing or selling certain publicly traded securities connected with these entities, as described in E.O. 13959, as amended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHuTB6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbNNk1"&gt;SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. (SZ DJI) operates or has operated in the surveillance technology sector of the economy of the PRC. SZ DJI has provided drones to the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, which are used to surveil Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The Xinjiang Public Security Bureau was previously &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1055"&gt;designated&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020, pursuant to E.O. 13818, for being a foreign person responsible for, or complicit in, or that has directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OOYyol"&gt;As described in the sections of the statement shown above, the US government says these companies have supported efforts to surveil and track the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. Last week, the White House announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to those activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QncRr7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today, Treasury’s OFAC identified 8 Chinese technology firms as part of the Chinese Military Industrial Complex. These 8 entities actively support the biometric surveillance &amp;amp; tracking of ethnic &amp;amp; religious minorities in China.&lt;a href="https://t.co/MpGbAhsMxP"&gt;https://t.co/MpGbAhsMxP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Treasury Department (@USTreasury) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USTreasury/status/1471560495027077142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WEjzDD"&gt;During a press conference yesterday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian was asked about the ban and &lt;a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202112/t20211215_10470159.html"&gt;responded by saying&lt;/a&gt;, “We noted relevant reports. I would like to stress that China always opposes US moves to overstretch the concept of national security and exert unwarranted suppression on Chinese companies. The Chinese side has already shared the facts and truth on Xinjiang-related issues on many occasions. We will closely follow the relevant situation and firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGttBf"&gt;DJI spokesperson Adam Lisberg did not comment on today’s action but referred to the company’s response to last year’s sanctions, which reads as follows: “DJI has done nothing to justify being placed on the Entity List. We have always focused on building products that save lives and benefit society. DJI and its employees remain committed to providing our customers with the industry’s most innovative technology. We are evaluating options to ensure our customers, partners, and suppliers are treated fairly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o2frj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s latest acquisition is about making money off radio shows turned into podcasts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgLWyfXeiH1GgHEB4JqbJBS1eDQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282752/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZIR34"&gt;Spotify continues to beef up its audio product arsenal. Today, it &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/spotify-is-building-on-megaphones-capabilities-with-the-acquisition-of-whooshkaa/"&gt;announced the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/"&gt;Whooshkaa&lt;/a&gt;, a nearly six-year-old Australian company focused on helping radio broadcasters monetize, edit, and distribute their shows as podcasts. Spotify says some radio broadcasters, like the Australian Radio Network, already rely on its podcast hosting platform Megaphone, and this Whooshkaa radio technology will be integrated into it. The selling price was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMjdu7"&gt;Radio networks will be able to prepare shows for publishing by capturing live broadcasts and using the Whooshkaa tech to edit and remove ads to make room for podcast-only spots. From there, Megaphone can host the shows, and Spotify can help the shows monetize by encouraging them to take advantage of the Spotify Ad Network, thereby allowing Spotify to insert ads dynamically based on the audience these programs reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fesJm9"&gt;The acquisition makes sense for Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s vision of audio’s future. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295315/spotify-ceo-interview-podcast-daniel-ek-music-stream-on"&gt;he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; traditional radio was dying. “If you think over the next 10 years for certain, what’s now radio is going to collapse and move from a linear space to an on-demand space,” he said. “That’s where I think we’re in this race to try to get as many people as possible to convert into streaming on demand and hopefully choose Spotify as their preferred platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZBnNA"&gt;If that reality plays out, Spotify could be in a place to take a heavier hand in all aspects of that transition, but most notably, selling the ads for those broadcast shows. Other companies, namely in the radio space, are also investing in similar technology. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287309/podcast-iheart-media-triton-digital-acquire-spotify"&gt;iHeartMedia acquired Triton Digital&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://omnystudio.com/learn"&gt;Omny Studio&lt;/a&gt;, which also offers both live broadcast to on-demand technology, hosting, and monetization options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available at Best Buy right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRlsbB8OpYzqHGItWg8bJuSkq2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282619/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PEdX6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:25PM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now. This one lasted a bit longer than some recent restocks, though availability seemed dependent on your location and proximity to Best Buy stores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4bhQA"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console and have been recently striking out with restocks at Walmart, Costco, and other retailers, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is only selling the disc-based version, however, not the Digital Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. After that, you should be able to see if there are any PS5 consoles available in your area (it’s currently only available for in-store pickup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URumo"&gt;We know time is getting short if you want Sony’s next-gen console under the tree in a couple of weeks, and we are continuing to track restocks as they roll out at various retailers. Be sure to also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest tech and gadget savings we can find and deliver right to your inbox twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SacwVZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"Sony’s new PS5 faceplates come in black and colorful options","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831965/sony-ps5-covers-faceplates-colors-new-controllers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="eqORRo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rlMz0K"&gt;Some essential PS5 extras to consider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mSaDm8"&gt;If you do manage to secure a PS5, there are a few extra accessories and games we highly recommend you pick up alongside your console or shortly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
