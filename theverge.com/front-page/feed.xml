    <title>Instagram decision to remove ayahuasca post overturned by Meta Oversight Board</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta’s independent Oversight Board overturned an Instagram decision to remove a post about ayahuasca | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VQQX3z"&gt;The Oversight Board for Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta has &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/1780492362340442-oversight-board-overturns-meta-s-decision-case-2021-013-ig-ua/"&gt;overturned a decision&lt;/a&gt; by the photo-sharing app to remove a post that discussed ayahuasca. The board found that while the July post from a spiritual school in Brazil violated a Facebook rule against promoting the use of non-medical drugs, it did not violate Instagram’s community guidelines “as they were articulated at the time.” The board said Meta needs to be clearer when it applies Facebook rules to Instagram content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqFale"&gt;“The Board is concerned that the company continues to apply FB’s Community Standards on IG without transparently telling users it is doing so,” it wrote in its decision. The Instagram rule at the time of the removal only covered the sale and purchase of illegal or prescription drugs, the board added. “The Board does not understand why Meta cannot immediately update the language in Instagram’s Community Guidelines to tell users this. Meta also did not tell the user in this case what part of its rules they violated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TtYAJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You can now appeal for Facebook’s Oversight Board to take down bad posts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381499/facebook-oversight-board-remove-posts-appeals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dl6CG2"&gt;The Oversight Board further took issue with the stated reason removing the post: to protect public health because “the user described ayahuasca with a heart emoji, referred to it as ‘medicine,’ and stated that it ‘can help you.’” The post discussed ayahuasca in a religious context, and the school didn’t post instructions for using the drug. The board recommended Meta change its rules on regulated goods to be respectful of diverse cultural practices, “to allow positive discussion of religious issues of non-medical drugs which have a recognized traditional or religious use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBWFpf"&gt;Ayahuasca is a plant-based psychedelic, usually prepared as a tea that provides a high, which can include hallucinations. It’s traditionally used as a spiritual and ceremonial medicine by people in the Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRMLlb"&gt;The Oversight Board also released its &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/640697330273796-oversight-board-publishes-transparency-report-for-third-quarter-of-2021/"&gt;third-quarter transparency report&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday and said between July and September, it had received 64 percent more cases, or 339,000, for possible review than it had in the second quarter. Among the cases it was referred, about 34 percent were related to Facebook rules on bullying or harassment, 30 percent had to do with violence and incitement, and 23 percent were related to concerns about hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azlChh"&gt;And of the 25 recommendations from six decisions the Oversight Board made in the quarter, Meta said it would implement more than half of the decisions “fully” or “in part.” The Oversight Board — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870827/facebook-supreme-court-mark-zuckerberg-content-moderation-charter"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook / Meta — heard its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;cases in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It’s meant to interpret company policies but not make new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="wvBJQw"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776850/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review-the-15-inch-chromebook-to-beat"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip CX5&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VMPUxM"&gt;Best Chromebook with a 15-inch screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qu3aaz"&gt;Folks may understandably balk at the Chromebook Flip CX5’s price, but it really is that good. It’s sturdy enough to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, and has a unique velvety texture that’s very pleasant to hold. Add a wide port selection, a smooth and comfortable keyboard, and a vivid display, and you’ve got a chassis that can hold its own against plenty of midrange Windows laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcLGGd"&gt;The CX5’s performance is equally impressive. We never once heard its fan in our testing, even when pushing a workload that slows most devices down. Battery life is quite satisfactory and easily lasted us all day. And the CX5 delivered some of the loudest audio we’ve ever heard from a Chromebook. While the CX5 isn’t a perfect device, it’s a solid performer all around. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors makes moves to source rare earth metals for EV motors in North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P2LfpCJaoMSxlXYXUVfK8hs0PjE=/0x0:5632x3755/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249701/GM_UltiumDrive_003_255_kW_EVmotor.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VMoNwA"&gt;General Motors announced a deal to source rare earth metals for electric vehicle motors in North America. Under the agreement, Las Vegas-based MP Materials will supply the automaker with “US-sourced and manufactured rare earth materials, alloy, and finished magnets for the electric motors” that will be used to power GM’s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mAnLa"&gt;Electric motors are powered by permanent magnets, sometimes no larger than a pack of playing cards, that are made of rare earth metals. The magnets enable the motors to transform electricity into motion, thus powering the vehicle. But these rare earth magnets, mostly made of neodymium (NdFeB), are almost entirely mined and processed in China. And as tensions grow between China and the US, automakers are under increasing pressure to find more localized sources of these key materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QybZjB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The magnets enable the motors to transform electricity into motion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bexC8O"&gt;GM has said it plans to become an EV-only company by 2040, meaning it will need to make millions of electric motors every year. In a call with reporters, the company’s executives said that this agreement with MP Materials, in addition to other recent announcements, will help ensure that most of the materials that comprise its Ultium EV platform will come from within North America by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx1m13"&gt;“I think most people outside our industry would be shocked to learn that there are virtually no factories in the US building these magnets at scale,” said Shilpan Amin, GM vice president for global purchasing and supply chain. “Well that’s about to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBgPPG"&gt;GM said it picked MP Materials for its location and capacity to produce rare earth materials at scale. The company owns and operates a rare earth mine and processing facility in Mountain Pass, California. The materials sourced from this facility will be transformed into an NdFeB alloy and magnets at a new production factory that MP Materials will build in Fort Worth, Texas. The plant is expected to start production in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tYUJNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;500,000 EV motors annually&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NbF3FE"&gt;Once its up and running, the Fort Worth facility will have the capacity to produce “around 1,000 tons of finished magnets per year,” GM said. That amount of rare earth materials has the potential to power approximately 500,000 EV motors annually, the automaker noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Pfrk"&gt;Despite the name, rare earth metals are actually abundant but can be dirty and difficult to produce. China has grown to dominate production, and with &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/mineral-requirements-for-clean-energy-transitions"&gt;demand for the magnets on the rise&lt;/a&gt; for all forms of renewable energy, experts say a shortage may lie ahead. Some automakers have been looking to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-frictions-steer-electric-automakers-away-rare-earth-magnets-2021-07-19/"&gt;replace or limit the use of rare earth materials for years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lNnn9"&gt;Much like the rest of the auto industry, GM is racing to boost its EV offerings, vowing to spend $35 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025. To accomplish this enormous feat, the company is trying to get a stronger grasp on its supply chain, which includes electric motors and battery manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdsP3u"&gt;The company has said it will spend over $4 billion on the construction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;two battery factories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811902/general-motors-cathode-factory-ev-battery-posco"&gt;a new cathode factory&lt;/a&gt; in North America. The company also recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22559718/gm-lithium-ctr-ev-battery-investment-salton-sea"&gt;struck a deal to source lithium&lt;/a&gt;, a key ingredient in electric-car batteries, from geothermal deposits in the US. And it’s building a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709389/gm-wallace-battery-center-ev-ultium-research"&gt;new 300,000-square-foot battery research facility&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan to help make electric vehicle batteries that are longer lasting, quicker to charge, and more sustainable for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEqw6R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhones will be able to give owners a detailed history of what parts were replaced</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtlW9ELdJJfE6WjGpt5djeHB1uw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249538/akrales_170620_1794_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tG9xHD"&gt;Apple is about to add a new feature to iPhones informing users if the device was previously repaired and whether a genuine screen or battery was used (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/ios-15-2-shows-a-service-history-of-repaired-parts-in-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;parts and service history&lt;/a&gt; section will appear (under Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; About) with the upcoming iOS 15.2 update for iPhone — providing some insight and peace of mind for buyers of used or refurbished iPhones hoping to get a proper quality OEM unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtEGWM"&gt;The new update expands on a previous feature that can tell if a screen or battery was not genuine, now adding them in one place and even including a date on when the service was performed. Since the release of the iPhone 11, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;including a warning&lt;/a&gt; when an aftermarket (ungenuine) screen was installed. Now iPhones as old as XR models can warn if a battery is ungenuine, while iPhone 12 and 13 can call out more including the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEQGbR"&gt;Earlier versions of iOS on the iPhone 13 threatened to make screen repairs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764251/iphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt;, requiring microsoldering to avoid a warning label and deactivated Face ID sensors. iOS 15.2  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786274/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes"&gt;updates the process&lt;/a&gt; to allow repairs by users or a third-party shop without a complaint from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYqxLcQmlwwcUAJm69RK6XKJJzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075322/ios15_2_repair.001.jpeg.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15.2 with new Parts and Service History section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6HOm0z"&gt;Buying and selling used iPhones is a huge market, but it can be scary not knowing if a device will have a low-quality aftermarket&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;battery that might overheat — or annoying if the screen you get has terrible colors because it’s not really OLED (when it should be). This could happen if a repair was performed by a third-party shop that is not in Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838307/apple-iphone-repairs-parts-independent-shops"&gt;independent repair program&lt;/a&gt; (IRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EitIXY"&gt;With the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;Self Service Repair&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, customers will have a means of getting genuine parts and repairing iPhones at home. Since this method of service is supported by Apple, newer iPhones on iOS 15.2 repaired through self-service will acknowledge that a repair was done and the parts are genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeoeUB"&gt;Trading in or reselling iPhones might get more difficult, though — if aftermarket parts were used, then companies and independent buyers now have the leverage to quote lower values if a repair is reported in settings. This can lead to very &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368541/apple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots"&gt;frustrating situations&lt;/a&gt; especially if a phone needs to be sent in for inspection to confirm a trade-in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Jrql"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZGJla"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter could bring universal casting that actually works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSjLQu7b-61QZ8vRbvaiJ56pc5g=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249408/verge_IMG_8670_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This Amazon-led casting standard for TVs could challenge Apple AirPlay and Google Cast &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eU6aaf"&gt;The new smart home standard Matter is making a lot of grand promises, chief among them are fixing the interoperability mess the smart home is currently in and making Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon talk to each other. Big jobs. But it’s also tackling one of the other pain points in the connected home: TV control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm1PBy"&gt;One part of the new connectivity protocol is a specification for televisions and streaming video players. This means that Matter could become yet another way to control content in our homes. But, with its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter’s TV spec has the potential to replace proprietary casting systems, like Apple’s AirPlay or Google’s Cast, and finally free our TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2niZc"&gt;Matter TV, as we’ll call it for wont of an official name, will allow control of a television’s core functions — volume up / down, changing the channel, controlling inputs and outputs, and switching between HDMI ports. “But importantly, you can also do casting,” Chris DeCenzo, Principal Software Development Engineer at Amazon Lab126, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oENWS1"&gt;“This is an area with at least five proprietary protocols today,” he says. “The result is a complete opportunity loss for everyone.” Not to mention major headaches for users as they grapple with which voice assistant can get this content and which remote will control that streaming stick. Amazon is leading the effort to define the specification for Matter — unsurprising, as it is currently the only large player without a proprietary way to cast content from a smartphone to a TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sv-CBjF74efHYHqQaY3CTpNuA3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13262367/jbareham_180726_2773_0087.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controlling our smart TVs can feel anything but smart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1AsPEc"&gt;“Control of media is one of the most popular use cases for Alexa,” says DeCenzo, who told me Amazon is working with the different industry leaders in the fields of smart TVs, streaming video players, and content providers to help them adopt Matter. The goal is so that “customers can have a consistent way to use voice control and to launch their favorite content on those screens,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0NyUx"&gt;While the Matter TV specification doesn’t explicitly call out voice control, the idea here is standardization. One protocol for all device communication, everything will talk to everything else using the same language, no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made it. Ultimately, this means you will be able to use your control interface of choice (a voice assistant, remote control, or smartphone / tablet app) with all your streaming content devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7HxJWF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter could finally free our TVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rguZA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;When Matter arrives in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the Matter TV specification will use app-to-app communication, at least until the TVs and streaming video players become Matter enabled. The spec supports casting from a Matter client (e.g., a remote, a smart speaker, or a phone app) to an app running on a Matter-enabled TV or video player device, explains DeCenzo. It also supports URL-based casting, which means a Matter client can cast to a TV even when there’s no app for that client, if the TV supports Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH, an international standard for streaming) or HLS DRM streams (HLS is a video streaming protocol developed by Apple and widely supported across Android devices and browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tus8PG"&gt;The capability could go beyond just entertainment and be used to enable smart home notifications, says Chris LaPré of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the organization that oversees the new standard. For example, it could cast a message from your connected doorbell to your smart TV, notifying you that someone is at the door. It could potentially show you the video feed, too, something of a workaround for including video feeds in Matter, since cameras are not part of the first device rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ietivWcwo5KkGDZsTA4bL1fY9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074285/f7484de0_fd1a_11eb_8eb4_4d8ac557fa35.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CSA / Matter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matter-enabled devices will have the Matter logo on them to indicate they’re compatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="to2vl9"&gt;Intriguingly, LaPré posited that the specification could allow for the use of context when delivering these messages, such as notifying you from the smart speaker in the room you are in that your laundry is done. “It can be about casting anything, smart home notifications, local video — all it needs is a URL to pull content from,” says LaPré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hntmBy"&gt;The technology here is not system-level specific, as with Apple’s AirPlay. It appears to be more akin to Google’s Cast, where apps will need to build support for it, at least initially. But like AirPlay, and as with all Matter communications, it’s entirely local. Communication from device to device uses Matter as the channel. At launch, Matter will use ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread as its communication protocols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s30Vfu"&gt;The requirement for the app makers — such as Hulu and Netflix, who aren’t currently members of the CSA — to build Matter support could make this something of a non-starter initially. Beyond Amazon and its Prime Video and Google with YouTube, few of the major streaming content providers are part of the CSA, and the app developer will initially need to add Matter support to both the app in the phone or casting device (for example, a smart speaker, laptop, or smartphone) and the app in the receiving device (TV, streaming stick, smart display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCw2XM"&gt;“You can have communication directly from the Prime Video app on my phone to the Prime Video app that’s on the TV,” explains DeCenzo. Going forward, according to LaPré, the streaming video players and TVs will have Matter built into the devices themselves. It seems likely Amazon will enable Matter on its Fire TV devices, and the company has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;committed to upgrading all its smart speakers to support Matter&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung, TCL, Panasonic, and LG are all involved with Matter, as are Apple and Google. However, according to the list of companies on the &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;Matter website&lt;/a&gt;, Vizio, Sony, Toshiba, and Roku are a few notable hardware players that are not yet signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JleYxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a consistent way to use voice control to launch content on any screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcAKqp"&gt;The main goal, however, is part of Matter’s overarching promise: avoiding manufacturer lock-in. People should be able to buy whichever device they choose and it should be able to talk to all the other connected devices in their home, regardless of who made it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqOY9"&gt;For example, if both were Matter-enabled you should be able to control an LG TV from a Samsung smartphone, and that LG TV should be able to receive a message from a Miele smart washer that the laundry is done. But, and this is a big but, nothing in the Matter spec is a requirement. A company that is on board with Matter as a whole is under no obligation to adopt parts of the specification that they don’t need or want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEcMbI"&gt;This means that Apple and Google do not have to adopt the Matter TV specification if they don’t want to. LaPré says both companies have “blessed this” as part of the spec (Matter is governed by members of the CSA who vote on the specifications). Whether they will adopt it remains to be seen. But if Amazon does, which seems like a good bet, it should mean you can use Matter to cast from your Amazon Prime app on your iPhone to your Amazon Prime app on your Apple TV or Google Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1CPHb"&gt;I reached out to both Google and Apple about this specification and how it would impact their current offerings. Both companies have committed to supporting Matter in their respective smart home ecosystems and both are members of the CSA. Kevin Po of Google said in an email that “Google Assistant will support Matter (eg. on/off, play/pause, app launch etc.) at parity with our current Works With Assistant offering.” Apple did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5nr5N9"&gt;Po went on to reiterate that Google Cast remains Google’s preferred method for sending media via apps and voice to Chromecasts, speakers, and displays. As, we can only assume at this stage, will Airplay be Apple’s “preferred method.” But what your preferred method will be could very soon involve a lot more choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKv5qW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block and report text spam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ep8th1m8Qtgf31rfrdgMB5cJzvE=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520154/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Spam.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;No strategy is 100 percent effective, but you can stop much of it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xS9Cl4"&gt;Spam texts can be incredibly irritating — you get a notification and stop what you’re doing to check your phone, only to find somebody is trying to sell you something you don’t want. How can you prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz3VXk"&gt;Unfortunately, there are no absolutes in preventing text spam. But there are some ways you can at least minimize the number of spam texts that get through. Here are some strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kZBYfb"&gt;Do not answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6jYMm1"&gt;Top of the list is — as you probably already know — never reply to a spam text, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; click on a link within a spam text. If you’re not sure whether a text is spam or legitimate, hold off on replying until you’ve done a bit of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="kVNV0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6qez8i"&gt;Use the spam filter on your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rIeftn"&gt;Android phones and iPhones have spam-filtering features that you can enable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NuvT8Q"&gt;If you have an Android phone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aZycxQ"&gt;Open the Messages app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aitn1H"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AcwIN3"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Spam protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qw3pYw"&gt;Make sure “Enable spam protection” is toggled on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LIp4DO"&gt;If you want to see what numbers you’ve marked as spam, you can go to “Spam &amp;amp; blocked” in the initial menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To set up spam blocking, go to “Settings” &amp;amp;gt; “Spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXwdP2ahVxd3OAOhvklYwpyG92s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688826/Screenshot_20210629_115526.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Spam protection. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N95yPCbJSuhETaseeQ-cGaSctgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688921/Screenshot_20210629_115223.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bhbi4Z"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIqKL"&gt;Apple’s spam blocking is a little more basic than Android’s: it blocks phone numbers that you &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;don’t have saved in your contacts list&lt;/a&gt; and haven’t been in contact with before, which could be an issue (say, if you’re expecting a call from a car service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mT9Wfz"&gt;Open the Settings app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cON9RE"&gt;Scroll down to and select Messages &amp;gt; Unknown &amp;amp; Spam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9DWUaL"&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp;amp; Spam.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQ5MN3_pe8P_1cEcmcKEuXpe4ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688833/IMG_DE165A8C72D3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down to Unknown &amp;amp; Spam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54lBOdOA3HP0fjky5doQXJanBug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688834/ios_spam_filter.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OAOftX"&gt;Block specific texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CPlAZi"&gt;When you get a spam text, you can block that individual number from contacting you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CHYvJs"&gt;If you have an Android phone: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iZCr"&gt;When you tap on a message that Android tags as suspicious, the OS will often give you the opportunity to report it as spam (or verify that it’s not spam). But if you get a spam text that wasn’t flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YMRXxv"&gt;Tap the three dots in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gj3lEy"&gt;Select Details &amp;gt; Block &amp;amp; report spam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNHf6y"&gt;You can just block that number if you want, or you can check “Report spam” to send the number to Google and possibly your carrier as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7myw"&gt;Note that this process can differ depending on which Android phone you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android often gives you the chance to report spam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9JTEBdcapOnyMcpc-0VoQVCoi4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688787/Screenshot_20210629_114432__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android often gives you the chance to report spam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can just block a spam text, or you can report it to Google." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_t3PKQ43dotIaSJBmoDsb5TSrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689083/Screenshot_20210629_103221__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can just block a spam text, or you can report it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EdU9wB"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x3Rtt"&gt;Open the spam text and select the user icon on top of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BjzvjY"&gt;Tap on the “info” icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pWO3eN"&gt;Select “Block this Caller”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “info” and then click “info” again on the next page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbBVda0Q1NfpFBAFWsQOixyVK0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689118/IMG_FEEE7B27517F_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “info” and then click “info” again on the next page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At the bottom of the page, select “Block this Caller.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9plBrvQdpfvsj0mGwCG1R6X9FDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22689119/IMG_ED1CBC48272A_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the bottom of the page, select “Block this Caller.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2JCJ1"&gt;If you want to report an iMessage you received as spam, then look for the “Report Junk” link under the message, tap it, tap “Delete,” and then “Report Junk.” Note that this doesn’t automatically block that phone number; you’ll have to do that separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEFlot"&gt;Forward the text to 7726&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F8kP0O"&gt;If you’re using one of the major carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, or T-Mobile), you can report a spam text by forwarding it to 7726. (This spells “SPAM” on your phone keyboard.) This may also work with other carriers; to find out if it’s possible, check with your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHZUy1"&gt;This isn’t just a US thing, by the way. Ofcom, which regulates the UK’s communications services, &lt;a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/tackling-nuisance-calls-and-messages/spam-texts"&gt;also accepts reports of spam texts&lt;/a&gt; forwarded to 7726.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rxUjrU"&gt;Block spam using your carrier’s services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4EbKlM"&gt;Most major carriers these days offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327304/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android"&gt;spam-blocking services for phone calls&lt;/a&gt;, and these can carry over to texts. Carrier sites will give details about free and for-pay security services offered by &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/security-apps/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;; if you use a different carrier, check its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AbbBTq"&gt;Use a third-party spam-blocking service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cz49nD"&gt;If you’re really frustrated and the above strategies aren’t working for you, you can try using a third-party anti-spam service. These are not free. For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.robokiller.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboKiller&lt;/a&gt; costs $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year after a seven-day trial, while &lt;a href="https://nomorobo.com/"&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; costs $1.99 per month per device after a 14-day trial. If you do decide you need a third-party service, you can use the trial to see if it works for you before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder makes it easier to see if you vibe with someone’s Spotify taste</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E63rjMA6pnz0LDvBELqwbAAUzC4=/0x36:1480x1023/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249195/Music_Mode.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iNAMeE"&gt;Tinder is expanding the ways you can judge a potential match by their musical tastes by introducing a Music Mode, which lets you actually hear the song someone’s set as their “Anthem” before you choose which direction to swipe. Music Mode will integrate with Spotify, like Tinder’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/20/12948514/tinder-spotify-integration-show-top-tracks-anthem"&gt;other music features&lt;/a&gt;, but should make it easier to judge someone by the song they’ve picked to represent themselves — even if you’ve never heard it before, you’ll immediately be able to tell the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiENCC"&gt;Music Mode will live in the app’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/"&gt;recently added Explore tab&lt;/a&gt;, which means you can ignore it if you don’t feel like listening to people’s jams right now. Tinder’s product VP Kyle Miller likened Music Mode to “that feeling when you’re at a party and you find out someone else loves the same songs you do.” Something I’ve heard is great but have never gotten to experience thanks to the fact that I exclusively listen to hyperpop shoegaze.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBstC9Sbnc8LtabSrK3jUxp7ZNg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073878/Music_Mode___Sizzle_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music Mode will let you hear a potential match’s Anthem as you swipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PG5WbP"&gt;It’s nice to see Tinder finally building on its Anthem feature, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/20/12948514/tinder-spotify-integration-show-top-tracks-anthem"&gt;it introduced in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and lets you pick a song to feature on your profile and define yourself with. With that said, it’d be nice if the app also integrated with Apple Music — you &lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003358686-I-don-t-have-a-Spotify-account-Can-I-still-add-music-to-my-profile-"&gt;can choose an Anthem without linking a Spotify account&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be able to have your top artists automatically added to your profile like Spotify users can. (Us Apple Music users are already used to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcNo07Xp8aQ"&gt;dancing on our own&lt;/a&gt;, being left out of things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"&gt;like the Spotify Wrapped hype&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPak3"&gt;The dating app also released some statistics on what music people were setting as their Anthems for 2021 — topping it is Drake’s “Way 2 Sexy (with Future &amp;amp; Young Thug),” followed by Doja Cat and SZA’s “Kiss Me More” and Olivia Rodrigo’s “good 4 u.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpDw58"&gt;Personally, I feel like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5mtclwloEQ"&gt;the original “I’m Too Sexy”&lt;/a&gt; would be much more attention-grabbing than Drake’s spin on it, but you do you. Hopefully, though, Tinder will be able to do some sort of sorting for Music Mode so you don’t end up hearing the same song over and over if everyone is using it as their Anthem. The company says Music Mode should become available everywhere you can get Spotify in the coming weeks, and that you’ll be able to use it if you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003357846-Connecting-Spotify-to-your-Tinder-profile"&gt;linked your Spotify account&lt;/a&gt; and added an Anthem of your own. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kobo’s Elipsa and Sage e-readers are better for reading than writing</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t throw out your pen and paper yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="KrjVVj"&gt;E Ink displays, with their ultra crisp resolutions and black and white limitations, have been a natural fit for replacing pen and paper for years. It’s no wonder that the most common uses of the display technology in consumer technology has been for e-readers and digital paper, attempts to try to slash through paper’s thousand-year hegemony as a dominant technology for writing down information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDD8Qw"&gt;This year, Kobo took the logical step and combined the two with the massive, document-sized 10.3-inch $399.99 Elipsa and its new flagship $259.99 Sage e-reader. On paper, it’s a great idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i20VPO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10909837"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pfY03t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10909844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G48l20"&gt;Kobo is by no means the first major company to offer an E Ink-based writing device: Sony has produced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/10/15242238/sony-dpt-rp1-giant-digital-paper-tablet-notebook"&gt;digital paper tablets for years&lt;/a&gt;, and reMarkable is already on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review"&gt;second-generation writing-focused device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwP3bE"&gt;But both Sony and reMarkable’s tablets, which theoretically supporting ebooks, lacked the storefronts and existing customer buy-in to really succeed as a viable e-reader, where the only way to get books was to sideload whatever DRM-free ebooks you already had. The two new Kobo tablets, on the other hand, propose the best of both worlds, combining Kobo’s robust book storefront and library lending support with the paper-ending prowess of an E Ink stylus system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvgW7O"&gt;Neither device quite hits the balance, though. The smaller Sage is better to read with, with physical turn buttons, waterproofing (although the stylus is not), and adjustable color temperature for more natural lighting. But the eight-inch display is awkwardly sized, leaving the device too big to fit into any pants pocket (although it does fit into a jacket pocket), while at the same time being a bit too cramped to comfortably write on, especially if you’re looking at a full, letter-sized document. And unlike the Elipsa, it doesn’t include a stylus in its $259.99 price, instead charging an extra $40 for the privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fTQI18GIjZv9gJkIgSVlVDkWCgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070752/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kobo Sage excels as an e-reader, although the display is a bit cramped for writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zfhpdq"&gt;The Elipsa suffers from the opposite problem: its bigger display lends itself more naturally to using it as a digital paper tablet for annotating PDFs and scribbling notes in a notepad, but it’s more awkward to read on due to the unwieldy size. It’s a great option for things like digital textbooks, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlM2Vy"&gt;Unlike its smaller cousin, the Elipsa isn’t waterproof, and the display eschews the adjustable color temperature feature on the Sage, too. (I’d also beg Kobo to rethink the placement of the power button on a future model — the current location, on the “right” side of the tablet, makes it all but impossible to use when holding it in your right hand.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvO7H2"&gt;In short, the better the device is for reading books, the worse it becomes for using as an E Ink notebook and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJPbJsULoETebi-8pAA8T9kKBzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070751/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The larger Elipsa is well suited for sketching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3DGTUr"&gt;And while Kobo’s handle on e-reader software and technology is competitive, the digital paper aspects of its hardware feel distinctly first generation on both devices. Kobo’s choice to include an extra screen layer for its backlight means that the writing isn’t quite as responsive or tactile feeling as the reMarkable 2. Nor does Kobo have the textured, almost scratchy tactile surface that made the reMarkable so nice to write on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLD5BX"&gt;The software also has some odd quirks, too. One of the more interesting capabilities of Kobo’s devices is the fact that you can write on books — annotating, underlining, highlighting, and otherwise scribbling over or around whatever you’re reading. If you’re the kind of person who likes being able to do that sort of thing, it’s a useful feature once you’ve already got the stylus support (and unlike drawing on a paper book, it’s easily erased). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xQR1a"&gt;Oddly, there’s no easy way to toggle annotations on and off, short of changing the margins or font size. Since annotations are tied to a specific page layout, changing display settings makes your scribbles disappear, replaced by an icon in the margins that makes it easy to revert back to the original (annotated) settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHrQNsqTK4cz1DFRhUxIFcu9J9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070754/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kobo Stylus is included with the Elipsa but sold as a $40 add-on for the Sage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pK66IDgkSZlZPntvFIr3D3lWajM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070756/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both e-readers have landscape support, but it’s awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmrTvR"&gt;There are also some awkward limitations: while you can scribble on Kobo-purchased books to your heart’s content, you can’t share those annotated books or pages. DRMed PDFs can’t be annotated at all, which might limit your ability to take notes on digital textbooks, and library books borrowed from Overdrive will lose their notes once you return them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="he6jxr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kobo’s software oddities linger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WrxzAi"&gt;Kobo’s software oddities linger throughout the device. Both devices, for instance, support landscape layouts for ebooks but not on any of the menus. And the software is badly in need of a smartphone-style control tray for adjusting brightness and basic settings: right now, in the notebook mode, the only way to control brightness is through a poorly advertised swiping gesture, rather than through any software menu. And the Sage doesn’t even offer an option to get to your notebooks from its homescreen, hiding the feature away in a secondary menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMZuux"&gt;The company is also still largely resting on its laurels when it comes to things like Pocket and Overdrive integration, which, while better than Amazon’s non-implementation of the two features, still could be a lot more user-friendly than they are. Kobo, presumably, is just fine with customers buying books from its store rather than taking them out from their local libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdfGuaaCC8pVTpNmsMXs7rHA7XA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070753/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sage’s display can adjust its color temperature; the Elipsa cannot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="INiODr"&gt;The key thing to understand about Kobo’s two new tablets, though, is what you’re getting into before you buy. The Sage, despite having stylus support, is still an e-reader first; and while the digital paper features are a nice bonus, I wouldn’t buy one to use as a digital notebook. And while the Elipsa is an interesting digital paper device made better by Kobo’s ebook infrastructure, it’s still a first-generation piece of hardware that’s outclassed as a writing tablet by the reMarkable 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vVesbn"&gt;Still, even if neither of the two devices hits the sweet spot of a perfect paper replacement, the fact that Kobo is looking to expand its feature set outside of simply buying ebooks is an encouraging one. Hopefully, it will continue to help push the industry forward into taking full advantage of the unique displays that devices like the Kobo Sage and Elipsa offer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU proposals could give millions of gig workers employment rights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Wcrbbi8XUQoWtjv_DfiGsdoq9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249043/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WnCQnU"&gt;The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has put forward a series of proposals that could lead to millions of gig workers across the bloc getting similar legal protections to traditional employees. In a &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6605"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Commission says these rights would include a minimum wage (where applicable), collective bargaining, paid leave, unemployment and sickness benefits, and pensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMyAGO"&gt;The Commission says an estimated 28 million people in the EU currently work through “digital labor platforms,” and of these, as many as 5.5 million may be incorrectly classified as being self-employed. So, with its new rules, the EU wants to lay out a series of criteria that will clearly determine whether a platform is a simple intermediary or an “employer” with more obligations to its “workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8AZM8Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Uber are expected to lobby against the rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2PRq8s"&gt;The legal status of gig workers has become an increasingly contentious issue around the world. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/technology/gig-workers-europe-uber.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that taxi companies like Uber and food delivery services like Deliveroo have been accused of categorizing their workers as independent contractors to save costs and reduce legal liabilities. If adopted, the EU’s new gig economy rules could be some of the strictest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBhSm7"&gt;Individual countries have already attempted to push back on these categorizations. A legal ruling in the UK in February stated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/21330906/uber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights"&gt;Uber’s drivers are workers&lt;/a&gt;, and the following month the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;company started offering a minimum wage and paid vacation&lt;/a&gt;. Uber opposes the Commission’s new proposal, telling the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll result in higher costs for customers, putting jobs at risk. (Though, for what it’s worth, the company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-fares-double-small-cities-if-voters-reject-prop-22-2020-10#:~:text=%22The%20vast%20majority%20of%20our,on%20what%20city%20you%20are.%22"&gt;made the same argument when California&lt;/a&gt; was debating the issue of worker protections. When the company got its way, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike"&gt;raised prices anyway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDys6M"&gt;Alongside its new proposals around employment status, the Commission also wants to increase transparency around the management of employees via algorithm, including the right for workers to contest automated decisions. The proposals also include new obligations for platforms to provide data to national authorities, as well as guidelines clarifying the rights of self-employed people to collective bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sH6xjx"&gt;“Our proposal for a Directive will help false self-employed working for platforms to correctly determine their employment status and enjoy all the social rights that come with that,” the EU’s Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said. “Genuine self-employed on platforms will be protected through enhanced legal certainty on their status and there will be new safeguards against the pitfalls of algorithmic management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPNgug"&gt;The Commission’s proposals will now be debated by the European Parliament and Council. The directive would then need to be adopted into law by individual member states. Given the timescales involved in both these processes, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that the rules are unlikely to become law before 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Winning the war on ransomware</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The DOJ’s task force is changing the landscape around hackers, but will it be enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7G6qma"&gt;In the past 10 years, ransomware has become inescapable. All kinds of institutions have been targeted, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667637/go-read-this-ransomware-attacks-schools-student-identity-theft"&gt;schools children go to&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776561/hosptial-cyberattack-ransomware-risk"&gt;medical infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;report from the US Treasury estimates&lt;/a&gt; there were over half a billion dollars in ransomware payouts in the first half of 2021 alone. Law enforcement has struggled to get a handle on the situation, with many groups operating for years with no apparent fear of repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99EgLA"&gt;This year, federal law enforcement decided to try something new. In April, the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-targeted-by-new-justice-department-task-force-11619014158"&gt;created the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force&lt;/a&gt; in a move to prioritize the “disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity.” The task force is supposed to help share information between DOJ departments, as well as work with outside and foreign agencies. In the months since, it’s made some impressive prosecutions, but they’re just a sliver of the overall  — and the bigger picture remains maddeningly unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="G0OW9I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ttj2fT"&gt;One of the first publicized wins for the group came in June, when the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization"&gt;Department of Justice said&lt;/a&gt; the group was handling the case of an individual alleged to be partially responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/trickbot-not-your-average-hat-trick-a-malware-with-multiple-hats/"&gt;the malware suite known as Trickbot&lt;/a&gt;, which could help expose a system to a ransomware attack. Days after that announcement came an even bigger win: &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside"&gt;the DOJ announced&lt;/a&gt; it had seized back $2.3 million of the $4.4 million ransom paid by oil company Colonial Pipeline, and that the task force had coordinated the efforts. Then, in October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770701/revil-ransomware-arrest-kaseya-crypto-europol-cybersecurity"&gt;its biggest win yet&lt;/a&gt; — the arrests of a few alleged members of REvil, a hacking group, by European police forces, and the seizure of over $6 million in funds the department says were linked to ransomware payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQkPo7"&gt;Still, the sheer volume of attacks means a handful of prosecutions is unlikely to make a difference. Prosecutors need the threat of law enforcement action to scare criminals away from ransomware — and some experts say the scheme is still too lucrative for criminals to give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BREgzz"&gt;Hackers “prefer to take the risk instead of leaving this lucrative malicious activity behind,” according to Dmitry Bestuzhev, a researcher at cybersecurity company Kaspersky. “So what they try to do is to learn from others’ mistakes and improve their opsec, but there is no evidence they feel intimidated and want to quit.” Bestuzhev says they’ll continue to re-form groups, even as the government works to shut them down — “even with the successful arrest we have recently witnessed, many ransomware groups are just here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKEDHx"&gt;But not everyone agrees with Bestuzhev. John Fokker, the head of cyber investigations for McAfee Enterprise Advanced Threat Research, is more optimistic that the task force is starting to change the outlook for criminals. For years ransomware “had been relatively untouched,” not getting too much attention from governments, Fokker told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Now that the task force was starting to crack down, he says, “what used to be a safe space isn’t a safe space anymore. There’s beginning to be an atmosphere of distrust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="kBBYxO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s beginning to be an atmosphere of distrust”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgNZD9"&gt;The attention from the task force has also been affecting ransomware groups’ ability to advertise to potential customers, the ones who often use their malware to infect targets. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com%2Fblogs%2Fenterprise%2Fmcafee-enterprise-atr%2Fwho-will-bend-the-knee-in-raas-game-of-thrones-in-2022%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22822884%2Fus-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a blog&lt;/a&gt;, Fokker discussed how cybercrime forums have become hesitant to play host to ransomware operators, banning them from advertising in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline attacks. Forum administrators, when they offered an explanation for the decision, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/three-major-hacking-forums-ban-ransomware-ads-as-some-ransomware-gangs-shut-down/"&gt;said that ransomware was attracting a lot of unwanted attention&lt;/a&gt; — as one admin put it, according to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;, the word “ransom” was now associated with “unpleasant phenomena — geopolitics, extortion, government hacking.” Another forum had a cheekier explanation for why it was banning posts about ransomware: “if it ran somewhere, then you should probably go catch it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRg7Jy"&gt;The ability to advertise on forums cut off the groups’ easy access to customers, made it harder for ransomware creators to get in touch with the affiliates making them billions of dollars, and made the contact that does happen riskier on both sides. Transferring money or giving demos becomes harder when there’s not a (somewhat) trusted third-party platform to help mediate. That, along with bounties for up to $10 million, has started to create “little cracks in the model,” says Fokker. He even mentioned an instance where an affiliate, angry with what they considered to be a meager payout, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/angry-conti-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-gangs-attack-playbook/"&gt;posted a ransomware group’s entire playbook&lt;/a&gt;. “That kind of environment hurts business,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hFl5IC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re taking the fight to the bad guys”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDWaWh"&gt;The task force has also been helping the people on the other side of ransomware: the companies and organizations that are targeted by it. Government agencies have been working together to keep industries informed about what actions they’ve taken against ransomware operators, and to issue guidance to help keep companies safe. ”The Department of Commerce, Department of Treasury, State, Homeland Security, and Defense, all of them have taken a very clear, concrete action on ransomware actors to disrupt and each of them have their own press release and their own guidance,” says Vishaal Hariprasad, CEO of cyber-focused insurance company Resilience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiU4DH"&gt;When asked to grade the government’s actions, he says, “I would actually give the government an A for what they’ve done in the past 90 days. I think it’s been pretty incredible to see that we’re actually taking action, we’re taking the fight to the bad guys with disruption, with arrests, with warrants, sanctions, the $10 million bounty for any information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6hY3p"&gt;Hariprasad says while the government had carried out similar actions in years prior, the publicity was a boon to victims. “I think the task force has helped coordinate it, but coordinating in the back end where nobody can see isn’t valuable. It doesn’t have the motivating psychological impact unless you can talk about it ... the government’s always been doing things, it’s just never been able to publicly talk about it in a clear and concise, coordinated way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dDdpeB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A big part of deterrence is making sure they understand that there are repercussions to their actions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I40BhI"&gt;Still others are optimistic that the task force can have an impact if it keeps up its legal actions. “As long as there is a sustained effort against these somewhat decentralized and shifting crime gangs; this isn’t just ‘whack-a-mole,’” says Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky, echoing Fokker’s optimism. “While we are seeing the resurrection of certain parts of the ransomware-as-a-service chain in response,” Baumgartner thinks the “coordinated anti-ransomware efforts are just the start. It is great to see evidence of some ransom payments clawed back, decryption keys obtained, communications infiltrated, successful multi-national law enforcement efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXie3u"&gt;In particular, Hariprasad thinks massively disruptive attacks could become less frequent. “I think you’ll still have the one or two major coordinated campaigns that will be very sophisticated,” he says. “But as they get a lot of attention and people start focusing on them, you’ll see that happen less, and the younger or the less sophisticated operators will continue to get back to the lower end of the ransoms and just kind of go for quantity over quality.” Better to collect a few $50,000 ransoms without making headlines, the thinking goes, than to bag $40 million and have law enforcement kicking down your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLFKry"&gt;It’s hard to say which of the task force’s tactics will end up having the greatest effect, and there’s always the possibility that things get worse before they get better. If ransomware operators wind up desperate, they could end up going after a massive target, in a Hollywood-style “one last job” scenario. Ransomware could also become a more manageable annoyance, as hackers look for the next big cash cow, one that the world’s governments aren’t paying as much attention to. Or attackers could get creative and start developing entirely new ways to make trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BDPV0d"&gt;Cybersecurity is always a cat-and-mouse game, and the incentives to hack big companies won’t be going away — but as Hariprasad told me, “a big part of deterrence is making sure they understand that there are repercussions to their actions and that the government is actively doing something.” On that point, at least, governments seem to be making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
