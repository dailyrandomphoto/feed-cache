    <title>Mark Zuckerberg has been added to a DC lawsuit over the Cambridge Analytica scandal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TGUk7"&gt;District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine is adding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18148651/facebook-lawsuit-washington-dc-attorney-general-lawsuit"&gt;to a lawsuit over&lt;/a&gt; the Cambridge Analytica data-mining scandal. Racine &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/agkarlracine/status/1450787572112838658?s=21"&gt;announced the addition&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter this morning, saying his investigation had revealed that Zuckerberg was “personally involved in decisions related to Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s failure to protect user data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wQhKX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/Facebook-Complaint.pdf"&gt;2018 lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; accuses Facebook (and now Zuckerberg) of misrepresenting its policies around third-party data access and compromising user privacy with lax protections. The attorney general’s office alleges that Facebook violated the Consumer Protection Procedures Act and seeks civil damages for the offense. A judge &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy/u-s-judge-waves-through-d-c-case-against-facebook-idUSKCN1T22X7"&gt;allowed the case to proceed&lt;/a&gt; despite Facebook’s efforts to halt it in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3TLtwg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: I just added Mark Zuckerberg as a defendant in my lawsuit against Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our continuing investigation revealed that he was personally involved in decisions related to Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s failure to protect user data.&lt;/p&gt;— AG Karl A. Racine (@AGKarlRacine) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AGKarlRacine/status/1450787572112838658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhku4Z"&gt;Racine says he added Zuckerberg after the office reviewed “hundreds of thousands of pages of documents produced in litigation and completed a wide range of depositions including former employees and whistleblowers.” He did not indicate which details had led to the decision or how deeply Zuckerberg was allegedly involved in the incident. “We’ve taken our obligation to investigate wrongdoing very seriously — and Facebook should take its responsibility to protect users just as seriously,” Racine tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2YowU"&gt;The DC complaint focuses primarily on Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm that worked with a researcher using Facebook’s developer platform to access over 70 million US users’ profile information with the goal of targeting political advertisements. It alleges that Facebook knew the system was being abused to harvest data from nonconsenting users but failed to conduct audits, limit the company’s access, or reveal the improper access publicly until years after the fact. The complaint claims Facebook also failed to take action when other companies violated its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJhXxs"&gt;Facebook has disputed the basis of the lawsuit. “These allegations are as meritless today as they were more than three years ago, when the District filed its complaint. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously and focus on the facts,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="58ef41"&gt;Microsoft and Adidas revealed a slick-looking pair of limited-edition Xbox sneakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712418/adidas-xbox-sneakers-trainers-microsoft"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate Xbox’s 20th anniversary, and now, we know what you need to do to actually try to win a pair for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="W4ratj"&gt;The cool shoes are just one piece of Microsoft’s 20th anniversary celebration for Xbox.

This year also marks the 20th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, which launched with the original Xbox, and Microsoft is recognizing that milestone with a special &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Xbox Series X console&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will start downranking your Groups posts if you break its rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SarFA2O5ZvHbBDqoQroJQbxk2J8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70021125/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0708stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cz2b06"&gt;Facebook will start demoting all Groups content from people who have violated its policies elsewhere across the platform. The move is supposed to limit rulebreakers from reaching other people in a community, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335659/facebook-groups-members-rules-recommendations-ban"&gt;builds on existing policies&lt;/a&gt; that prevent them from posting, commenting, or inviting others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cN4Yyb"&gt;In a blog post, Facebook says it will also add a new “Flagged by Facebook” feature that shows group administrators content that’s been flagged for removal. The admins can choose to remove the content or to ask for a review if they believe it’s appropriate, with the goal of getting administrators involved before Facebook steps in and issues a strike that could affect the group itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JghvG"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554349/facebook-groups-probation-violating-rules-misinformation-election"&gt;paid increasing attention to groups&lt;/a&gt; since the 2020 US presidential election, where they were used to spread false information about voting. It’s also facing increased scrutiny over extremism and other harmful content on the platform thanks to documents leaked by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, who recently testified before Congress. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xjjj/facebook-says-extremely-common-thing-it-does-is-bad-when-reporters-do-it"&gt;Facebook indicated that&lt;/a&gt; it’s also expecting a slew of new stories based on “thousands of pages of leaked documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOJchW"&gt;While the company characterized the upcoming reports as “an orchestrated ‘gotcha’ campaign,” it’s also promoted its efforts to reduce hateful or false content while offering greater transparency around moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688840/facebook-releases-content-distribution-guidelines-for-news-feed"&gt;A September update&lt;/a&gt; offered detail about content that it demoted as problematic but didn’t entirely remove, including posts by accounts that had violated its rules in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft now lets you test Android apps on Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_dcNh5k3RqBO-bRHddFMBSX5tI=/0x0:2116x1411/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70021012/androidapps.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="270DWK"&gt;Microsoft is now allowing Windows 11 testers to try out Android apps. A preview version of the Windows Subsystem for Android will be available to beta testers of Windows 11 today, providing access to apps from the Amazon Appstore. Testers with Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm processors will all be able to try out Android apps on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjPko9"&gt;Apps can be loaded through the Microsoft Store, which will list a variety of apps that then point toward the Amazon Appstore to load and install. Android apps can run side by side with other Windows apps, and they’re also integrated into Alt + Tab and Task view, and you can pin them to the Start menu or the taskbar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bpf-qXXYuIUAauSj5bO6Z4Xq3Tk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942029/Collection.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps are available in the Microsoft Store on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Vpsmnv"&gt;“You can see notifications from Android apps notifications in the Action Center or share your clipboard between a Windows app and an Android app,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/20/introducing-android-apps-on-windows-11-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;explains Android on Windows 11 team&lt;/a&gt;. “We have built the experience with accessibility in mind; many Windows accessibility settings apply to Android apps and we are working with Amazon to deliver more improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykqOCE"&gt;Microsoft has partnered with Amazon to curate 50 apps for Windows Insiders to test on Windows 11. These include mobile games like &lt;em&gt;Lords Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;June’s Journey&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Coin Master. &lt;/em&gt;There are also reading apps like Kindle, and kids apps like Lego Duplo World or Khan Academy Kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt1On3"&gt;Fifty apps is a tiny selection of the more than 3 million apps available on the Google Play Store, and even the more than 600,000 on Amazon’s Appstore. It’s not clear how many Android apps will be available once this feature is broadly launched for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7cBX8N7MI7jVNQGXMtBlUwnkz8o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942022/Pic2_Latte_WSL2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps running on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wSohzX"&gt;Microsoft has built a subsystem in Windows 11 to enable Android app support. It includes the Linux kernel and an Android OS based on Android Open Source Project (AOSP) version 11. “The Subsystem runs in a Hyper-V Virtual Machine, like the Windows Subsystem for Linux,” says Microsoft’s Android apps on Windows 11 team. “It understands how to map the runtime and APIs of apps in the AOSP environment to the Windows graphic layer, the memory buffers, the input modes, the physical and virtual devices, and the sensors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlzSHp"&gt;This subsystem supports AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm chips, and Microsoft has partnered with Intel to enable Arm-only apps to run on AMD and Intel devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pg84dy"&gt;Microsoft is only enabling Android apps in the Beta Channel of Windows 11 today, and the company says it plans to bring the preview to Dev Channel users “&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/20/announcing-android-apps-on-windows-11-preview-for-windows-insiders-in-the-beta-channel/"&gt;down the road&lt;/a&gt;.” Your Windows 11 PC will need to be set to the US region, in the Beta Channel, and it also requires a US-based Amazon account to access the Amazon Appstore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt Red delays next-gen Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_61RFRc_EhvxrJg13czKDwfdi8=/105x0:1725x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020999/Cyberpunk2077_Always_bring_a_gun_to_a_knife_fight_RGB_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VsXvdd"&gt;In September, CD Projekt Red said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22649551/cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-next-gen-ps5-xbox-series-upgrade-update-release-announcement"&gt;targeting late 2021 release dates&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s&lt;/em&gt; next-gen upgrades, but on Wednesday, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1450845753996455944"&gt;announced those won’t be hitting this year&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the plan is for the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; to release in the first quarter of 2022, while the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled for a release in the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZMdxmZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT PRODUCTION UPDATE &lt;a href="https://t.co/KOnaIVOt4v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KOnaIVOt4v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED (@CDPROJEKTRED) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1450845753996455944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jnlnfX"&gt;With the delays, it seems like CD Projekt Red is taking steps to ensure it doesn’t repeat the botched launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;riddled with bugs and issues&lt;/a&gt; when it was first released in December of 2020. The studio has spent the months since releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627096/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-3-reset-perks-mini-map"&gt;numerous patches&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268382/cyberpunk-2077-1-12-new-hotfix-patch-mods-vulnerability-security"&gt;and hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to address some of the problems. I haven’t spent much time with &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; since I finished it earlier this year, but I’m looking forward to exploring Night City again once the next-gen upgrade arrives in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is officially bringing God of War to PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Q-uHKJoqQEtyRtqdPy4Xqmiifc=/108x0:3348x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020903/51607419349_561abb90d9_o.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZQqiHp"&gt;One of Sony’s best PlayStation games, &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, is headed to PC. The game will be available on January 14th, 2022, and you can preorder it now on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593500/God_of_War/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/god-of-war"&gt;Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt; for $49.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqcFiL"&gt;If you opt to pick up the game on PC, you’ll be able to play it at 4K and unlocked frame rates, as well as in a 21:9 ultra widescreen aspect ratio (assuming you have the right hardware to support those features). The game will also support Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and its Reflex low-latency technology for “a more responsive experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="xdgANL"&gt;Sony promises that the game will have “robust controller support and keyboard mapping customization,” and you can of course use Sony’s DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers if you prefer. You can read more about the &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/20/god-of-war-2018-is-coming-to-pc/"&gt;upcoming PC port on Sony’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (which also mentions just how huge &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; has been on PS4: the game has sold 19.5 million copies as of August).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7qgXc"&gt;Sony has slowly been bringing some of its biggest PlayStation hits to PC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/3/21312588/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-august-7-features-sony"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297091/days-gone-pc-playstation-games-ports-jim-ryan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And in addition to &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, Sony is also planning to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which remasters both &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: The Lost Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, though that currently has an unspecific early 2022 release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1NhA4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 11:44AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added sales data for &lt;/em&gt;God of War&lt;em&gt; on PS4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The mission to break barriers to space travel for people with disabilities</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UsuSrSNywDbNEHMexVipRWtiEYM=/0x0:5500x3667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020835/20211017_LBC_ZG574_AstroAccess_610.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qk8zKK"&gt;When Sina Bahram shifted into weightlessness for the first time on Sunday, he could feel the air brushing past his skin as his body began to float into the air. As someone who’d longed to be an astronaut since he was four years old, he’d been waiting many years to have this exact feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbtoV5"&gt;“I knew it would be a joyous experience just because I looked forward to it for many decades of my life, but the visceral nature of that joy wasn’t brought home until you actually experience it,” &lt;a href="https://www.sinabahram.com/"&gt;Bahram&lt;/a&gt;, a computer scientist who runs Prime Access Consulting, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is truly indescribable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQEgEc"&gt;Bahram got to perceive free fall for the first time onboard a specially outfitted plane operated by the Zero-G Corporation, a company that provides parabolic flights that mimic the feeling of being weightless in space. He experienced the moment using his senses of touch, sound, smell, and taste — but not sight. Bahram has been legally blind for most of his life, something that effectively bars him from flying to space with NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wpQTiC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew it would be a joyous experience just because I looked forward to it for many decades of my life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AJcTi"&gt;But now, having experienced weightlessness himself, he’s more confident than ever that his disability should not be a barrier to space travel. “Even when you’re feeling completely out of control because everything you know about the world from your entire lifespan is no longer true, in terms of gravity — down being down; up being up — even with all of those removed, there was never a sense of uncertainty or danger,” says Bahram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmgoqF"&gt;Bahram was one of 12 people with a disability to experience weightlessness on Sunday, October 17th, during a parabolic flight, which took off from Long Beach, California. It was the first flight of its kind, &lt;a href="https://astroaccess.org/"&gt;arranged by a non-profit called Mission: AstroAccess&lt;/a&gt;, which has the stated goal of flying one or more of these flyers — called ambassadors — to space in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gsrPG3VsQR5y4NQVRmH5Mt_36Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941854/Headshot_SinaBahram.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sina Bahram, one of the 12 ambassadors on the Mission: AstroAccess flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BGANrs"&gt;It’s a goal that would certainly &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-time-to-rethink-whos-best-suited-for-space-travel/"&gt;shake up the current model for who is allowed to fly to space&lt;/a&gt;. To become a NASA astronaut, for instance, a candidate must be in excellent health and has to undergo a stringent physical to be considered for the program. NASA astronauts used to need 20/20 vision, though the space agency now allows individuals who wear glasses or who have had surgical procedures to correct their vision to 20/20. But NASA will not consider individuals who are blind, and any other major medical disabilities related to deafness or mobility will automatically disqualify someone from the application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJMJRW"&gt;However, human spaceflight is in the midst of a major transformation. For one thing, it’s not just NASA’s game anymore. Numerous private companies have sprung up in the last few decades aiming to send humans to various parts of space. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin have both developed suborbital vehicles that are designed to take paying customers to the edge of space and back so that flyers can experience a brief glimpse of Earth from above. Meanwhile, SpaceX has started flying people to low Earth orbit on its new Crew Dragon spacecraft. While the company built the vehicle primarily to carry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX recently flew a crew of four civilians to orbit&lt;/a&gt; on the vehicle during a private three-day mission. One of those passengers, Hayley Arceneaux, had an internal prosthesis in her leg — something that would have disqualified her from flying as a NASA astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="F8dJNb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;human spaceflight is in the midst of a major transformation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fVxBsv"&gt;Recently, the European Space Agency announced plans to select an astronaut with a physical disability &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Careers_at_ESA/ESA_Astronaut_Selection/Parastronaut_feasibility_project"&gt;through its Parastronaut Feasibility Project&lt;/a&gt;. With more opportunities than ever for non-NASA astronauts to fly to space, Mission: AstroAccess is striving for people with disabilities to be included in future missions — suborbital or orbital. Ultimately, AstroAccess wants to know how the physical space inside a spacecraft might be updated so that people with sight, sound, and mobility disabilities might be able to work and thrive in a space environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QWNyDxt3-izeNFngkA0Iqquf54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941904/AstroAccess_Flight1_Ambassadors_Tarmac.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 12 ambassadors ahead of their flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WrH4uX"&gt;Before that happens, though, AstroAccess wanted to give people with disabilities the opportunity to simply experience weightlessness. A crew of 12 were selected from a pool of applicants from all over the world to fly aboard the Zero-G Corporation’s Boeing 727. The belly of the plane is mostly gutted and padded to provide plenty of room to float around as the pilot steers the vehicle on a series of peaks and valleys to simulate weightlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYY1NN"&gt;Once the crew had been selected, they were grouped into teams. One group, which included Bahram, had people with varying degrees of limited vision. Another group had astronauts with varying levels of deafness. And a third group had those with limited mobility — people who either use prostheses or wheelchairs to move. Together the teams came up with different types of research and experiments they wanted to conduct during the flight. Bahram and his group decided to bring Braile displays to see how they fared in weightlessness, as well as tactile sensors to help determine the direction and orientation of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTXReG"&gt;Not all of their experiments panned out, Azubuike “Zuby” Onwuta, who is also legally blind, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“We brought on certain tools to help us conduct sound experiments, but then the roar of the engine drowned those tools that emitted sound,” said Onwuta, a US Army veteran and disability advocate who trained at Harvard-MIT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRYcw5"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://viktoriamodesta.com/"&gt;Viktoria Modesta&lt;/a&gt;, one of her biggest tasks ahead of the flight was coming up with the designs for the flight suits, which had to be tailored very specifically for each individual. Opting for black material with plenty of zippers and pockets, Modesta made sure each suit was crafted very specifically with each wearer in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YLu5wHNORaaz02EakNQ3pISq9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941778/AstroAccess_Flight1_ViktoriaModesta.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Al Powers for Zero Gravity Corporation&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viktoria Modesta experiencing weightlessness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dfd4ZU"&gt;“A lot of customization was done to people’s flight suits, specifically with openings, pockets, extra straps, and different ways of helping their body function in zero gravity,” Modesta, a singer and performance artist who had her left leg amputated below the knee years after an accident at birth, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Having such highly tailored suits became critical for some of the mobility crew to have the best possible experience. For instance, one of the ambassadors had a suit with special straps that held his legs together, which made it easier to focus on maneuvering through the space. And when some of the mobility crew found themselves floating, it was the first time in years that they could move around without the use of their chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Hndwt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it is our environments that are disabling, not individuals that are disabled”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="19lE2s"&gt;Each experience was different for each ambassador, and now Mission: AstroAccess has plenty of new data to help suggest what kind of accessibility-related changes should be incorporated in future spacecraft. That might include directional fabrics on the walls, for instance, to help those with limited vision determine their orientation. Bahram argues that making these kinds of updates is not just about being inclusive but also about making flights safer for every astronaut. He cited one instance in which astronaut Chris Hadfield went temporarily blind during a spacewalk when cleaning solution squirted into his eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB1mZa"&gt;“That is a failure of the system,” Bahram says. “There is no reason whatsoever that that should have been as dangerous as it was. It was because NASA has not considered persons with disabilities as viable candidates. That could have been a complete non-issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6Dry7"&gt;With more accessible tools, all astronauts — from the able-bodied ones to those with disabilities — might have more options to remain safe during an emergency scenario. And it starts with designing a space with all types of bodies in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dajcgj"&gt;“It’s one of these things where this level of ableism has been built into our society, and we need to understand that it is our environments that are disabling, not individuals that are disabled,” Bahram says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scientists took the first steps toward pig-to-human kidney transplants </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="British Pig Farmers Ask Government To Ease Immigration Rules" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVlA_7ePYSsFG3IhvPFfW_zziug=/64x0:3973x2606/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020647/1346397234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nathan Stirk/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SO01c"&gt;For the first time, surgeons successfully attached a kidney from a genetically modified pig to a human patient — a major scientific breakthrough, and one that could open up a new way to provide organs to sick people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBQ2Lp"&gt;Scientists got the kidney from a pig genetically engineered so that it wouldn’t produce a sugar called alpha-gal, which the human immune system attacks and would trigger the body to reject the organ. Surgeons at NYU attached the organ to a brain-dead patient on a ventilator whose family agreed to the experimental procedure. It was connected outside of her body to blood vessels on her leg, and observed over a period of 54 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDxrVJ"&gt;The recipient’s body didn’t immediately reject the kidney, and the kidney functioned normally for the hours it was attached. “There didn’t seem to be any kind of incompatibility between the pig kidney and the human that would make it not work,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/health/kidney-transplant-pig-human.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;Robert Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; the director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times. &lt;/em&gt;“There wasn’t immediate rejection of the kidney.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RLquT"&gt;There are still many open questions: it’s not clear if the organ would last over an extended period of time inside the body. While the kidney worked for the time it was attached, organ rejection can happen &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000815.htm"&gt;over years&lt;/a&gt; — and can happen even if the donor and the recipient are perfect matches. The details of the procedure haven’t been reviewed or published in a medical journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JtQoS"&gt;Experts are also considering the ethical implications of this type of animal-to-human procedure. Karen Maschke, a research scholar at the Hastings Center, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/20/1047560631/in-a-major-scientific-advance-a-pig-kidney-is-successfully-transplanted-into-a-h"&gt;has a grant&lt;/a&gt; to develop ethics and policy recommendations for clinical trials of these transplants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpxwfp"&gt;But the procedure was still a landmark step &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9529493/pig-transplant-gene-editing"&gt;in efforts&lt;/a&gt; to perform animal-to-human transplants, called xenotransplantation. Animal heart valves have been used in human procedures &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174391911500374X"&gt;for decades&lt;/a&gt;, but those can be chemically treated to kill living cells and prevent rejections. Organs, made of living tissue, are more complicated. Proponents of the efforts envision a steady supply of organs from animals, which could help the thousands of people on waitlists for transplants. They could be a lifeline for the hundreds of thousands of people with kidney failure who rely on dialysis.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tOIHf"&gt;The kidney used in this procedure was produced by the company Revivicor. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its genetically altered pigs for therapeutic uses and for human consumption &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food"&gt;in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. (Some people have an allergy to the alpha-gal sugar, and meat from these pigs might be safe for them to eat.) The FDA would still need to review any medical products — like organs — before they could be used in medicine. The company &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00885-9"&gt;said in April&lt;/a&gt; that it hoped to launch clinical trials using its animal organs for transplants “within the next year or two.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gm8t1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook fined $70 million for withholding information about Giphy acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook : Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfxhRU2EAxJQRt4bX-jrDooRqc4=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020645/1345139017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="taAaCI"&gt;A UK watchdog has fined Facebook £50 million ($70 million USD) for purposely concealing information about its Giphy acquisition (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/facebook-fined-70m-for-flouting-giphy-order-made-by-uk-watchdog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;Facebook began its $400 million acquisition of Giphy&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21260653/facebook-giphy-acquisition-merger-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar-josh-hawley-senate-antitrust"&gt;even members of Congress thought it was a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k40p4y"&gt;The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621957/facebook-giphy-deal-blocked-uk-regulator"&gt;dealings with the massive GIF-making hub were called out by UK regulators&lt;/a&gt; in August, leading the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to launch an antitrust probe. As part of the investigation, the CMA issued an initial enforcement order (IEO) that prohibits any further integration between Facebook and Giphy, which is supposed to allow the companies to continue competing as if there was no acquisition at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rqmEhA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No decision has yet been reached in relation to the merger”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCKEmx"&gt;But according to a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-facebook-over-enforcement-order-breach"&gt;press release from the CMA&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook failed to provide the required updates about its compliance with the IEO, despite receiving several warnings. The CMA says that Facebook breached the IEO by “consciously refusing to report all the required information,” resulting in a $70 million fine. This is in addition to another £500,000 ($700,000) fine that Facebook incurred by swapping its Chief Compliance Officer twice without asking permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsyFtK"&gt;The CMA says that this is the first time it has ever fined a company for such a deliberate violation. “This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law,” says Joel Bamford, the CMA’s senior director of mergers. In the press release, the CMA also notes that its investigation is still ongoing and that “no decision has yet been reached in relation to the merger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdZVIh"&gt;Facebook’s shady behavior, both in the past and present, has given Facebook quite a bit of bad publicity. That’s probably why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to rename the company and vanish into the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI is making a cinema camera with a built-in gimbal and LIDAR focusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjlRVLVKDZL-WPqHSTHPwdC_1Iw=/0x65:2048x1430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70020639/Ronin_4D___Leica_M_mount__diagonal_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9O4ga6"&gt;Drone-maker DJI &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fronin-4d&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced a cinema camera&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a built-in gimbal, can shoot at up to 8K resolution, and uses a LIDAR rangefinder that promises a “sharper, faster, and more reliable focusing experience,” even in low light. It’s called the Ronin 4D, and while it’s aimed squarely at professionals, it’s loaded with interesting features and shows that DJI is continuing to develop its camera tech outside of drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmlC1Z"&gt;The Ronin 4D’s camera is called the Zenmuse X9, and it’s full-frame, has interchangeable lens mounts for DJI’s DL and Leica’s M systems, and includes nine (nine!) built-in ND filters for controlling your exposure in the sun. The 6K model can do 6K at 60fps and 4K120, and the 8K model can do 75fps at its max resolution. The X9 can shoot in RAW or 422HQ flavors of ProRes, or H.264 if you’re trying to keep file sizes in check, or need a fast turnaround for your footage. Until this point, DJI’s Zenmuse cameras have mostly been designed to fly on its drones, but (unfortunately for drone enthusiasts) the company tells me that the X9 is meant specifically for the Ronin 4D. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It seems like a pretty cohesive unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsO6XV"&gt;DJI says that the 6K version of the Ronin 4D will be available in December and that the 8K version will be available “at a later date.” There’s also a ton of accessories coming for it, including a wireless monitoring system (which will also allow for remote control of the camera’s settings and gimbal movements, making the camera operator’s job easier) and a focus motor that will even let you adapt manual-focus lenses to use the LIDAR system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please enjoy this incredible demo image DJI provided. I’m sure the camera operator on the wire appreciates the remote camera controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LIDAR focus system, which has a 10-meter range and can control autofocus or provide a waveform to help with manual focusing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L1IoIO"&gt;As for the built-in gimbal, DJI says it’ll be able to stabilize along four axes (hence the 4D in the name), including up and down. According to the company, this should help further reduce bumps or camera shake from an operator walking or running, which would be impressive — you can get that done with other stabilization tech, but it requires a good deal of skill, as basically any of my Steadicam footage will attest to. DJI says the Ronin 4D is “lighter and smaller than most cinema cameras mounted on a professional three-axis stabilizer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2vaHh"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18290251/dji-osmo-pocket-price-release-date-features-video-camera-photos"&gt;DJI’s Osmo camera / gimbal systems&lt;/a&gt;, or even some of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fronin-sc%3Fsite%3Dbrandsite%26from%3Dnav&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lower-end Ronin gimbals&lt;/a&gt;, the Ronin 4D isn’t aimed at consumers or prosumers. The 6K version costs $7,199, the 8K version is $11,499, and both come with a decent kit: the gimbal, camera, LIDAR range finder, a monitor and hand grips / top handle, a carrying case, and a battery (the 8K camera also comes with a 1TB SSD). In the realm of production cameras and stabilization systems, that’s actually on the lower end (DJI’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1333927-REG%2Fdji_ronin_2_3_axis_stabilizer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cinema-focused Ronin 2 stabilizer&lt;/a&gt; costs over $8,000 without any camera attached, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1506002-REG%2Fsony_pxw_fx9v_pxw_fx9_xdcam_6k_full_frame.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F20%2F22735184%2Fdji-ronin-4d-cinema-camera-gimbal-8k-zenmuse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s FX9 6K camera&lt;/a&gt; costs $11,000 for just the body), but if you were hoping to use the LIDAR focus system to absolutely nail focus in your vlogs, you may want to rethink that. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eo6AeApgg0O8CfQrn0Y2Uj-OLSw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940765/auLYKoow.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: what shooting with the Ronin 4D looks like under more normal conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YzEjOZ"&gt;Despite the professional focus, the Ronin 4D still looks like a really desirable piece of tech. It also makes sense coming from DJI — the company has obviously been putting a lot of work into its drone cameras and gimbal systems, so it was only a matter of time before it put them together. Plus, it’s always possible that a version of the LIDAR system will make its way to DJI’s handheld Osmo cameras, which could make for a very interesting vlogging setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r80Z32"&gt;As for DJI’s hopes of the Ronin 4D being a cinema camera, it’ll be interesting to see what kind of productions pick it up. It definitely seems like it’ll be worth considering for anyone shooting fast-paced footage, like documentary or commercial filmmakers. Whether Hollywood is looking for an all-in-one camera and gimbal versus a piecemeal system that gets you more control is hard to say — though DJI is working on getting &lt;a href="https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000579527-Cameras-and-Image-Capture"&gt;Netflix classification&lt;/a&gt;, so the Ronin 4D should be an option for anyone looking to shoot an original for the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
