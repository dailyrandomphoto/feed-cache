    <title>Oculus has turned on wireless PC streaming for the Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbEyUi-Lzsts5F8-Q47ZCVfDlX8=/781x0:9219x5625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178322/Oculus_Quest_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPmiJh"&gt;Oculus is turning on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382805/oculus-quest-2-facebook-wireless-pc-streaming-120hz-infinite-office"&gt;Air Link PC streaming feature&lt;/a&gt; for the Quest 2 virtual reality headset. Air Link is part of the Oculus v28 software update, which recently started rolling out to Oculus headset owners. Facebook Reality Labs head &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1385654671008620544"&gt;Andrew Bosworth says&lt;/a&gt; you can find the feature if you’re running v28 on your PC and Quest 2 headset; if you haven’t gotten access to the update yet, “it’s coming very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSQ9iR"&gt;Air Link lets Quest 2 owners with a strong Wi-Fi connection play PC VR games wirelessly on their headsets. Air Link was initially disabled on v28. But &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/air-link-launch/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Upload&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, Quest 2 owners had found a way to unofficially turn it on, and Oculus had warned that the experience was “not representative” of the final result. Bosworth says Oculus is releasing the feature today because “the excitement over Air Link can’t be contained”; the release was originally scheduled for next week, so Bosworth’s tweet moves it up by a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="twyoJG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like the excitement over Air Link can’t be contained, so we’re officially making it available today for everyone who has both Quest and PC v28. If you don’t have v28 yet, stay tuned, it’s coming very soon!&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1385654671008620544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOgJlY"&gt;Air Link evolved from Oculus Link, which used a USB-C cable to run PC VR games on the otherwise standalone Oculus Quest line of devices. (Oculus says a cable will still give you the best graphical fidelity, and unlike Air Link, it will charge your headset while you’re playing.) A similar wireless feature was already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;built into &lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party app. Depending on performance, Air Link could make &lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop’s&lt;/em&gt; alternative less appealing to Quest 2 owners. But Oculus isn’t currently bringing the feature to its original Quest headset. Air Link is also classed as an experimental feature. If it’s like the original Link, users can expect some bugs around the launch — but at least that launch is coming a little sooner than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yoda has no time for shoes, but you might for Adidas’ Yoda-themed sneakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3ZWkoD3O14uZUBsO9y-G_0_PEQ=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178303/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_StillLife.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wVTeUJ"&gt;Adidas has designed a pair of Stan Smith sneakers that could be perfect for the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fan in your life who also pulls double-duty as a hypebeast. The Yoda version of the Stan Smith, Forever sneakers features a design inspired by the famous green alien, with quotes and illustrations. Adidas says the shoes will go on sale right after&lt;em&gt; Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Day, on May 5th, for $120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGsRS9"&gt;The Stan Smith, Forever line is named after American tennis player Stan Smith, with “Forever” standing for the shoe’s environmentally friendly bent due to its use of “Primegreen” fabric. Adidas claims Primegreen is made from 50 percent recycled materials. The Yoda version is also green in another way, of course. The back heels of the shoes have Yoda’s face embossed in green fabric, and the tongues of both shoes feature illustrations: on one, Yoda, and on the other, Stan Smith himself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BkbGQH0_6p6QcPmBNMAknLcMVs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465438/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Tongue.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s Yoda, judging you for judging these Yoda sneakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AamVwpPPvha-LIuTurqW_7N9OZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465778/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Heel.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There he is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PHj5kV"&gt;Adidas didn’t exactly dig deep for the quote printed on both shoes: together, they read “Do or do not, there is no try.” But it’s sneaky when you think about it: it’s a way to lift Nike’s famous “Just do it” slogan by using the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gWMXbyemXTIGaRqgoHle_in6F1U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465639/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Side.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iconic and inspiring Yoda quote printed on Adidas’ new sneakers. Note Stan Smith on the tongue as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RR3IRJ"&gt;One sort of odd thing about making a Yoda-themed shoe: Yoda doesn’t wear shoes. In every appearance in the film series or &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;animated television series, Yoda is either barefoot or his cloak covers his feet. The dude is clearly no sneakerhead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GiYyxm7SI6xfPiK8rNcPwFaZ3k8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465583/FiveFamousJediContinueToFailToDetectTheSith_AotC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Wookiepedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoda conducting Jedi Council business, clearly sans-shoes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BThal2"&gt;The same can be said for Yaddle, who — outside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20997564/baby-yoda-disney-plus-star-wars-mandalorian-merchandise-stranger-things-game-of-thrones-streaming"&gt;Grogu / Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt; — is the only other known member of Yoda’s species. She also enjoys her three-toed feet unconstrained.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F7g6gSrYrb5mR338dAjl-SLNcVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465605/YaddleJediCouncil.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Wookiepedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yaddle, besides always looking incredibly chill, also scorns shoes and all they represent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VAGdlk"&gt;Is a distaste for foot coverings something specific to Yoda’s mysterious alien species? Plenty of other nonhuman Jedi wear shoes. Is it perhaps due to Yoda having thick, leathery, Hobbit-like feet? &lt;a href="https://boards.theforce.net/threads/no-shoes.13529531/"&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans hypothesized way back in 2003&lt;/a&gt; that Yoda’s species could have the same resilient soles that J.R.R. Tolkien gifted his hobbits. Feet strong enough to not need shoes. I certainly see how their argument makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6lDP9"&gt;Regardless of the truth, there’s an unspoken tension that comes from Adidas choosing to make shoes based on an alien who clearly despises footwear, and this isn’t the first time it’s done so. Adidas &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/style/adidas-the-mandalorian-sneakers-baby-yoda-superstar-release-info"&gt;also made shoes based on Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt;, a character, you may remember, who spent a large part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with his feet never touching the ground, thanks to a hovering crib. Where does it end, Adidas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWxevO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHAivj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nm4c6w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNC5Ao"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfT9kS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJz6OK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykla2L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sn5zrs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fourth Captain America movie is in the works from the creator of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYOL0etI6PQvoLs-Cc1o--wKE4o=/639x0:3201x1708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178289/OPN0260_105_comp_v099_20201210_r709.1088.147623.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbAOfb"&gt;A fourth &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; movie is on the way, set to be co-written by &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22333905/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-captain-america"&gt;Malcolm Spellman&lt;/a&gt;, the creator, showrunner, and head writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which just aired its season finale on Disney Plus on Friday). Dalan Musson, a staff writer on the series, will also co-write the upcoming film, according to reports from &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/captain-america-4-in-the-works-with-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-showrunner-malcolm-spellman-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/captain-america-4-in-development-with-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-ep-malcolm-spellman-writing-1234742675/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EM8p4t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a blueprint for the next decade of Marvel heroes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="95xwsV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for the season finale of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iszm11"&gt;Details on the upcoming film, including a director, cast, and a release date, have yet to be officially announced by Disney. But both reports note that the upcoming film will likely follow up on the finale of the Disney Plus series, which saw Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson take up the shield and title of the new Captain America. The involvement of Spellman would also point to a continuation of that story, which left several plot threads unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsJMDF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;’s report also notes that the upcoming Spellman project is said to be separate from a rumored project that would see the original Captain America, Chris Evans, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/captain-america-eyes-return-to-the-mcu-as-chris-evans-nears-deal-to-reprise-role-in-future-marvel-project-1234672430/"&gt;return to reprise his role as Steve Rogers&lt;/a&gt; in the Marvel universe. Evans and Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/kevin-feige-chris-evans-captain-america-return/"&gt;have denied those rumors&lt;/a&gt;, although it wouldn’t be the first time that a &lt;a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/tatiana-maslany-denies-she-hulk/"&gt;member of a Marvel project&lt;/a&gt; has tried to deny their involvement in one of the superhero films &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/she-hulk-tatiana-maslany-mark-ruffalo-disney-plus"&gt;only to appear later on&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70qL5H"&gt;Marvel has yet to make an official announcement about the project, although it’s possible news could be coming soon, similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;Disney formally announced its &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; following that show’s season finale last December. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even Ellen has an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbxkDRwHUej86_GOTMT5aQ6jiTg=/0x6:827x557/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178018/ellen_nft_stick_cat.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R2Y9qD"&gt;How much would someone pay for the digital rights to an autographed copy of a selfie — featuring talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and a crude stick-figure drawing of a cat? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="8A0W7y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FDXGRW"&gt;We’ll soon find out — because Ellen is about to drop her very own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; next week, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/ellen-degeneres-nft-auction-1234958788/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, quite possibly making her the most mainstream celeb to cash in on the craze yet. The “Woman With Stick Cat” selfie will be one of them, as will her video monologue itself (in 4K resolution). The auction will start 9am PT on Monday, April 26th &lt;a href="https://www.bitski.com/ellen"&gt;at Bitski.com/ellen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNdtqc"&gt;Never fear, feline lovers: you’ll be able to get a high-res digital copy of “Woman With Stick Cat” in the auction as well, either by bidding on one of the 10 “rare” copies, an unlimited number of not-rare copies — or, no doubt, by right-clicking or long-pressing and saving the image to your device. Because you obviously want to inspect that cat’s finely penned features up close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHMo42"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports that it’s all for a good cause: proceeds will go to &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/apart-not-alone/5809169/jose-andres-coronavirus-food/"&gt;Chef José Andrés’ World Central Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, which has been donating tens of millions of meals in the wake of tragedy, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MfGdolPZivIzJnWU-xsdt_eJ5Cs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465763/45c4d96f_9a5b_4d79_bcb7_22133bac5a2e__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qFFNlP"&gt;Ellen definitely isn’t the first celeb to hop aboard the NFT train; &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/68570/snoop-dogg-twist-nyan-cat-nft-sells"&gt;Snoop Dogg reportedly sold his tweaked Nyan Cat NFT for $33,000&lt;/a&gt;, and the likes of deadmau5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353219/gorrilaz-artist-nft-release-environmental-concerns"&gt;and the Gorillaz&lt;/a&gt; have NFTs too. You could also argue that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;the NBA’s Top Shots&lt;/a&gt; or the New York Times (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350663/new-york-times-nft-auction-half-million-dollar-article-charity"&gt;whose columnist sold an NFT for over half a million dollars&lt;/a&gt;) are more mainstream than Ellen, too, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/media/ellen-degeneres-ratings-decline.html"&gt;now her viewership has declined by nearly half&lt;/a&gt; due to the backlash over &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21357113/ellen-degeneres-canceled-mean-backlash-toxic-workplace"&gt;reports of a toxic work environment&lt;/a&gt; on her show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2C3CS3"&gt;Speaking of toxic environments, you might want to read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;what NFTs might do to the Earth’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="DfT8ju"&gt;The United States should resume use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, an independent advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today. There is a small risk of a rare type of blood clot in women under 50, and health officials should warn patients of that risk, the committee stressed during its deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Tv12"&gt;Federal officials at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could lift the pause on the shot based on that recommendation soon —  &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/22/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots/"&gt;within hours or days.&lt;/a&gt; The FDA will likely add a warning label to the vaccine about the blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMhyBd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Federal officials at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could lift the pause on the shot based on that recommendation soon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb9kqp"&gt;Use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;paused&lt;/a&gt; in the US since April 13 as officials gathered more information about reports of unusual blood clots in a few people who received the shots. The patients had a type of blood clot that appears in the brain, called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, along with low levels of blood platelets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jig12"&gt;CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) said that the pause should be lifted after discussing the ways that the benefits of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot outweigh the risk of the blood clot, which is extremely rare.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This vaccine can protect people from COVID-19, and is also a key tool to protect vulnerable groups like people experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnsons-covid-19-vaccine-emerges-as-preferred-shot-for-homeless-11617530400"&gt;homelessness&lt;/a&gt; from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZejL9y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8XJo4"&gt;There have not been similar reports in people who received the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Around 200 million doses of those vaccines have been administered in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BoRmD"&gt;As of today, around 8 million people in the US have received the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot and there are 15 confirmed cases of the clots, all in women. Other potential cases are under investigation. Two of the women with confirmed cases are over 50 years old, and 13 are between 18 and 49 years old. Three of the women died, seven are hospitalized, and five are recovering at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR7W3B"&gt;Based on the available data, the risk of the clotting condition in women under 50 is seven cases per 1 million doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, the ACIP’s COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Technical Work Group &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/05-COVID-Lee-508.pdf"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;. The risk for women above 50 and men is less than one case per 1 million doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g9Uxtx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The risk for women above 50 and men is less than one case per 1 million doses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aJLO2h"&gt;The risk of this unusual condition has to be balanced against the benefits of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, said Grace Lee, associate chief medical officer for practice innovation at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in California and chair of the work group. The shots can prevent death, hospitalization, and clots associated with COVID-19. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson calculated that for every 1 million doses of its vaccine given, 2,000 COVID-19-related deaths and 6,000 COVID-19-related hospitalizations could be prevented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqM2SW"&gt;Part of the reason for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson pause was to give doctors and health care providers information about this clotting condition. Blood clots are usually treated with the blood thinner heparin, but in these patients, that type of medication could make the condition worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQsTYU"&gt;Increased awareness of the condition generated during the pause and investigation should help keep people safer, said Michael Streiff, the medical director of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Special Coagulation Laboratory, during a presentation at today’s ACIP meeting. Doctors know to look out for signs of these rare clots, and people who got the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will now know to look out for symptoms like a severe headache. Some of the people with the clots took a few days before they went to the doctor, and by that time, they were very sick, he said. “I think that education of the public and physicians will improve outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trPASy"&gt;The ACIP met last week just after the pause to discuss the initial reports, but said then that it did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22384503/johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine-pause-cdc-acip-clots"&gt;not have enough information&lt;/a&gt; to make a recommendation — effectively extending the pause. The CDC spent the interim collecting more information about the clots and their relationship to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine. “We would have done this work regardless of whether there was a pause or not,” Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, said during the committee meeting. “The pause did really focus our efforts on getting to the bottom of this quickly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cccUxs"&gt;The CDC will continue to monitor cases of the clotting condition using the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html"&gt;vaccine safety surveillance programs&lt;/a&gt;, which let patients and doctors report potential health problems after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="292wlS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California Governor sees an end to oil extraction in the state</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gavin Newsom visits an oil field in California" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56jXfdFDeKxXyWhSbITPB1Qelt0=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69177864/1157611018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Gov. Gavin Newsom tours the Chevron oil field west of Bakersfield where a spill of more than 900,000 gallons of oil and brine water oil has flowed into a dry creek bed July 24, 2019 near McKittrick, California.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D28MCQ"&gt;California Governor Gavin Newsom today set an aspirational 2045 deadline to stop all oil extraction in the state. He also said that he plans to ban hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking” for oil by 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8PPW2"&gt;“As we move to swiftly decarbonize our transportation sector and create a healthier future for our children, I’ve made it clear I don’t see a role for fracking in that future and, similarly, believe that California needs to move beyond oil,” he said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/04/23/governor-newsom-takes-action-to-phase-out-oil-extraction-in-california/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yWPP7Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW: California is now the first state to declare an end to oil extraction in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we're announcing that we will phase out all oil extraction — as part of a world-leading effort to achieve carbon neutrality — and ban fracking by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1385671067147005953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CovhfX"&gt;Newsom directed the state’s Department of Conservation to quit issuing new permits for fracking. Halting all oil extraction, however, will be more difficult. For now, he’s asked the California Air Resources Board to “analyze pathways” that could put an end to digging up new oil by 2045. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVfiNn"&gt;The embattled governor, who could soon face a recall election, previously &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-23/gavin-newsom-executive-limit-fracking-california"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he didn’t have the “authority” to ban fracking. State lawmakers tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/17/fracking-california-senate-bill-ban"&gt;pass legislation&lt;/a&gt; banning fracking earlier this year but &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-san-francisco-scott-wiener-legislation-oil-and-gas-industry-963839657250764c4296dfd461dbe22a"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;. Fracking is a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/4/14/18076690/fracking"&gt;controversial way&lt;/a&gt; of accessing hard-to-reach oil and gas reserves that poses threats to air and water quality. It only accounts for about two percent of oil production in the state, so Newsom will have to make good on his other commitment if he wants&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to have a big impact on the state’s oil production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E65X0K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’d be the biggest oil producer ever to announce an end to oil extraction”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDOeAr"&gt;California is the world’s fifth-largest economy, so its environmental goals hold weight. “This is significant. If California was a country, it’d be the biggest oil producer ever to announce an end to oil extraction,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonathangaventa?lang=en"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Jonathan Gaventa, a senior associate at the climate think tank E3G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqWQAn"&gt;Some said Newsom still isn’t getting ambitious enough. “Phasing out drilling by 2045 is inadequate. That’s twenty-four wildfire seasons away, with exponentially worsening conditions every year,” the Los Angeles chapter of the environmental organization Sunrise Movement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SunriseMvmtLA/status/1385673184846909450"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="859OSB"&gt;California has led the way on ambitious climate policy in the past. Last year, it became the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;state to ban&lt;/a&gt; the future sale of new internal combustion vehicles. In 2018, former governor Jerry Brown set a target for the whole state to be carbon neutral &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/11/17844896/california-jerry-brown-carbon-neutral-2045-climate-change"&gt;by 2045&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it won’t put out more planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions than it can offset or capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PW6jnd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGcnwh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLUofS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e024yj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may let you tip people for their great tweets right from their profiles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hcBbucs8OH_JYIGlKNLGeBC6fg=/0x14:1064x723/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69177768/Ezph50pVoAszQCf__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out that cash button.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aB2eIC"&gt;Twitter has said &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-test-communities-tipping-super-follows-183101868.html"&gt;it’s exploring features&lt;/a&gt; like tipping to give people a way to pay other Twitter users, and now we have further evidence that a tip feature may be on the way. App researcher Jane Manchun Wong shared images on Thursday and Friday showing that Twitter could offer a tipping button right on user profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHkLU1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385375100841586689"&gt;Here’s one iteration of what it could look like&lt;/a&gt; — check out the little blue cash button under the “@wongmjane” watermark in the left image. Clicking or tapping that button apparently shows options to let you tip via Bandcamp, Cash App (made by Square, which counts Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as its CEO, too), Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZEXXWp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on Tip Jar right on the user profile &lt;a href="https://t.co/kqzQmiDFKc"&gt;https://t.co/kqzQmiDFKc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/VacGyJJ8DU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VacGyJJ8DU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385375100841586689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhuCji"&gt;As you can see in this tweet, Wong also found evidence in March that Twitter is working on a “Tip Jar” feature for Twitter Spaces, the company’s Clubhouse-like social audio rooms (Clubhouse just introduced its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"&gt;direct payments feature on April 5th&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEqLK4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728"&gt;Here’s another look at the tipping button on profiles&lt;/a&gt;, from Wong. These screenshots show a black tipping button instead of a blue one. They also show designs Twitter is apparently testing for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;forthcoming Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you charge followers so they can access extra content. (Think Patreon, but for tweets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ehJ7sI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on the “Super Follow” button,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;as a small circular button , or a big “Super Follow” one&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;p.s. that cash button is for tipping: &lt;a href="https://t.co/A6Q6TiA1ku"&gt;https://t.co/A6Q6TiA1ku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter is also making their color scheme more monochrome, and is also using their new “Chirp” font &lt;a href="https://t.co/qSEjh0ohm8"&gt;https://t.co/qSEjh0ohm8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jb3Y9o4Yct"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jb3Y9o4Yct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bkjdzV"&gt;Twitter has not formally announced a tipping feature, so there’s no guarantee the company actually releases it publicly. Even if it does, it’s unclear if there would be any restrictions on who could put a tipping button on their profile. It seems possible that the feature will be gated in some way, perhaps requiring you to have a certain number of followers or be verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqsc6A"&gt;Twitter declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="G1qTTN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter announces paid Super Follows to let you charge for tweets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Beloved Japanese gaming store Super Potato has opened an eBay shop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Potato" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QVwzK2RECM4V98x647ZVUVHsDKw=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69177167/superpotato.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just a glimpse of what’s on a shelf at Super Potato in Akihabara, Tokyo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="41Bud4"&gt;Visiting Super Potato in Akihabara is usually a key reason why many die-hard gamers want to venture to Japan. The flagship Super Potato store (of the eight total in Japan, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuperpotatoG?"&gt;according to its Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) is nondescript, yet its shelves are covered wall-to-wall in rare yet reasonably priced games and consoles. It’s a magical place that’s a store-meets-museum. It’s fun enough to just look around, but if you’re a collector, there aren’t many places left where you can walk in and pick up a Virtual Boy headset or find a cache of Sega Dreamcast games that never released outside of Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxvQQB"&gt;My point is that you &lt;em&gt;absolutely should&lt;/em&gt; go at some point if you can. But thankfully, going there in person isn’t the only way you can peep the store’s vast collection of retro Japanese video games. Per &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-potato-famous-japanese-video-game-shop-has-a-new-international-ebay-store?utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the beloved store has taken at least some of its wares to eBay, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fstr%2Fsuperpotatoretrogames%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399700%2Fsuper-potato-retro-video-game-store-ebay-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can shop your heart out without leaving the country or your computer seat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPUoso"&gt;Many of the games listed are for the Famicom and Super Famicom released in Japan, so they’re in Japanese.

Super Potato’s online store currently lists games like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193919621794%3Fhash%3Ditem2d26829aa2%3Ag%3AsZcAAOSwURNgOIxa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399700%2Fsuper-potato-retro-video-game-store-ebay-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193919621794%3Fhash%3Ditem2d26829aa2%3Ag%3AsZcAAOSwURNgOIxa%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399700%2Fsuper-potato-retro-video-game-store-ebay-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193919621794%3Fhash%3Ditem2d26829aa2%3Ag%3AsZcAAOSwURNgOIxa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399700%2Fsuper-potato-retro-video-game-store-ebay-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;antasy I + II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Famicom, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193925938593%3Fepid%3D214749560%26hash%3Ditem2d26e2fda1%3Ag%3ANzkAAOSwfeJgPHzP%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399700%2Fsuper-potato-retro-video-game-store-ebay-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Metroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Super Famicom, as well as Japanese versions of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193937238953%3Fhash%3Ditem2d278f6ba9%3Ag%3A9dEAAOSw0sxgQa%7EK%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399700%2Fsuper-potato-retro-video-game-store-ebay-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;original Game Boy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193931086748%3Fhash%3Ditem2d27318b9c%3Ag%3AAmYAAOSwnL1gPvfk%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399700%2Fsuper-potato-retro-video-game-store-ebay-online" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo 64&lt;/a&gt; for a fair price, I might say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z6ASR"&gt;Shipping to the US for most items costs $20, which is also reasonable. I’d expect Super Potato’s eBay listings to change frequently, so it’s a great site to bookmark, especially if importing games is a hobby. Who knows what you’ll find tomorrow or the next day? &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You probably won’t find this limited edition version of Metal Gear Solid for the PS1, signed by Hideo Kojima and Yoji Shinkawa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0bjtaj"&gt;Tourism has sharply declined around the world during the pandemic, and since Super Potato likely relies on gaming-obsessed tourists for a chunk of its revenue, branching out to eBay seems like a smart way to give gamers what they want. But once the pandemic ends, I highly suggest visiting the store in person if you have the opportunity. Then take as many pictures as you can so you can remember the store — or in my case, to put them in articles like these.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube makes it easier to save on data with new video resolution options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HotfZ2qKIRCQeaaRGBrz9LWKI2M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176603/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbCxa0"&gt;The YouTube mobile app for iOS and Android now has new video settings that might make it a bit easier to save on data while watching video on the go (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/23/youtube-adds-even-more-video-resolution-controls-and-options-on-mobile/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Along with specific resolutions in the video player, you can now toggle between three separate modes that either favor video quality, data use, or whatever works best for your current internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBXfCp"&gt;You might already be familiar with “auto” mode as the default setting for most videos, which automatically adjusts video resolution depending on your current internet speed to give the best experience. YouTube’s new additions are the “higher picture quality” mode, which uses more data when not on Wi-Fi and defaults to 720p, and a “data saver” mode that maxes out at 480p.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkG6Bx4FQtnsiKGWLwFjoM1myyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465137/YouTube_resolutionsSettings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new video settings include options for “higher picture quality” and “data saver.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CtqSNK"&gt;While these umbrella modes are good for quick scenario-specific adjustments to resolution, you can still dig in and get granular with specific resolutions. And any resolution adjustments can be set for the specific video you’re watching or system-wide for everything you watch, with specific behaviors for Wi-Fi and mobile networks. YouTube &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200309015249/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/91449?hl=en"&gt;has had resolution settings&lt;/a&gt; and ways to keep the app &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/20/how-to-save-data-android/"&gt;from downloading / streaming HD videos&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but this automates the data-saving process and reframes it in a way that’s easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUORpPGbGr2gBBgSsO8L-W2-5L8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465170/youTube_settings.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video settings can also be applied system-wide, with separate behavior for mobile and Wi-Fi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIehp0"&gt;In an ideal world, none of this would matter and you could just watch high-resolution cooking videos (my preferred YouTube zone-out material of choice) to your heart’s content. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;But even on “unlimited” plans&lt;/a&gt;, most mobile carriers still cap video resolution at 480p. Videos watched at higher resolutions typically count against some kind of premium data allotment or other terrible carrier jargon and hit you where it hurts — in your monthly bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZl961"&gt;YouTube’s new video settings aren’t a magic bullet solution, but they make it easier to switch to a carrier-acceptable resolution without having to think about it. And when all my brain wants is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJx9y9Toto"&gt;ASMR donut videos&lt;/a&gt;, that certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WeXuhD"&gt;When it comes to truly wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, I encourage you to read out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;Best Wireless Earbuds buyer’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you determine which pair of earbuds is best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products in general, the AirPods Pro are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant has better sound quality and features noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. You can also get a new pair for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; has the AirPods Pro for $220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of second-generation AirPods. The entry-level model includes a wired charging case. Usually retailing for $160, you can get them for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;For a few dollars more, you can get a new pair of AirPods with a wireless charging case. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, they are $160 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are no current deals available for the Galaxy Buds Pro, but you can buy a pair for the usual retail price of $200 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771584476830246" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771635387220077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614521-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r190nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_pro_noise_canceling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Plus were our top pick last year as the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in different color options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now — but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. These are a good option if you want earbuds that produce a powerful sound and include lengthy battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScDytt"&gt;The lowest price you can buy the Samsung GalaxyBuds Live is $110 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735168432735464332#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt; But, if you want new pair of these bean-shaped earbuds you can get them for $170 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733697059048914646#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736564903391373246#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="u5smDl"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t. Although no deals are available now, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for their normal price of $230 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If a $230 price tag is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. The Jabra 75t are our pick for the best true wireless earbuds that are ideal for the multitasker in your life. They’re a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;If you are in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the Beats Powerbeats Pro. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about sweat ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at Best Buy for $160 in either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773029374008951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773015236913845" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
