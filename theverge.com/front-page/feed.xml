    <title>Samsung’s new Google-based smartwatch software addresses a lot of old annoyances</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WbQTDagnka64SQbxB_rCkJBb0uM=/297x0:3063x1844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514225/Screen_Shot_2021_06_25_at_5.17.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqJ6KU"&gt;Samsung has taken the wraps off it and Google’s new unified smartwatch platform at MWC 2021 — sort of. The company isn’t announcing a new Galaxy Watch today, or even what the new platform will be called (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"&gt;it’s unofficially referred to as Wear&lt;/a&gt;); those announcements will come later this summer at a proper Galaxy Unpacked event. But what Samsung did show off was a first look at what its new One UI Watch software will look like, and it elaborated on just what the new Google / Samsung partnership could mean for future Galaxy Watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXs5DU"&gt;To be clear: what Samsung is showing of One UI Watch won’t be what &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; smartwatches built on the new unified Google / Samsung platform look like — it’s an added layer on top specifically for Samsung devices. It’s similar to what Samsung’s One UI does for Samsung’s smartphones. The goal is a consistent look and experience across all of Samsung’s hardware and software, and so far it looks lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sua81Z"&gt;The Settings menu has been redesigned to look more like the phone’s menu, and things sync from the phone: if you have additional time zones set in your clock app, they’ll be there on the watch, and blocked callers on the phone will be blocked on watches, too. Samsung also showed off a new watchface design tool, which will be available for Android developers next year to easily create new watchfaces for the platform. It’s unclear yet if current Tizen or Wear OS watchfaces will work with the new OS or One UI Watch, but the current options have also been seriously lacking, so any new choices — even ones largely reliant on developers — are welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4l1Ho"&gt;Best of all, similar to the Apple Watch, when you install a smartwatch-compatible app on your phone, the corresponding watch app will automatically install on the watch as well. You won't need to manually install anything as you currently do on Tizen-based watches, or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/wow-google-show-us-how-you-really-feel-about-wear-os-1846674295"&gt;deal with the weird on-wrist app store&lt;/a&gt; that has made getting apps on Wear OS frustrating. You’ll just download an app to your phone and it should appear directly on your wrist, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrybd4"&gt;The new One UI Watch experience is expected to first appear on Samsung wearables at a Samsung Unpacked event later this year. Given other recent Samsung hardware rumors, it sounds like this Unpacked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;should be a big flipping deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ndu9Vn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36gDmr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft releases Windows 11 preview, available to download now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1mSSDpOU1CesHICQ9nTpZhg9ovo=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514135/Windows_11_Start_3D.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QDGwUZ"&gt;Microsoft is releasing its first Windows 11 preview build today. Windows Insiders can download the Windows 11 preview (&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/28/announcing-the-first-insider-preview-for-windows-11/"&gt;build 22000.51&lt;/a&gt;) right now, which includes access to the new Start menu, multitasking features, and overhauled Microsoft Store. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;previous Windows 11 leak&lt;/a&gt;, this official preview also features an updated File Explorer that replaces the ribbon with a command bar to simplify file management a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehFx6W"&gt;Most of the Windows 11 visual changes that Microsoft revealed last week will be available in this initial preview. The new Start menu with its centered launcher-like interface is part of this build, alongside rounded corners throughout the OS and improvements to the notification center, volume flyouts, and more. If your PC has an accelerometer, the Windows 11 lock screen will also include a parallax motion effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3z0zrkYF3B1jmbxWpgMxPz4a1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686513/File_Explorer_CommandBar.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 File Explorer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CQZURd"&gt;Windows 11’s new themes and dark / light mode improvements are also part of this preview, alongside the new Widgets feature. All of the new themes — Glow, Captured Motion, Sunrise, and Flow — are designed with the centered taskbar in mind, and Microsoft has coupled them with new sounds in Windows 11 as you use the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxIKns"&gt;Two big Windows 11 features are missing, though: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams integration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Android apps on Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Both are still being developed and tested by Microsoft but will appear in later preview builds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j0pupYXTugyJJCZKfcIGXbz3POo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686514/Quick_Settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New media controls in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wdCq4X"&gt;This Windows 11 preview also includes Microsoft’s new Snap Groups and Snap Layouts features, to improve multitasking across a variety of screen sizes. These new Snap features build on a lot of the multitasking features that have been in Windows for years but make them easier to discover and more useful — particularly in multiple-monitor scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9ILlp"&gt;Microsoft is also overhauling the Settings section of Windows 11. This preview build include changes that make it easier to navigate around and find the setting you need. Settings now has a left-hand navigation panel that persists throughout, making it quicker to switch between sections. Microsoft has built new “hero” controls at the top that offer quick access to information or settings that are relevant for each section.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-G-QaCg9ZMJleoRDR2t8GFewgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686515/Settings_Personalization.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overhauled Settings in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="39q7kg"&gt;Alongside the Windows 11 preview today, Microsoft is also releasing a preview of its Office refresh for Windows 11. The updated UI includes rounded corners in Office apps to match Windows 11 and some changes to how the dark and light modes work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2ziLM"&gt;If you’re interested in testing the Windows 11 preview build, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/"&gt;enroll in the Windows Insiders program&lt;/a&gt; and then navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Insider Program on a Windows 10 device to enable the Dev Channel and obtain Windows 11 builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3I3dO"&gt;You’ll need a compatible machine, although Microsoft says it’s waving its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;new hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; during this preview period for those who have been testing Windows builds prior to June 24th. Otherwise, you’ll need to use &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11%23pchealthcheck" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s PC Health Check app&lt;/a&gt; to see if your system is compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yreTO9"&gt;We wouldn’t recommend installing these previews on a machine you use daily, as there will be bugs and unfinished features. In fact, Microsoft has a &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/28/announcing-the-first-insider-preview-for-windows-11/"&gt;number of known issues it lists&lt;/a&gt;, and these are the important ones you should be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="T0WOuV"&gt;the taskbar will not be shown across multiple monitors (will be fixed in an upcoming build)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vjTvJp"&gt;when upgrading a device with multiple user accounts to Windows 11, Settings will fail to launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ipyJoc"&gt;the Microsoft Store install button might not be functional yet in “some limited scenarios”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Leaked OnePlus Nord 2 renders reveal OnePlus 9-like design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n7ashGDofx1Rz6ONLmrxn6Dfh20=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513991/OnePlus_Nord2_5K2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 91mobiles and OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6wZqVK"&gt;In 2020, OnePlus expanded its product lineup with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;the midrange OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;, and new leaked renders from &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt; have given us a good look at what the rumored next phone in the Nord line might look like. You can see the renders &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/IpzuSFBc5EM"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; (which I’ve also embedded at the top of this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xpjOD"&gt;The phone, which I will call the Nord 2 (though we don’t know if that might be the official name) looks to take a lot of design cues from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;the OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, particularly with the similar-looking rounded rectangle rear camera module and the hole-punch selfie camera. That rear camera module houses 50-megapixel, 8-megapixel, and 2-megapixel cameras, while the selfie camera is 32 megapixels, according to &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d1PxXb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And here comes your very first look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlusNord2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OnePlusNord2&lt;/a&gt;! (stunning 5K renders and 360° video)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On behalf of my Friends over &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/91mobiles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@91mobiles&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/E7QFLTs8f9"&gt;https://t.co/E7QFLTs8f9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BdxNecaYlh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BdxNecaYlh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1409474091590033411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DVromJ"&gt;As for the screen,&lt;em&gt; 91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; reports that the Nord 2 will have a 6.43-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate and will “probably” have an in-screen fingerprint sensor. The phone will also have a MediaTek Dimensity 1200 system on a chip, up to 12GB of RAM, and as much as 256GB of storage — though that storage “may not be expandable,” according to &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;. The Nord 2 is also rumored to have a 4,500mAh battery and support for 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJWDx5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt; expects that the Nord 2 will be released on July 9th, but we don’t know which markets it could be available in just yet. The original OnePlus Nord didn’t launch in the US, but the product line came stateside with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G and OnePlus Nord N100 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1SNhmt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord N10 5G and N100 are coming to the US on January 15th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"},{"title":"OnePlus Nord review: the right compromises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV launches 4K and offline downloads today, but they don’t come cheap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpHb12cgzVzTNmGF1tJYch66rtE=/47x0:1679x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513791/yttv.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs6oFt"&gt;YouTube TV is today revealing more details about two anticipated new features: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286374/youtube-tv-4k-streaming-offline-viewing-announced"&gt;4K playback and offline downloads&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, the service will be bundling them together in a new add-on package it’s calling &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/10383365"&gt;“4K Plus.”&lt;/a&gt; There’s no getting one without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgIQe0"&gt;4K Plus is available starting today and will cost an extra $19.99 per month on top of the standard &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;$64.99 YouTube TV subscription&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds awfully expensive, but at least there’s this: customers will receive a free one-month trial — and if you sign up early, 4K Plus will be discounted to $9.99 each month for the first year. That’s easier to swallow than $20, but you’ll eventually be shifted over to the full price once that initial promotion expires. So for the first year, you’re looking at a $75 monthly bill, and $85 if you keep 4K Plus after that. Add in taxes and fees and, well, ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRDYrI"&gt;For now, offline downloads will likely be a bigger deal for many customers than 4K streaming. Outside of select sporting events, there’s still a dearth of 4K content on network and cable TV. (For that reason, some competing services like FuboTV don’t charge extra for 4K streams.) YouTube really isn’t in any position to solve that dilemma, but it’s promising that 4K Plus subscribers will be able to “watch major sports events this summer in 4K, plus live content from networks like NBC, sports like college football and basketball later this year, and on-demand content from FX, Discovery Networks, Tastemade and more.” You can search for “4K” to see all available 4K programs. YouTube TV is also preparing for the Olympics with new features that will let you quickly jump to specific sports or moments of an event without having to manually scrub through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9D2tT"&gt;When asked whether offline downloads will face any channel or content restrictions, YouTube told me that anything recorded to your cloud DVR from the base channel package can be downloaded to YouTube TV’s mobile app. So in theory, you shouldn’t run into any frustrating limitations or channels that block the feature. I’d hope for as much considering the price! However, the company noted that some premium network add-ons might not allow offline downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RKQLF"&gt;At least among streaming TV services, offline viewing is a rare convenience. Sling TV doesn’t offer it, and Hulu only &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/downloads"&gt;supports offline downloads&lt;/a&gt; from its on-demand library of shows and movies. In the case of YouTube TV, you’re actually pulling down the entire DVR recording as it originally aired, so this approach is somewhat unique and Tivo-esque. YouTube told me that customers will have full control over playback, and rewind / fast-forward should work without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TofyPV"&gt;Adding 4K Plus to your account also enables “unlimited” concurrent streams for any devices that are on your home Wi-Fi network. YouTube TV usually limits customers to three simultaneous streams, and this will still apply for devices that are outside your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SAMJcH"&gt;Dolby 5.1 surround is coming to YouTube TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hZYHfx"&gt;In welcome news for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; YouTube TV customers, the service will also be introducing support for Dolby 5.1 surround sound “soon.” And this doesn’t require any special plan or add-on. YouTube says 5.1 audio has consistently been among the biggest feature requests from subscribers. It’ll be rolling out to “select devices” over the coming weeks. Smart TVs are first on the list, with other platforms to follow in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Australian regulator says Apple’s AirTag batteries are too easy for kids to access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4OuukCNGOC_M9WpDmGbu1xQS70M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513709/vpavic_4547_20210421_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JSEfOK"&gt;Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has warned buyers to keep Apple AirTags away from young children, saying it’s too easy to remove a potentially dangerous battery from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;tiny location trackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITh5Cu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/parents-urged-to-keep-apple-airtags-away-from-children-as-safety-precaution"&gt;An ACCC statement&lt;/a&gt; cautions that AirTags’ small lithium button batteries can severely injure children if they leak or become stuck in a child’s throat, nose, or ear. It raises particular concerns about Apple’s design making those batteries too readily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OzgGzC"&gt;“The ACCC is concerned that the AirTag’s battery compartment could be accessible to young children, and the button battery removed with ease. In addition, the AirTag battery compartment’s lid does not always secure fully on closing, and a distinctive sound plays when an AirTag’s lid is being closed, suggesting the lid is secure when it may not be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jQA7PQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/28/keep-airtags-away-from-children/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Australian retailer Officeworks &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/04/airtags-withdrawn-from-sale-officeworks/"&gt;removed AirTags&lt;/a&gt; from its shelves last month, citing safety concerns. Apple has since added a new warning label to AirTag packaging, and the ACCC quotes Apple as saying that AirTags are “designed to meet international child safety standards.” The agency states that it’s currently discussing safety issues with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecouuv"&gt;Many devices — including AirTag competitors — use button batteries. Some companies make them tougher to remove; Tile trackers, for instance, &lt;a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009446833-How-do-I-replace-a-battery-"&gt;require a paperclip&lt;/a&gt; or precision screwdriver to swap a battery. Australia recently introduced new, stricter overall safety rules for devices using button batteries, and Apple isn’t the only company in the ACCC’s sights. Its statement says that it’s “assessing whether there are issues with button battery safety in similar Bluetooth tracking devices,” and companies that don’t meet the new standards will have until June 2022 to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All the announcements from Samsung’s virtual MWC event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWpA3b6v6JRlM73AeYT0AySEu3A=/141x0:1653x1008/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513459/Screen_Shot_2021_06_21_at_5.49.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Smartwatches and security&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="5ItsRS"&gt;Samsung will hold its Mobile World Congress event virtually this year, which looks to focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544257/samsung-google-wear-os-smartwatch-mwc-2021-announcement-preview"&gt;Samsung’s smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, as well as how the company is “enhancing security.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwtb0e"&gt;Smartwatches from Samsung are especially interesting this year, given that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;will merge its wearable OS with Google’s&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible we’ll get some information about the OS if Samsung announces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;the rumored Galaxy Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;, which could be announced at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iylEkL"&gt;In the security realm, Samsung announced its &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/understanding-samsung-knox-vault-protecting-data-matters-most/"&gt;Knox Vault feature&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-brings-next-level-security-to-galaxy-devices-with-samsung-knox-vault"&gt;Galaxy S21 devices last week&lt;/a&gt;, with a hint that it could be coming to other Galaxy devices in the future. A Knox logo is displayed prominently in the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfSZvIqYDSM"&gt;event livestream’s thumbnail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ5NPt"&gt;There are also rumors and leaks of Samsung working on new folding phones: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;. It’s always possible Samsung could highlight a new foldable device or two before the event is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEdO1l"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22549337/samsung-mwc-live-stream-watch-start-time-how-to"&gt;The event starts&lt;/a&gt; June 28th at 1:15PM ET / 10:15AM PT, and you can keep track of all Samsung’s announcements here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki is coming to Fortnite in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8RizIKHxxdfF3z14oAIHhicVP-4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513393/fortnite_lokis_welcoming_loading_screen_1920x1080_2d21e635ec8a.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jtrp6l"&gt;In a completely expected turn of events, Loki — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;star of the latest MCU show on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; — is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/no-men-like-him-loki-laufeyson-enters-the-fortnite-crew-for-july"&gt;coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a playable character&lt;/a&gt;. But there is a twist for those looking to bring the mischievous god into a battle royale match. Loki won’t be on sale in the regular item shop, but instead will only be accessible for subscribers of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Crew, a monthly service. He’ll be available starting in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SAoq4l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gZGoar"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612524/fortnite-crew-subscription-chapter-2-season-5-price-release-date"&gt;Crew launched last year&lt;/a&gt;. It costs $12 per month, getting users access to V-bucks and exclusive items, along with the current season’s battle pass. One of the big hooks is that the items are truly exclusive; Epic says that “they will never be sold to non-Crew members or given away to non-Crew members.” Which means that if you want to play as Loki, you’ll need to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg3CRC"&gt;Of course, this is far from the first time that Marvel or Disney characters have appeared in the game. Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s fourth season was entirely Marvel-themed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;which was followed by the Mandalorian and his pal Grogu&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, Thanos was added as a playable character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNBPp1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is currently in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22550116/uap-ufo-pentagon-report-aliens"&gt;a well-timed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;alien invasion-themed season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Foundation trailer teases Apple TV Plus’ ambitious sci-fi epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mohboaJl1O-BxjVERoORRaNlhIY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513208/062821_Apple_Sneak_Peek_Foundation.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UQFAID"&gt;Last week Apple revealed that &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming sc-fi show based on a series of books by Isaac Asimov, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;would debut on Apple TV Plus in September&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have something even better: a proper trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuYkOB"&gt;It’s the first good look at the show since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295512/apple-tv-plus-foundation-show-trailer-isaac-asimov-wwdc-2020"&gt;the debut teaser last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it reveals what looks to be an ambitious series that could give Apple’s streaming service its own must-watch epic along the lines of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. The trailer shows lavish sets, big-name stars, and, of course, a baby floating in a tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZXK69q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Foundation’ has always been at the top of my bucket list.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PygMcd"&gt;The show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223728/apple-foundation-trilogy-isaac-asimov-tv-show-david-goyer-josh-friedman"&gt;which was first announced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, is being helmed by showrunner David S. Goyer, and stars Lee Pace and Jared Harris. According to Apple, the story “chronicles a band of exiles on their monumental journey to save humanity and rebuild civilization amid the fall of the Galactic Empire.” Here’s Goyer on the adaptation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BEl1P7"&gt;In the decades since the &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; series first saw print, Asimov’s prophetic science-fiction work has never been more relevant than it is now. Growing up, I devoured &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; and dreamed of one day seeing it on screen — but a feature film didn’t seem big enough to embrace the ambition. Thanks to the broader landscape of streaming and a valuable partnership with Apple and Skydance, we are able to bring the series to the screen in a way that truly does it justice. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; has always been at the top of my bucket list and I’m honored I get to play a part in finally bringing it to life. Whether you’re a fan of the novels or simply someone craving a mind-blowing epic, I’m excited to share with you what we’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="B2hNJQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; will debut on September 24th, with the first three (of 10) episodes available initially. Subsequent episodes will debut every Friday after that. It will follow another high-profile release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season premiering in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha laptop is $250 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LB-KgCjsHnot871mWguFP-66E3I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513206/flex2alpha.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You’re getting a solid laptop for $800&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LiQfBj"&gt;Samsung released its latest wave of Windows 10 laptops in late April, and one of them is already seeing a significant discount. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744705098486504908#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Galaxy Book Flex2 Alpha is $800&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy when you clip the $100 “Student Deal” discount underneath its asking price (you’ll need to sign in with a Best Buy account). This is $250 off its original $1,049 price. For an $800 laptop, the Flex 2 Alpha has a lot going for it, like its QLED display, a recent 11th Gen Intel Core i7 1167G5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and that it’s a flexible 2-in-1 form factor. It comes with 512GB of storage, and its ports include two USB Type-A 3.0 ports, one USB-C port, a headphone jack, a power plug, HDMI, and a microSD slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCabzG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744705556145537805#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The lower-spec version of the Flex2 Alpha&lt;/a&gt; that has half the RAM and storage, as well as an 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor instead of a Core i7 costs $600 at Best Buy (originally $849).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J6vAlo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10627416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMc4o4"&gt;Google has slashed the cost of its Nest Wifi router bundle that includes a Point extender. Normally $269 outside of a sale, it costs $189 at retailers like &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Wifi-2-Pack-AC2200-Mesh-Router-with-1-Point%2F575491453&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1032678/1036?sharedid=VergeGooglesNestBundle042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00822us.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744706609829695511#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Considering that a single Nest Wifi router costs $169 (and the Point extenders usually sell for an additional $149 each), paying just $20 more is a bargain if you want to cover a large space with a reliable Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhuACA"&gt;The Nest Wifi is faster than the original Google Wifi, but it’s still a Wi-Fi 5 mesh system. Some other important things to note are that the router has two ethernet jacks, while the Point extender has none. Though, the Point can operate as both an extender and a smart speaker with Google Assistant built in. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check out Dan Seifert’s review for more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T4SMJR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yrvb1c"&gt;You have another chance to save big on Sony’s WH-1000XM4 over-ear wireless headphones that are known for their excellent sound quality and noise cancellation effect. While any deals on new models came and went with Prime Day, there’s still a good deal &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F274493598619%3Fepid%3D18040267377%26hash%3Ditem3fe917eb9b%3Ag%3ArVYAAOSwvGNfXj%7E-%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F28%2F22553763%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-flex-2-alpha-laptop-google-pixel-3-nest-wifi-datacolor-spyderx-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;happening on eBay for a refurbished set that costs just $200&lt;/a&gt; (originally $349 new). It’s said to function like new and shows “minimal if any, signs of wear” according to the eBay listing. All accessories are included, and this is being sold by a seller with a 98.7 percent positive rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="he5iMj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OnvDlI"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 keeps getting more affordable. At B&amp;amp;H Photo, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636459-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00465_us_pixel_3_64gb_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F28%2F22553763%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-flex-2-alpha-laptop-google-pixel-3-nest-wifi-datacolor-spyderx-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can snag an unlocked version with 64GB of storage in the “not pink” colorway for $130&lt;/a&gt;. At this price, it’s far more affordable than the Pixel 3A or 4A, and it has a few advantages. It has an IP68 rating for dust and waterproofing, it supports wireless charging, and its glass and metal design feels more high-end than Google’s more recent midrange phones. As you might expect, its camera is great, too. Yet, the reason there are so many Pixel 3 discounts recently could be because Android 12 is the phone’s last major update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mj6MB0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="owfLWM"&gt;If you want to ensure that your display is color-accurate for editing photos, or just for your own satisfaction, Datacolor’s SpyderX Pro colorimeter can help you do that with its companion software — and it’s all discounted for a limited time at B&amp;amp;H Photo. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1456247-REG%2Fdatacolor_sxp100_spyder_x_pro_colorimeter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F28%2F22553763%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-flex-2-alpha-laptop-google-pixel-3-nest-wifi-datacolor-spyderx-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Normally $170, it’s $100&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 12.9 Max Plus is Brydge’s best iPad keyboard yet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest trackpad you can get, if not necessarily the best&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6xcL1r"&gt;Brydge has been making iPad keyboards for nearly a decade now, and while the iPad itself has changed a lot over that time, the company has largely followed the same formula: design a keyboard that makes the iPad look like a MacBook Pro. The key design element has been the company’s trademark rubberized hinges, which the iPad slots into to form the other half of a laptop-style device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NBjK6"&gt;Now, Brydge is trying something slightly new. The 12.9 Max Plus, which starts shipping this week, is a keyboard case for the iPad Pro that does away with the hinge clamps and instead makes use of magnets for a sleeker and more convenient experience. The product also leans hard into Apple’s recent addition of cursor support to iPadOS, with a huge trackpad that’s comparable in size to what you’d find on a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtPHtr"&gt;At $249.99, this is a premium product aimed at heavy iPad Pro users, and it’s only available for the biggest iPad size. Apple’s own Magic Keyboard is clearly formidable competition. But Brydge is able to undercut Apple by $100, and in some important ways, I prefer the Max Plus to the Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="riplm7"&gt;The most obvious difference between the Max Plus and other Brydge keyboards is the magnetic plate in which you rest the iPad. This offers protection for the back of the iPad without having to attach the snap-on magnetic cover that Brydge included on prior models, and more importantly, it’s far less fiddly to attach and detach the iPad than it was to squeeze it into the old-style hinge clamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOMG5x"&gt;The tradeoff, of course, is that you’re adding a few millimeters of thickness behind the iPad, especially if (like me) you never bothered with the magnetic protective back covers supplied with previous Brydge keyboards. With 17mm of thickness and an extra 970g of weight, the resulting 12.9-inch “laptop” you get with the Max Plus is quite a bit thicker and heavier than a 13-inch MacBook Pro. The heft does help stabilize the combination, however, and it supports a wider range of viewing angles than the Magic Keyboard while feeling much more premium. As a tall person, the Magic Keyboard doesn’t always tilt back far enough to be comfortable for me, but I don’t have a problem with this Brydge. It’s also easier to use on your lap than a kickstand-based solution, as found in many of Logitech’s iPad keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4TfDO"&gt;While the magnet mechanism is convenient, the Max Plus unfortunately doesn’t use Apple’s Smart Connector for power and connectivity. This is still a Bluetooth device that you have to charge over USB-C, though the battery should last weeks or months on a charge depending on your usage (specifically how much you use the backlight). The Smart Connector would have been preferable, but it’s only ever appeared on Apple’s own products and Logitech devices that have been designed with Apple’s cooperation; it hasn’t shown up in any Brydge products or other devices from similarly smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been testing the white version of the Max Plus, which creates an unusual sandwich effect with my space gray iPad Pro. Silver and gray options are also available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mj753N"&gt;Brydge has at least improved the Bluetooth experience in one notable way compared to most of its older products. The Max Plus has a feature called Instant-On that makes use of Bluetooth 5.0 to stay in a low-power state for up to four hours, meaning that if you step away from the iPad and come back it’ll instantly wake with a button press with no need for reconnection. That goes some way to making the combination feel more like a coherent product, because in practice you aren’t likely to find yourself running into laggy reconnection issues during a typical work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xTdfx"&gt;The keyboard itself is good. It feels a touch more responsive than previous Brydge products, but you’re not getting mechanical-level tactility here, of course — it’s just an above-average laptop keyboard. What really sets it apart when compared to Apple’s Magic Keyboard is the extra function row, which is very useful in iPadOS for things like brightness and volume control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6EipB"&gt;The trackpad is a key selling point for the Max Plus. It can’t quite match the Magic Keyboard on pure responsiveness, which is no surprise given Apple’s low-level system access, but it does a good job nonetheless, and Brydge has been making continuous improvements to the firmware. It’s a huge trackpad by any standard, which makes using it for things like photo browsing and text editing a lot more enjoyable. Even though it has a diving board-style mechanism that doesn’t let you click everywhere (particularly in the upper left and right corners), there’s more than enough space and I had no problem using it just like I would a MacBook Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUqIRlpRPwD7GiezfnjCWXV-_4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685745/IMG_20210628_151714_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge Max Plus has a huge trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE52s4"&gt;The Brydge Max Plus isn’t for everyone, but then neither are iPad keyboards in general. Even though Apple came out with a good option last year, it’s very expensive and not without its quirks. What you get with the Max Plus is a less expensive — but still quite pricey — option that, more so than any Brydge keyboard to date, gives the iPad a laptop’s form factor and functionality. It’s not as slick or as inventive as the Magic Keyboard, but it’s more useful for my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2qqMw"&gt;Brydge is really competing with itself here as much as Apple. Its previous highest end model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;the 12.9 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, just got a significant price cut to $169.99 and offers essentially the same functionality, just with a smaller trackpad and the old hinge design. I prefer the Max Plus, but the Pro Plus is a good option if you want to save some weight and cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hd8LsO"&gt;There are still clear limitations to iPadOS, but cursor support really transformed the experience of working on an iPad, and no accessory embodies that better than the Brydge Max Plus. It’s not perfect, but right now it’s what I’d choose to get work done on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
