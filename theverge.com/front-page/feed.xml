    <title>Sling TV is raising prices and sweetening the deal with more free DVR space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sling TV stock 2040" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Itb9Bj5jWsT0SiawGhi6QqvDAJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730556/theverge1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6VDsHf"&gt;Sling TV, Dish’s live TV streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sling-tv-expands-free-dvr-storage-updates-pricing-for-new-customers-301216392.html"&gt;announced that it’s raising the prices&lt;/a&gt; on its packages and add-ons for new customers starting today. Both the Orange and Blue channel packages from Sling will go up by $5 to $35 per month for new subscribers or $50 per month when bundled together. Because of Sling’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310302/sling-tv-same-price-guarantee-youtube-tv-att-fubotv"&gt;one-year price guarantee&lt;/a&gt;, current subscribers won’t have to deal with the new prices until August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NffPWD"&gt;Along with the changes to the packages, Sling TV add-ons are also getting a small price bump. The “Sports Extra” for live sports is going up by $1 to $11 per month for new customers who subscribe to either Sling Blue or Orange. Customers who bundle Blue and Orange together will still pay $15 per month for the sports add-on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU4kkS"&gt;All other extras and add-ons for comedy, lifestyle, and news channels will be raised by $1 to $6 per month. If navigating all of those add-ons seems like too much, Sling TV’s giant “total TV deal” for every add-on the service offers is available for new Orange or Blue package subscribers for $21 per month ($1 more than before). If you’re bundling Orange and Blue, you can get the deal for $27 per month ($2 more than before).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EryhMc"&gt;In addition to the new higher prices, Sling TV is also throwing in extra hours of DVR space. Customers will now have 10 extra hours, bringing up the total to 50 hours. If you subscribe to Sling’s DVR Plus add-on, your total DVR space will shoot up to 200 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvqOoR"&gt;Sling last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035080/sling-tv-orange-blue-price-increase-subscription"&gt;raised prices in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but this year’s changes come after a cascade of rising TV subscription costs from competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/a&gt;. At $50 per month for the combined Sling Orange and Sling Blue bundle, Sling TV is still cheaper than YouTube TV at $64.99 a month or Hulu with Live TV for the same price. Sling TV’s various add-ons and packages make it a lot more complicated to navigate, but if you’re looking for core cable channels, you can still get a deal at Sling, albeit a slightly more expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook usage has soared during the pandemic, but the company warns of ‘significant uncertainty’ ahead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HStDhMW9rpARToE36CjcNxmKvUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730404/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0581_1stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aPpRYl"&gt;Facebook finished 2020 much stronger financially than at the beginning of the year, proving its business could weather the coronavirus pandemic and even thrive thanks to skyrocketing screen time these past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UikNnA"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx"&gt;reported fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; of more than $28 billion in revenue with profit of $11.2 billion, respective 31 percent and 53 percent year-over-year increases. As far as usage goes, Facebook is up all around, with more than 1.84 billion people using its main social network at least once a day in December 2020, an 11 percent year-over-year increase. As of December 31st, 2020, more than 2.8 billion people check Facebook at least once a month, a 12 percent jump from the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vDSQF"&gt;When measuring usage of its bundled family of apps that also includes Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp — a metric the company refers to as “family active people” — the numbers are even better, as usual. More than 2.6 billion people check one of Facebook’s apps every day (up 15 percent from 2019), while more than 3.3 billion check one of the apps at least once a month (up 14 percent). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0708f7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 3.3 billion people use a Facebook-owned app at least once a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SkhwjL"&gt;Facebook’s business was largely unaffected by its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560969/facebook-political-ad-ban-extended-trump-2020-election-concede-misinformation"&gt;decision in October to temporarily ban political advertising&lt;/a&gt; following the US election. (The company extended the ban by one month in December, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215067/facebook-ads-georgia-runoff-political-ad-ban-zuckerberg"&gt;exempted advertising for the Georgia Senate races&lt;/a&gt;.) That was to be expected; political advertising pales in comparison to e-commerce, standard retailer, and small business ad spend on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ual4Pc"&gt;Facebook’s “Other” category, which includes its Portal video chat devices and Oculus virtual reality business, also fared quite well last quarter, with a 156 percent jump in revenue to $885 million. Last quarter included the launch of Facebook’s second-generation wireless Quest headset, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, and Portal devices have seen surging sales all year as people shifted to remote work and virtual hangouts at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXvtXD"&gt;But it’s not all good news for Facebook looking ahead. The company says it will “continue to face significant uncertainty as we manage through a number of cross currents in 2021” in its earnings report, signaling concerns the company won’t be able to maintain the same pace of year-over-year growth as it enters the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqOtX2"&gt;Unsaid in its report are privacy changes from Apple that could have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;significant consequences for Facebook’s ad business&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;new mandated privacy labels&lt;/a&gt; and Apple’s upcoming plan to mandate app makers get user consent to track people on iOS devices. Earlier this month, Facebook’s WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delayed a new privacy policy update&lt;/a&gt; that was sending users fleeing the app for competitors like Signal and Telegram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpWrtm"&gt;“At the same time, in the first half of 2021, we will be lapping a period of growth that was negatively impacted by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic,” the company writes. “As a result, we expect year-over-year growth rates in total revenue to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially in the first and second quarters of 2021. In the second half of the year, we will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which will significantly pressure year-over-year growth rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WW2smV"&gt;Facebook also continues to weather its fair share of public relations and platform moderation controversies surrounding misinformation, election interference, and the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;banning of former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. That is in addition to a new wave of US regulatory scrutiny punctuated last month by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;unprecedented Federal Trade Commission lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; seeking to unwind the company’s pricey acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But those issues appear to have little effect whatsoever on the company’s bottom line, for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla unveils redesigned Model S with new interior and 520-mile range option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlpeiW1S3fx-qvr2tnNMT8spIBc=/398x0:3122x1816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730354/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_3.26.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l7PM7c"&gt;Tesla has just announced the first major redesign of the Model S since it &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-motors-begin-customer-deliveries-model-s-june-22nd"&gt;launched the electric sedan in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. This new version, which will launch later this year, has a refreshed exterior, a simplified interior, and the option for a more powerful powertrain that lets the car travel at least 520 miles and go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in under 2 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27sMyg"&gt;The new Model S has some light updates to the exterior of the car, but the biggest visual change is inside. Tesla has axed the portrait touchscreen in favor of one more like what’s found in the Model 3 and Model Y, though with much smaller bezels. There’s also a stalkless U-shaped steering wheel, much like what we’ve seen in the forthcoming second-generation Roadster, and a screen behind the center console for rear-seat passengers. Unlike the Model 3 and Model Y, the new Model S still features a screen behind the steering wheel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48aU1W"&gt;The new Model S starts at $79,990 for a “Long Range” dual-motor version that gets 412 miles of range. Or people can spend $119,000 for one with the new, more powerful “Plaid” powertrain that goes 390 miles with that sub-2 second 0–60 time. The “Plaid+” version with 520 miles starts at $139,000. The Plaid and Plaid+ versions have top speeds of 200 miles per hour, while the Long Range tops out at 155 mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2kzZuP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10306471"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XW7ms"&gt;A Model S redesign has been rumored for years, with &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/07/30/tesla-model-s-x-interior-refresh-exclusive-first-look/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posting allegedly leaked renders of the new interior all the way back in 2018. Tesla CEO Elon Musk threw cold water on the idea in 2019, though, when he tweeted “[t]here is no ‘refreshed’ Model X or Model S coming.” Tesla instead was constantly making minor improvements to both vehicles, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMDwOv"&gt;But that tune started to change once Tesla started testing out a new powertrain in 2019 dubbed “Plaid” — which, much like the “Ludicrous” acceleration mode in Tesla’s cars, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0"&gt;is a &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs &lt;/em&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMoTmY"&gt;Musk said at Tesla’s Battery Day event in September 2020 that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;Plaid Model S would be coming in late 2021&lt;/a&gt;. But aside from the basic specs, and the addition of the car to its website, Tesla didn’t mention anything about a design refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcEeQK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple surpasses $100 billion in quarterly revenue for first time in its history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F634QkTeHFCJIerV0S_RzB_RlYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730336/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRJ132"&gt;Apple today reported its fiscal Q1 2021 earnings, which cover the final calendar quarter of 2020 and the holiday sales season. That means this is the first time we’re getting a real indication of how the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; are faring with consumers. As it turns out, they’re doing very well. Apple crossed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the company’s history: it brought in $111.4 billion in total, with earnings per share of $1.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfT7Kw"&gt;The latest iPhones went on sale a bit later than normal, and Apple has had to again close some of its retail locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But despite those obstacles, the iPhone business did extraordinarily well, tallying over $65 billion in revenue. The previous all-time record for iPhone revenue in a quarter was $61.58 billion, which Apple hit in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SBoIW"&gt;Alongside a tweaked, flatter design, the iPhone 12 series is the first to include 5G mobile data, which some have speculated could result in a so-called “super cycle” of upgrades from people who are still using iPhones that are a couple years old at this point. The strong early interest is certainly there; now we’ll have to see if it holds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l89BnE"&gt;Apple’s Mac and iPad lines have seen rocketing sales during the prolonged period of working at home and remote education as a result of the pandemic. The momentum continued in this latest quarter, with iPad sales up a staggering 41 percent — during a holiday quarter, remember — and Mac sales up 21 percent year over year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU0ZELodKHp9OMSCN3xNlwzpPww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21975638/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPad sales were up a staggering 41 percent year over year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMFjtu"&gt;The company’s MacBook Air, base-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini are now powered by its own M1 processors. Those three products officially kicked off a transition away from Intel chips that will extend to Apple’s other Mac products over the coming months. The popular iPad Air was also updated in the fall with a more modern design similar to the iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwYsfe"&gt;Unsurprisingly, AirPods / AirPods Pro and the Apple Watch were a holiday hit for another year running, boosting the wearables division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMrAuy"&gt;Just as 2020 came to a close, Apple launched its latest paid subscription service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which joins Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple News Plus as ways of getting recurring profits from consumers who buy Apple hardware. The company has continued to extend the trial periods for some of those services — namely, Apple TV Plus — but the services unit as a whole continues to perform very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoLcF"&gt;Executive shifts at the company also continue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249393/apple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new"&gt;Just this week, Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that longtime hardware engineering SVP Dan Riccio will now focus on a new, unspecified project; John Ternus — who has publicly introduced well-received products like the revamped Mac Pro, iPad Pro, and M1 Macs — has replaced him as Apple’s hardware boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZjbN2"&gt;The company has also pushed forward with its social initiatives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;announcing a number of racial equity investments&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;removed conservative social media app Parler&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store, citing insufficient moderation policies and calls to violence from some users on the app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla turns Model Y and China success into its first ever annual profit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZMonKuEmKkBzKVcwOM8D6A-QUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730272/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pbmxqi"&gt;Tesla’s record sales in 2020 helped the Silicon Valley company turn its first annual profit, according to financial figures released Wednesday, though not by much. Aided by a fourth quarter that brought in $270 million in profit on $10.7 billion of revenue, Tesla finished 2020 with a $721 million in profit on $31.5 billion in total revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrX8K7"&gt;To help get over the line, Tesla booked $401 million in regulatory credit sales in the fourth quarter of 2020. The company generates this money by selling these credits to automakers that make fewer clean vehicles than are required by the US government and the European Union. The credit sales have come in handy the past year and a half, as they’ve generated hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter for Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="677jV6"&gt;Tesla shipped 180,667 vehicles total in the fourth quarter, and 161,701 of those were Model 3s and Model Ys. Ultimately, Tesla delivered 499,647 in 2020 — a few more than it estimated earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;but still ever so shy of the goal of 500,000&lt;/a&gt; for the year. Still, it’s quite the accomplishment considering that Tesla had to deal with prolonged shutdowns at both of its automotive factories in California and China due to the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pFzRig"&gt;Tesla’s banner 2020 was bolstered by booming sales of the new Model Y SUV and increased success in the Chinese market after opening a factory there early in the year. Those developments, coupled with the continued success of the Model 3, helped Tesla absorb &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/vw-tops-tesla-in-bounce-back-year-for-europe-s-auto-incumbents"&gt;losing market share in Europe to the Volkswagen Group&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted multiple electric vehicles on its home continent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4feycj"&gt;Sustainable profitability had always eluded Tesla, in large part because the company spent much of its first decade trying to grow bigger. When the Model S sedan first went on sale, Tesla was already working on the more complex and more expensive Model X SUV. By the time that hit the market, Tesla had started work on the more affordable Model 3 sedan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8XUrQ"&gt;Tesla turned a slight profit in the third quarter of 2016, not long after the Model X hit the market. But Model 3 development put the company back in the red. Trouble with Model 3 production kept it there until things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203886/tesla-earnings-q1-revenue-profit-record-model-3"&gt;started to smooth out in the second half of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Tesla to turn back-to-back quarterly profits for the first time in what the company called its “most pivotal year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g68Xvi"&gt;After two more quarters in the red to start 2019, Tesla has remained profitable ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jY5fZ"&gt;A stable business is a good thing for Tesla’s future, but the company’s performance was also rewarded mightily in the stock market in 2020. Its share price skyrocketed last year, making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;Musk the richest man in the world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286562/tesla-stock-most-valuable-automaker-slot-as-more-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;Tesla the most valuable automaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1YuDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about the tech systems behind the US’s vaccine distribution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GoZ5BaEoZZGWRhshupvHyBYe1XU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730224/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gj3ZqK"&gt;There are many moving parts involved in the Biden administration’s goal to administer 100 million vaccine doses in its first 100 days. Boatloads of data need to flow between manufacturers, health agencies, state officials, and local clinics. An article by Cat Ferguson and Karen Hao, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/27/1016790/covid-vaccine-distribution-us/"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; today&lt;/a&gt;, lays out each step of vaccine distribution and explains the hurdles that come up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqV4Uc"&gt;At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services uses a Palantir-designed system called Tiberius to plan vaccine allocation. At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s VTrckS helps states order vaccines. Both digital systems are constantly being fed data from a variety of sources. The number-crunching involves census data, reports of which areas have clusters of health care workers and elderly people, and information about which places have cold freezers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4z2pV"&gt;“When thinking about the utility of the system, it’s worth noting that many health departments have a shallow bench of tech-savvy employees who can easily navigate data-heavy systems,” Ferguson and Hao wrote. In addition to Tiberius and VTrckS, there are dozens of other technical systems at play, and some clinic workers are still entering vaccination records by hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNDJta"&gt;Actually getting the vaccines into people’s arms is the trickiest part. There’s a mixed bag of systems across jurisdictions for scheduling vaccinations and keeping track of who’s been vaccinated. Scheduling through an online system requires &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;digital literacy that not all elderly people possess&lt;/a&gt;, and call centers set up as alternatives are quickly overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtRBE6"&gt;There’s a lot of technological coordination going into the difficult task of vaccine distribution. To get a fuller picture of all the systems at work, read the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/27/1016790/covid-vaccine-distribution-us/"&gt;full article here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Baidu is the sixth company approved to test fully driverless cars in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVK_kt2aIeFzuDwoaVY9MwcSUW4=/0x0:950x633/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730143/baidu.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Baidu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8j1vv"&gt;Baidu has gotten the green light to test fully autonomous vehicles on public roads in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jm4LrN"&gt;The Chinese search giant is the sixth company to receive a fully autonomous testing permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (the others being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517833/cruise-driverless-cars-test-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044670/waymo-fully-driverless-car-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/zoox-becomes-fourth-company-to-land-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/"&gt;Zoox&lt;/a&gt;, and AutoX). Currently, 60 companies have an active permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MnN90z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Baidu is the leading Chinese company in the autonomous vehicle space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWI0LV"&gt;Baidu, which already spent years working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923966/baidu-apollo-self-driving-car-platform-ford-intel-nvidia"&gt;self-driving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15352462/baidu-project-apollo-self-driving-cars-autonomous"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, is the leading Chinese company in the autonomous vehicle space. Last September, the company demonstrated its Level 4 fully autonomous vehicles at its developer conference, Baidu World. In December, Baidu &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/baidu-driverless-road-tests-beijing-china-autonomous-183933093.html"&gt;received the first license&lt;/a&gt; to test fully autonomous vehicles on public roads in China. The city of Beijing granted the company permission to test five of its self-driving Apollo vehicles, which are retrofitted Lincoln MKZs and Chrysler Pacificas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntGZY0"&gt;While Baidu has had permission from California regulators to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers since 2016, the new permit allows the company to test three autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within Sunnyvale, located in Santa Clara County. The vehicles are only allowed on roads with speed limits of 45 mph, and they can operate day or night but not during inclement weather like fog or rain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R14jcZ"&gt;Companies that receive these driverless permits have to provide evidence of insurance or a bond equal to $5 million and follow several other rules, such as training remote operators on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQD4MM"&gt;Baidu recently announced plans to make electric vehicles with help from Geely, the country’s largest private automaker and the parent company of Volvo. Specifically, Baidu and Geely are in talks to use the latter’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-geely-electric/geely-launches-electric-vehicle-manufacturing-platform-idUKKCN26E1ZN"&gt;scalable electric vehicle platform&lt;/a&gt; that it announced late last year. But Baidu will own a majority stake in the new company and will therefore control its direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So you got a 5G phone, but is your plan ready? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_lwL3NUDvxHGb7l3SNRe6r20AM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68580559/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;5G in the US isn’t mind-bogglingly fast, but it is going to get better | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Your guide to the current state of 5G carrier plans in the US, what they cost, and whether it’s worth upgrading your plan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0STAxL"&gt;You’re the proud owner of a new 5G phone — congratulations! We’ve got some bad news, though: if you live in the US, 5G &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/study-finds-that-us-5g-speeds-are-slower-than-14-other-countries"&gt;probably isn’t going to be the mind-bogglingly fast experience&lt;/a&gt; that you’ve been promised. For most regions, it’s just a little faster than the 4G speeds we’re used to using. But here’s the good news: 5G is going to get better, so if you have a 5G phone you may want to make sure your plan delivers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUbp57"&gt;If you got a phone recently, there’s a good chance it supports 5G. Pretty much every new phone in 2021 — with the exception of some budget models — will offer some form of 5G support. Whatever your preferred brand or operating system, 5G is coming your way soon if you don’t have it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ylmN"&gt;Your phone is ready for the next big thing, but what about your data plan? Across the board, the major US carriers’ unlimited plans already include access to 5G. However, carriers offer a mix of 5G bands that vary in speed and coverage. It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ov9vPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s complicated, as all things 5G have been since it first appeared in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AeQgSC"&gt;Consider this your guide to the current state of 5G and data plans in the US — which ones include 5G, which don’t, what variety of 5G they include, and whether you should consider upgrading depending on your carrier’s implementation of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7M860"&gt;One important note for those with a 5G phone: even if you discover that your current plan does include 5G and it’s available in your area, you may still need to upgrade to a new SIM card if you moved it over from an older device. A SIM card that was activated in a 4G device will still work with a 5G device, but you may have trouble connecting to the 5G network. Check with your carrier if you’re not seeing the little 5G logo pop up on your screen and you think you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6877V"&gt;For comparison purposes, the prices listed in this article are for one line of service per month before taxes and fees. Additional lines bring down the monthly cost per line, but your total bill increases, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5eQLb4"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ySFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Unless you live in one of the few areas with Verizon’s truly fast UW 5G, we don’t think there’s a reason to change your plan just yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yeRjtT"&gt;Verizon offers two varieties of 5G, the faster of which it calls “Ultra Wideband” (also referred to as millimeter wave or mmWave) and is available only in certain parts of certain cities. It’s scarce, but it is mind-bogglingly fast, and you’ll see a 5G UW logo on your phone screen if your phone is using that network. Oh, and 5G UW signals don’t reach indoors for the most part, so if you’re spending most of your time inside your house or apartment right now, you probably wouldn’t pick it up even if you live in a place where it’s available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="vsmFJ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ultra Wideband is scarce but mind-bogglingly fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="AxSy3H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDLVU"&gt;“Nationwide” is the company’s other 5G, a low-band variety that’s slower than mmWave but offers much broader coverage. In fact, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/heres-why-verizon-iphone-users-must-turn-off-5g-right-now"&gt;sometimes a bit slower than 4G&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not happy with the 5G speeds you’re getting, you may want to try limiting your phone to LTE and see if things improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc9Ye8"&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s coverage map&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s available in your area. If you do live in a city with UW 5G, be sure to zoom &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the way in to see the exact areas and streets with coverage — they’re marked in a darker shade of red that will appear once you zoom in close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt3rAT"&gt;Verizon’s Shared Data (data capped) plans and its $80-per-month basic unlimited plan include the lower-tier Nationwide 5G only. For access to UW in addition to Nationwide 5G, you’ll need at least the $90 “Play More” unlimited plan. Verizon offers $10 off those monthly prices if you enroll in auto pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkrFa3"&gt;Verizon also includes Nationwide 5G on its prepaid data plans, which start at $75 per month for unlimited data or $40 per month for a 5GB data-capped plan. The most expensive unlimited plan also includes UW 5G as of early 2021. There’s a $5 monthly discount for auto pay as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H6XaJU"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGY28e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: Don’t worry about switching up your AT&amp;amp;T plan for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Rje9sa"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s history with 5G is… fraught. Early on, the company marketed what was essentially LTE technology as “5G E” and (rightfully) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;caught a lot of flak for it&lt;/a&gt;. You won’t see that term in any of the company’s marketing these days, but AT&amp;amp;T customers still might see a 5G E logo on their phone screen when connected to this service. If you do see it, know that what you’re getting is not really 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0HVlL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="gXk39F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6XNQm"&gt;Outside of that debacle, AT&amp;amp;T has invested in its true 5G offerings, which are structured similarly to Verizon’s: a fast mmWave version called 5G Plus in limited places and slower but more widespread standard 5G coverage. However, 5G Plus may be even more scarce than Verizon’s UW 5G. The company doesn’t provide any coverage maps for it, and it says only that it is deployed in “select innovation zones” in parts of certain cities. Testers for &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/fastest-mobile-networks/2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual mobile network test&lt;/a&gt; didn’t encounter 5G Plus in cities where AT&amp;amp;T offers it. The carrier’s standard 5G is of the low-band variety similar to Verizon’s Nationwide, and &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; testers also found that it sometimes lagged behind 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCcuum"&gt;All of this is to say that AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G really isn’t worth upgrading your plan for yet, but if you’re on any of the company’s unlimited plans, you wouldn’t need to anyway. Both 5G and 5G Plus are included in all postpaid unlimited plans, which start at $75 per month ($65 with auto pay). The Unlimited Plus prepaid plan also includes it at $75 per month ($60 with auto pay). AT&amp;amp;T’s only postpaid 4GB data-capped plan doesn’t include 5G and neither do its other prepaid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNimDg"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T may have had a somewhat rocky start with 5G, but the technology will improve. And for now at least, the company isn’t charging a premium for its fastest 5G variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5N4Cb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fmaps%2Fwireless-coverage.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZW3lLd"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z7bVnx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All of T-Mobile’s postpaid and prepaid plans include 5G. If you’re on the base postpaid unlimited plan and live in a congested area you might find you have more reliable access to 5G by upgrading. But no need if you don’t notice slowdowns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PxCgUp"&gt;Of the three big carriers, T-Mobile might be in the best position to bring truly faster-than-LTE 5G to the most people — but it doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s efforts have been concentrated around high and low-band offerings. T-Mobile offers both, too, but it’s also working on converting Sprint’s former midband frequencies to 5G. This might be a sweet spot: not as fast as the mmWave stuff, but genuinely faster than 4G. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;Recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; shows the network isn’t delivering on that promise just yet, but T-Mobile promised to extend midband 5G to 100 million people by the end of this year and doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpSW0x"&gt;All of the company’s postpaid plans include 5G, starting with the $65 per month ($60 with autopay) Essentials plan. One caveat: customers on that base-level plan are the first ones subject to slowdowns when the network is congested. T-Mobile also offers 5G on its prepaid plans for both unlimited and data-capped options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="wjFqsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10248478"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFa17r"&gt;For now, we think T-Mobile customers can stay put on their current plan. Essentials plan customers who are happy with their network speeds and don’t notice slowdowns probably wouldn’t gain much from upgrading just yet. But it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile can make good on its ambitious promises to bring meaningfully fast 5G to more of its customers in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA0ipT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile 5G coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m4L2q7"&gt;US Cellular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tQnXJX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: All plans (pre- and postpaid) include access to 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJEhwO"&gt;US Cellular 5G is of the low-band variety, so it’s still only a little faster than 4G. But the good news is if you’re on US Cellular, you have access to the company’s 5G: all plans (pre- and postpaid) include it. And if you’re in a rural area, US Cellular is more likely to offer 5G to you now, while major carriers’ coverage is still mostly concentrated around bigger cities. So there’s not much to deliberate here, if you have a 5G phone and your area is covered, you should be able to connect. We just wouldn’t advise anyone to switch to US Cellular only because it offers 5G where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xH1tu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uscellular.com%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22194419%2F5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US Cellular coverage map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x37LzS"&gt;MVNOs: Cricket, Metro by T-Mobile, etc.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jpsQGR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR: If you’re happy with your MVNO plan, don’t switch things up just for 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAFgq4"&gt;Most mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, do include 5G on their plans. Cricket’s unlimited plan offers 5G access using AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network ($60 per month for one line). All Mint Mobile plans include access to 5G on T-Mobile’s network, and Metro by T-Mobile prepaid plans come with 5G access, starting with a 10GB plan for $40 / month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rpGfnM"&gt;A significant caveat though: since MVNOs don’t own the networks they use, carrier subscribers are likely to get preferential treatment when there’s congestion. If you’re looking for the best of the best speeds, one of the big three might be the way to go. But again, that reality is still a ways off. Chances are, you wouldn’t be upgrading to a night-and-day experience if you did switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gExXvj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that only T-Mobile’s postpaid plans offer 5G. T-Mobile in fact offers 5G on all of its prepaid and postpaid plans. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgbGhl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27, 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon has added a new prepaid unlimited plan that includes UW 5G access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is bringing iCloud Keychain support to Chrome for Windows, but it’s not ready yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the iCloud for Windows screen, with the new Passwords option" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-nIWteYCLVk6VBGmLagEqcjXcU=/0x16:732x504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729981/IMAGE_2021_01_27_11_57_45.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gUsvQp"&gt;Users caught between Apple and Microsoft may now have an easier time managing passwords: it looks like iCloud Keychain is coming to Windows 10 as a Chrome extension (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/icloud-windows-chrome-extension-icloud-passwords"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It’s already in the iCloud for Windows 10 app, but there’s just one small problem: the Chrome Extension isn’t available yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSTGnx"&gt;The latest version of iCloud for Windows 10 includes “Support for iCloud Passwords Chrome Extension” in the list of new features, and when you open the app, there’s a new Passwords-syncing option. Checking the box will cause a login prompt to come up, along with a request for two-factor authentication. According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201391"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll need to have two-factor turned on for your account to have access to the feature, which is probably a good choice since, in theory, you’re going to be syncing all of your passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gTH8R"&gt;I say “in theory” because after you log in again, you’re prompted to download the iCloud Passwords extension for Chrome. However, the download button just takes you to a 404 page, and searching the Chrome Web Store for the extension doesn’t turn up anything. It seems like Apple may have launched the iCloud for Windows update a little prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Windows dialog box informing the user that they have to download the iCloud Passwords extension" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BMA4uLh9mA_9pJ19FkITpZYUm2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263750/2021_01_27_11_24_39_iCloud.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Google 404 page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cub8Mt4bQ5UiDkS2QUy4DPaJXyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263749/2021_01_27_11_29_56_Error_404__Not_Found___1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not the extension I was promised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IVMwWE"&gt;Hopefully the Chrome extension will be available soon, as having access to iCloud Keychain on Windows would make life a lot easier for people who use it on their iPhones, iPads, or Macs. However, if you simply can’t wait, you could always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;switch to a dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, moving all of your passwords would be a pain if you’re already using iCloud Keychain, so you may be better off just waiting a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Memes have broken the brokerages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O8-wE0wT01cHBQ0UBkFXvfpBh10=/0x0:4015x2677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68729939/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezPUBA"&gt;In retrospect, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;stock memes were inevitable&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it looks like a lot of brokerages weren’t ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qy25dD"&gt;Vanguard, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity Investments, among others, have been experiencing outages, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/outages-continue-to-plague-online-brokerages-11611768827"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. None of the brokerages would tell the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;specifically why the outages were happening. Also, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade are restricting trading around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;, as individual investors pile into these companies, &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjeIQs"&gt;See, GameStop stock rose an astounding 1,600 percent &lt;em&gt;in January alone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; points out. What happened is a little complex, but basically boils down to traders gathering on Reddit, Discord, and elsewhere to encourage others to buy call options on the stock. The internet’s exuberance over GameStop has also affected AMC, Bed Bath and Beyond, BlackBerry, Tootsie Roll, and other companies. The trading action has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-day-trader-army-fattens-fortunes-of-world-s-super-rich"&gt;further enriched some of the world’s richest people&lt;/a&gt;. It has also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/yellen-monitoring-gamestop-market-activity-psaki-says"&gt;caught the attention&lt;/a&gt; of Janet Yellen, the US Treasury secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHQR2N"&gt;Over the last decade, most of us have seen the power that social networks can bring to bear on politics, for instance, and media. Now, social networks are disrupting finance. The pandemic has more people day trading — 2020 was a record high in the volume of individual trading, Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities, told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;And collectives of retail traders can use platforms such as Discord, Twitch, and Reddit to coordinate their actions in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpISNX"&gt;Until recently, it was hard to imagine that doing a trade would be as easy as posting to Instagram, but here we are. And what’s more, trading is cheaper than ever — free at many brokerages — reducing further the amount of confidence an investor might need in a stock to buy options on it. Right now, Robinhood, a broker that allows free trades on stocks and options, is the most popular free app in Apple’s App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPrZoD"&gt;The result of this frenzy is what appears to be a massive casino, but investors beware: at a casino, the house always wins.&lt;/p&gt;
