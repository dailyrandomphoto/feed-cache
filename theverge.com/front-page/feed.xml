  &lt;p&gt;A handy guide for finding the best stuff released this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HnjRwo"&gt;As Netflix has become more ubiquitous, it’s also become more of a challenge to sift through the seemingly never-ending list of shows on the service. There’s a lot, from reality shows about questionable animal tycoons to a plethora of video game adaptations. Sure, the really big stuff rises to the top — &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, etc. — but there’s also a lot that’s easy to miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NoHH3b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10927726"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5PAjHN"&gt;
&lt;p id="EU2xJw"&gt;Lucky for you, I spend far too much time keeping up with the latest releases and have come back with 10 series that should definitely add to your Netflix rotation: everything from grisly horror to comfort food sitcoms to cozy post-apocalypses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thsOic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="D7zsVb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Svs_hl897c?rel=0&amp;amp;start=43" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1o8oiH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is a series based on the long-running game &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, but you don’t have to know a thing about the game to enjoy it. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;this slick animated show&lt;/a&gt; actually serves as a great introduction to &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; and its steampunk-meets-fantasy universe. The story follows a handful of characters in a bustling city that’s quickly changing thanks to a new technology that can harness the power of magic. Things move at a rapid pace, making it great for binging, and oh, my goodness, is the animation &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt;. This might be the best-looking animated project since &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse&lt;/em&gt;. And once you do finish, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22815884/league-of-legends-ruined-king-rpg"&gt;there’s a brand-new &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; RPG that’s a perfect follow-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="uvch3Y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bXxwLH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="cf16Mp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqxAJKy0ii4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K2eOwX"&gt;If you haven’t actually watched &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; yet, you’re likely at least aware of it. The show was &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, from social media to Halloween costumes — and with good reason. The story follows a disturbing competition where hundreds of players, all struggling financially, compete at various children’s games for a chance at a huge cash prize. The twist is that the games are all deadly, and making it to the end means being the sole survivor. What follows is a grisly indictment of class and capitalism and also just a really great show that will keep you on edge the entire time. At least you’ll have some time to catch your breath &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772170/squid-game-season-two-netflix-director-confirms"&gt;before season 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pSIZDB"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BJt1kd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellbound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="a0XL9w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWfgm20-LTM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hlcS2j"&gt;Show titles don’t get much more literal than &lt;em&gt;Hellbound&lt;/em&gt;. The show is about a mysterious phenomenon in which angel-like creatures start appearing before people, telling them that they’re bound for hell. Even worse, they’re given a specific time so they know exactly how long they have left to live. When that time hits, terrifying monsters attack, resulting in some very bloody deaths. These grisly episodes are at the heart of the show, but they’re also mostly an excuse to explore deeper questions about everything from the power of religion to internet-fueled mobs. &lt;em&gt;Hellbound &lt;/em&gt;also doesn’t overstay its welcome: at just six episodes long, it’s prime binge material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9J24i9"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BuBYv8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="WID1Lc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJFVV2L8GKs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7OYqK0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;’s first season&lt;/a&gt; helped solidify it as one of the best dark fantasy epics around, combining political intrigue and scary monsters with lots of sex and humor. It was tense and bloody but also a lot of fun. Now we have a second season, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826460/witcher-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;which leans a little more towards the serious side&lt;/a&gt;, but still manages to be a great watch thanks to the incredible cast, led by the gruff-as-always Geralt, played by Henry Cavill. And the franchise keeps growing: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;there’s an animated prequel out now&lt;/a&gt; and a live-action spinoff starring Michelle Yeoh on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="klwVzh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VsEUSy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nailed It&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="wKTiIV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgHdBTeloek?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U22pNH"&gt;Sometimes you just need to turn off your brain, and there are few better ways of doing that than watching comedian Nicole Byers and chef Jacque Torres host a competition for the world’s worst bakers. What makes &lt;em&gt;Nailed It&lt;/em&gt; work so well, beyond the undeniable chemistry of its hosts, is that everyone is in on the joke, so you never feel guilty laughing when someone serves a mushy pile of icing that’s supposed to be a cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QFudFA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3RfUEw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="bfDHEw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zG9RuJb3QU?rel=0&amp;amp;start=36" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yb7EIf"&gt;There are a lot of post-apocalyptic shows, and the vast majority are grim and depressing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22518583/netflix-sweet-tooth-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; mostly avoids this&lt;/a&gt;. Partially, that’s due to the Americana vibe, which almost makes the end of the world seem cozy. But most of it comes down to the main character Sweet Tooth himself. The show’s version of the apocalypse begins when a sickness wipes out much of the population, coinciding with the mysterious appearance of animal-human hybrids. The story follows Sweet Tooth, a young boy with antlers whose wide-eyed curiosity and infectious cheer make it impossible not to root for him. The show is still dark and often uncomfortable, but it has just enough hope to make it tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sBbZtb"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nOi8DJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brand New Cherry Flavor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="vYGBcM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOzM3c33TVg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKfxn1"&gt;If there is an opposite of comfort viewing, that would be &lt;em&gt;Brand New Cherry Flavor&lt;/em&gt;. The horror series follows a budding director who turns to a witch in order to get revenge on a backstabbing producer. From there, things just get increasingly more horrifying but in a way that’s hard to look away from. &lt;em&gt;Brand New Cherry Flavor&lt;/em&gt; particularly excels when it comes to body horror; there are a handful of disturbing scenes that will stick with you long after you finish watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UxXl99"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VJD8Lh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="quQLYi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmgYlYw7Uwk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VXEmBY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt; is one of the rare high school dramas that just keeps getting better. The show is ostensibly about a therapist, played by Gillian Anderson, and her son, as they (separately) help just about everyone around them with sex-related problems. But from that simple premise, the show has blossomed to be one of the most frank and diverse explorations of sexuality on television. It’s a joy to watch these characters grow over time, and the new third season does an amazing job of introducing plenty of change without getting away from what makes the show work so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bZELqA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mdM94o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="k8usMy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-XIRcjf3l4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hT19IY"&gt;Director Mike Flanagan has had an incredible run of horror anthologies on Netflix. It started with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, continued with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haunting of Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683761/midnight-mass-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The latest series has plenty that will be familiar to fans of his work — a troubled family, mysterious supernatural elements, oh-so-long monologues — but it also takes a turn to more straight-up horror. It takes a little while to get going, but when &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; eventually ramps up, it becomes an exquisite mix of scares and heartbreak that reaches a fever pitch with a truly wild and bloody final episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5GBYFR"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L1T94p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="BFva5h"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQXKyIG_NS4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VUBVqJ"&gt;What’s the deal with classic sitcoms on streaming services? While original series are typically what define a streamer, older shows are also a big part of the business. That’s why Netflix made such a big deal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652391/seinfeld-netflix-october-streaming-wars-friends-the-office"&gt;bringing every episode of &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; to the service earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. And for a show that’s very much a product of the ’90s, it manages to stand up pretty well in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704399/seinfeld-aspect-ratio-netflix-4k-widescreen-letterbox-streaming-hd"&gt;so long as you aren’t too bothered about aspect ratios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cvCVTo"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uWk3yF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call My Agent!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmWsaRROctIeqPuQ6Yl9SPRdwxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23101239/1281823_4_459500.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call My Agent!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JNzfJx"&gt;Netflix has lately been featuring a number of series from non-English-speaking countries, and one of the most fun is &lt;em&gt;Call My Agent!&lt;/em&gt; This French comedy takes us through four seasons of the trials and tribulations of a Paris talent firm as they deal with rambunctious movie stars (played as caricatured versions of themselves by the real actors), difficult love affairs, and desperate attempts to keep their floundering agency afloat. The series (originally called &lt;em&gt;Dix pour cent&lt;/em&gt; or “Ten percent”) has been so successful that it’s spawned a couple of knock-offs and an upcoming fifth season. &lt;em&gt;(Barbara Krasnoff)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GeoGuessr made figuring out where on Earth you are the hottest new esport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A collage of famous landmarks (Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum), confusing signage, and maps." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JBPuRr9uQ2PW8unzOFS5GOrsPCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70301051/acastro_211216_4930_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The years-old browser game became a competitive thrill this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0561oB"&gt;The camera-mounted Google truck that drove through South Africa’s Kruger National Park is equipped with a distinct, camo-green paint job and a pair of white racks resting on its rooftop. The car can’t be found anywhere else on Earth; so, if you pan down and see its blurry edges on Street View, you know that you’re somewhere within a 7,523 square mile radius north of Eswatini and west of Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOzq2N"&gt;This is a completely useless piece of trivia for everyone except those who take &lt;a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/"&gt;the browser game &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; very, very seriously — and more people are joining those ranks every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hq818"&gt;The game is simple. In each round, a player is dropped at a random location on Google Street View’s wide, interlocking atlas, potentially anywhere across the globe. Using only the context clues gleaned from the surrounding fauna, climate, billboards, and language, players are challenged to identify their coordinates on a map as accurately as they can and, in certain competitive settings, as fast as they can. So, at the highest levels of cutthroat metagaming ambition, the contours of the Kruger National Park’s truck becomes vital information — a way to separate the pros from the hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="og52mJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uh4guW7aYXc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwBH94"&gt;“You might not see that car again for two years playing the game,” says RadoX1988, one of the moderators of &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr’s&lt;/em&gt; competitive subreddit, who asks to be referred to by his online pseudonym. “But if you can remember it, over a long period of time, that becomes a massive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2PGSI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; was never designed to be played at high stakes. The game arrived in 2013 as a freeware project authored by a Swedish IT professional named Anton Wallén, right as Google was working to fill in the gaps to worldwide camera coverage. (“Was fiddling around with backbone and Google maps API v3 and decided to make a small application. Would appreciate your feedback/suggestions?” wrote Wallén on an ancient &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1clk3h/was_fiddling_around_with_backbone_and_google_maps/"&gt;Reddit thread unveiling GeoGuessr’s original incarnation.&lt;/a&gt;) It became one of those enduring social media curios — something you showed your mom on winter break. The idea that anyone would grind away at Wallén’s invention in the same way that top &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; guilds plowed through raid bosses was totally ludicrous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="S8Mz8Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pro players can “find out where they are based on the road, the sun, the environment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="whIwdr"&gt;And yet, scores of subscribers now log on YouTube to watch &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; semi-pros like Tom Davies, aka GeoWizard, who’ve trained long and hard to become oracular, all-seeing masters of Google Street View. It’s incredible to watch him cook. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh4guW7aYXc"&gt;Davies plops into a bustling flea market&lt;/a&gt;, pans the camera around, and sees the abbreviation “KSI” on a banner. “Does that stand for Kumasi?” a city in central Ghana. He pins down his location with omnipotent precision. (“2.2 miles away, fair enough,” he says.) A few minutes later, Davies touches down on a tranquil river and investigates a few highway signs bearing some telltale script: “I think this is Montenegro.” He comes within five yards of an exact match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV5Wk6"&gt;Davies is the harbinger of one of the most unexpected trends in gaming. In 2021, more than 240,000 people follow the &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr &lt;/em&gt;tag on Twitch, and a casual competition in late October, hosted by the French player AntoineDaniel, earned over 100,000 views. At a time when the future of the esports industry is in flux — with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/esports/2021/04/12/esports-investments-spacs/"&gt;economists warning of market corrections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.esports.net/news/overwatch-league-is-haemorrhaging-viewers-and-sponsors/"&gt;high-profile leagues teetering on the brink&lt;/a&gt; — plenty of young players discovered that nothing in video games rivals the drama of scouring a map as the timer ticks down, unsure if you’re in either Vietnam or Cambodia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6cJg7"&gt;RadoX1988 isn’t sure how all of this happened. When he started participating in the &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; subreddit in 2017, there were only about 10 users actively competing. “We all just played the daily challenge together, and that was it,” he says. Participation grew slowly through the end of 2020, when suddenly, a huge swathe of fresh blood poured into the community, eager to showcase their topographic aptitude. RadoX1988 speculates that a zeitgeist circled around &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr’s&lt;/em&gt; newly launched “Battle Royale” mode — translating the anxious, one-vs-all bedlam of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; into the sedate act of map-pointing — which hit live servers last winter. “That made &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; mainstream for the first time,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of GeoGuessr showing a road, a tree, some buildings, and power lines. Google Street View controls let the player manipulate the game. A map in the bottom right corner lets players guess where they are." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/auqc6QucgPDAVQvPHVEc0diG5fQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115692/Screen_Shot_2021_12_20_at_3.29.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;GeoGuessr gives you Street View controls, a map, and the challenge of figuring out where on Earth you are.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClNMo0"&gt;Filip Antell, head of communications at &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt;, says he welcomes the newly energized cast of pin-droppers tearing up the game. The team released a “Pro Leagues” function, where players can create their own round-robin competitions among invitees. They’ve also put together a “Career Mode” with daily challenges and experience points, which evokes the enveloping progression systems you might find in &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike, &lt;/em&gt;nudging &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; closer to esports terrain. “When you look at the pro players that can be dropped anywhere in the world and actually find out where they are based on the road, the sun, the environment, it’s really jaw-dropping,” says Antell. “And I believe that when you see someone being able to differentiate and excel in that, it also encourages you to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9X1TXS"&gt;There’s no centralized competitive infrastructure in &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; — nobody battles in this game while swaddled in plush, nylon FaZe Clan jerseys — so those invested in the art of atlas combat must create their own rivals. Anyone can host a tournament, and they come in all sorts of different flavors. There’s an ongoing Reddit League, complete with a stringent regular season that ranks players on their win/loss records before eventually crowning a winner and relegating the bottom-feeders. Each week, the Street View action goes down in a distinct region (Germany, Guatemala, Saskatchewan), accentuating the versatility necessary for longitudinal superiority. “You have to be serious about it and play on the regular,” says RadoX1988. There is also a “World Cup” challenge, in which players compete head to head in “home” and “away” games. The first match takes place in one player’s chosen country, the second in the other’s backyard, like a summer series between the Yankees and Red Sox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="S2Xg7I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is very hard for organizers to be able to prevent cheating.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPqBGM"&gt;That said, there are rarely any prizes on the line in high-level &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; play. Zotomo, a tournament organizer in Japan, tells me champions will occasionally receive a small trophy or a &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; Prime subscription — which guarantees an unlimited number of free games on the platform. But for the most part, the only reward is bragging rights. This is the nature of the beast. &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; is a free browser game with no security safeguards or automated pit bosses, explains Zotomo. That makes it easy for someone to open a surreptitious tab and Google the name of whatever street they happen to land on, totally derailing the spirit of sportsmanship. “It is very hard for organizers to be able to prevent cheating,” says Zotomo. “So no serious prizes can be given away without a lot of issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kF9bKT"&gt;It’s the elephant in the room and perhaps the only barrier facing &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; as it continues to stretch its legs as a nascent esport. Wallén developed this game on the back of data scraped directly from Google, and as such, &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; headquarters will never be fully in control of its servers. Does that rule out a timeline full of LAN events, cash prizes, and all the pageantry we associate with the modern esports industry? Not necessarily. “Having an official &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr Masters&lt;/em&gt; would be really interesting to set up in the future,” says Antell. “If one can dream.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="fysyHu"&gt;I understand his optimism. The &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; team has already beaten the odds by proving that a geography game can exist in the same competitive atmosphere as &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. Scores of players are pouring in, all of whom are eager to demonstrate how quickly they can identify the trucks of Kruger National Park. With just the sun, the mountains, and a handful of road signs, the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This security researcher fooled an at-home COVID-19 test using a Bluetooth hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qvBiYR7p7g7U4elz1kP2CFUgDDI=/42x0:1092x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70300934/img_product_consumer02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Researchers were able to exploit Ellume’s at-home test.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ellume&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1xB3S"&gt;A security researcher was able to change the results of an at-home COVID test and get those results certified by intercepting and modifying Bluetooth traffic from the device before it reached the app. The researcher, Ken Gannon, found the flaw in Ellume’s nasal swab test, which is designed to analyze and transmit data to a companion app which displays and saves the results. According to a press release from F-Secure, the security company Gannon consults for, Ellume has now fixed the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JqBt3"&gt;The process of falsifying results wasn’t a simple one — according to F-Secure’s writeup, the researcher used a rooted Android device to tap into and analyze the data the tester was sending to the app. From there, Gannon was able to determine how the results were sent, and how their authenticity was verified. Then, he wrote two scripts that were able to successfully change a negative result into a positive one. When he got an email with his results from Ellume, he says, it incorrectly showed he had tested positive. If you’re interested in the technical details, you can &lt;a href="https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/faking-a-positive-covid-test"&gt;read the writeup here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iWnpUY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ellume says it’s followed recommendations to make this type of exploit harder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BXstvC"&gt;Ellume says it followed F-Secure’s recommendations to do more analysis to ensure that data was accurate, and made changes to the app that should make it harder to analyze its data or take over the data transmission. Gannon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that he didn’t test to see if his research was applicable to the iOS version of the app, and that the goal of his research was “to see if an ‘average person’ can fake a positive/negative COVID test.” He said that, in theory, “a dedicated threat actor could use [his] research to modify the Ellume app to always report a positive / negative result,” which could be installed on a non-rooted phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTYLpU"&gt;While Gannon’s writeup only includes changing negative results to positive ones, he says in F-Secure’s press release that “the process works both ways.” Before Ellume’s patches, Gannon says that “someone with the proper motivation and technical skills could’ve used these flaws to ensure they, or someone they’re working with, gets a negative result every time they’re tested.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a41Vxq"&gt;In theory, a fake certification could be submitted to meet US re-entry requirements. Not only was F-Secure able to get an incorrect result certified, it did so without &lt;a href="https://www.azova.com/testing/ellume/"&gt;a video test supervisor&lt;/a&gt; being able to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgG0gR"&gt;The press release says Ellume is now working on a “verification portal” that will let authorities verify that its at-home tests are authentic, and has gone back to analyze all its previous results for accuracy. Ellume says it found that none of them had been faked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s big holiday update adds TikTok and playable Sonic the Hedgehog  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Tesla Model 3 interior is displayed with a Sega Genesis game controller sitting under the infotainment screen with a window on the screen showing the game Sonic 1." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_UD039NLuQ9srYlRdeWAJUoMeAQ=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70300924/IMG_0936.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the Sonic 1 title screen opened in the Tesla web browser taken prior to its release.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atniDs"&gt;Tesla’s annual holiday software update for its cars is here, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/20/tesla-releases-big-holiday-update-tiktok-app-ui-changes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It includes useful driving features like automatic access to a car’s blind spot cameras, as well as fun additions like new games built into Tesla Arcade, TikTok support, and a feature that lets the electric cars “dance to a choreographed light show.” The update’s version number is 2021.44.25, and should be rolling out over the coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYQRCp"&gt;The most useful inclusion in the update could be its blind spot camera feature which automatically shows a live camera view of the car’s blind spot whenever a driver activates a turn signal. Tesla CEO Elon Musk indicated the feature was in development &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1281121939600207873"&gt;in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s here to (hopefully) make maneuvers like changing highway lanes a little bit safer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFLVTm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sure&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1281121939600207873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n7jDOZ"&gt;Other practical improvements include an easier way to add multiple waypoints to a journey, and simplified controls for accessing a car’s primary controls. It’s also now possible to drag and drop your most frequently used apps to customize the car’s menu bar, and the heaters in the front seats can now regulate temperature based on how hot it is in the car generally.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RezT1V"&gt;Of course, this being Tesla, there are a number of less essential and more fun inclusions in the update. TikTok videos can now be watched directly from the car’s touchscreen via Tesla Theater, and Tesla Arcade has been updated with new games like the original &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834023/sega-genesis-sonic-1-tesla-arcade"&gt;announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;Sudoku&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probably best to save these for when the car is stationary, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823127/tesla-car-arcade-games-safety-nhtsa"&gt;controversially they’re also playable by passengers&lt;/a&gt; while a vehicle is in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tP4l2c"&gt;Finally there’s “Light Show,” a feature that appears to be coming to all Tesla’s after being shown off on the &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2015/12/23/the-tesla-model-x-flaps-its-wings-with-a-xmas-theme-light-show-video/"&gt;Model X in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks to u/Emulsifide for posting a complete record of the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rl21jd/tesla_20214425/"&gt;update’s changelog to Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s next flagship phone will launch on December 28</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rMEbCSv2RelPcCYZ8OXhUhVNBvA=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70300676/002p2Zyzly1gxl7k7wbp2j61o0280npd02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A teaser poster for the event.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7GZaaz"&gt;Exactly one year from the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;, Xiaomi is set to launch the successor on December 28th, the company has announced via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/2202387347/L72AgfN3a?pagetype=profilefeed"&gt;official Weibo account&lt;/a&gt;. The new lineup will be called the Xiaomi 12 series, following the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639020/xiaomi-mi-brand-ending-mix-4-confirmed"&gt;phase out its Mi branding&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. A teaser poster features Chinese sprinter Su Bingtian, which sets the expectation that the event is likely to be focused on the Chinese market before the Xiaomi flagships make their way to global markets in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzrwtN"&gt;Xiaomi’s 12 series lineup could include as many as four different devices, &lt;a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-12-12x-pro-series-launch-date-december-28-poster-ultra-specifications-features-2662501"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Gadgets 360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include the Xiaomi 12, the 12 Pro, the 12X, and the 12 Ultra, although it’s possible that not all of them will be announced during the December event (this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t announced until late March, for example). &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/12/21/xiaomi-12-12x-12-pro-names-launch-date-confirmed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Xiaomi executives have been spotted using the other three phones to post to their Weibo accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vyjIVY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="tl" dir="ltr"&gt;Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro  coming &lt;a href="https://t.co/HRCYuamab9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HRCYuamab9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1473190043711782912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YrsKej"&gt;There aren’t many official details about the upcoming handsets, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leijun/status/1465843044415336449"&gt;Xiaomi has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll be powered by Qualcomm’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor&lt;/a&gt;. Apparent marketing images of the Xiaomi 12 and 12 Pro shared by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1473190043711782912"&gt;leaker @UniverseIce on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; show the phones will feature centrally orientated hole-punch cameras. Other rumored specs of the Xiaomi 12 include a triple rear camera, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1471470228089585682"&gt;leaked renders from @OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, with a 50-megapixel primary sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4csX7"&gt;Although Xiaomi’s phones don’t have much of a presence in the US, it’s ranked as the &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/europe-smartphone-market-q3-2021/"&gt;second biggest smartphone manufacturer in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/"&gt;second biggest Android manufacturer in the world&lt;/a&gt; behind Samsung. Demand is driven by phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; which offers comparable specs to Samsung’s flagships at much more affordable prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFsnAi"&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11 launched globally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272003/xiaomi-mi-11-international-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;in February this year&lt;/a&gt;, which hopefully means that the international version of the Xiaomi 12 will arrive soon after the December event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned double-pressing Ctrl can become a powerful Windows 11 shortcut for finding your mouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/stiu8__CBQWQO_mZJ_OKFW-y5c8=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70299798/find_my_mouse_powertoys.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M2ZkAw"&gt;Ever lose your mouse cursor? It’s not hard to do when you’ve sitting in front of multiple monitors or perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;a super-ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; or maybe even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv#comments"&gt;a monstrous TV&lt;/a&gt; — but Microsoft has an amazing keyboard shortcut that can instantly surface your cursor, and I recently found it purely by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mu9kg"&gt;I was tapping away on my keyboard when all of a sudden my screens dimmed — except for one tiny disc of light. It turns out I’d accidentally double-pressed Ctrl, which triggers the Find My Mouse feature in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752275/microsofts-powertoys-windows-11-ui-video-conference-mute-find-my-mouse-features"&gt;Microsoft’s excellent optional PowerToys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mdoicl"&gt;Here’s what that looks like up close:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen dims except for one tiny disc of light, around the cursor, which I can move with my mouse." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6jQ0G0H4zIk0g0vA_3vuAsKDKfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23116573/find_my_mouse_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My Mouse in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4rzX0L"&gt;And here’s a rough idea of what it looks like with my triple-monitor rig:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWJeHibFFa9ftxwyb5OGXDpj2NE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23116574/find_my_mouse_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry about the lower quality; I should have turned off HDR video on my phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AyZ8n3"&gt;For something so simple, it’s incredibly effective — the spotlight instantly draws my attention to where my cursor is, the dimming effect makes it perfectly clear where it &lt;em&gt;isn’t. &lt;/em&gt;As someone who used to wildly wag my mouse cursor around to find it across three screens, I’m finding it coming in handy almost every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TSBrh"&gt;My only question is: why isn’t this built into Windows 11? For now, you’ll &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.51.1"&gt;have to download and install PowerToys from GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you want it. I’m a big fan; I’ve used its highly customizable FancyZones window manager to snap windows into perfectly sized positions across my screens for well over a year now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QfYnZr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTtGzZYAXgY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yedbvg"&gt;The Find My Mouse feature doesn’t require any additional setup, as I accidentally discovered myself. As long as PowerToys is up and running at startup, double-tapping Ctrl should do it. &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/mouse-utilities"&gt;Microsoft’s support page&lt;/a&gt; does show a few ways to tweak it, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is turning off the controls for OnHub routers at the end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google OnHub router" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rv2LsLBsLak7mC3uObSHRbRPkYA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70299716/onhub-2.0.0.1440961465.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google OnHub router&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8HgXPY"&gt;Google’s insistence on cloud-based controls for its networking products has occasionally caused issues, even though it was supposed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/18/9172523/google-router-announced-onhub"&gt;make life with OnHub routers simple&lt;/a&gt;. Now it will be a reason pushing anyone still using the OnHub to find a replacement by the end of next year when Google’s apps stop allowing owners to change the settings on their devices. An email went out to users, and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/11257354?hl=en"&gt;a support page&lt;/a&gt; revealed the changeover is scheduled for December 19th, 2022 (via &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/20/google-is-cutting-off-onhub-router-support-next-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14kSge"&gt;When it still seemed unusual for Google and Amazon to make their own hardware, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/26/9211513/a-look-inside-googles-new-onhub-wireless-router"&gt;teamed up with TP-Link&lt;/a&gt; and, eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/27/9621576/google-onhub-router-launched-by-asus"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt; to build OnHub routers that made a point of blending in seamlessly with the rest of your house. They had slick mobile apps to simplify setup and controls, plus a style that blended in so people were more likely to place them in a central location, which could improve WiFi coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fgZ57q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google OnHub review: Is this the router of the future?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9228739/google-onhub-router-wifi-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="F1HfBC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/11257354?hl=en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Support:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fs9iMC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before December 19, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGf0tj"&gt;Your OnHub router will continue to work as normal, but won’t receive any new software features or security updates. We recommend you upgrade to a new Wi-Fi setup today. A special discount code has been emailed to OnHub users only, for 40% off Nest Wifi on the Google Store. This promotional code is available for a limited time.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAJqZB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After December 19, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YmpaZ"&gt;Your OnHub router will still provide a Wi-Fi signal, but you’ll no longer be able to manage it with the Google Home app. &lt;br&gt;You won’t be able to update things like Wi-Fi network settings, add additional Wifi devices, or run speed tests. &lt;br&gt;Google Assistant features like “Hey Google, pause my Wi-Fi” will stop working.&lt;br&gt;OnHub performance can’t be guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LKP9P8"&gt;The idea was that by styling them to fit with interior decorations, people would be more likely to place them in a central location, thereby improving Wi-Fi coverage. They even had slick mobile apps to control them so that you didn’t have to dig through ugly menus, but now those apps are gone, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364381/google-wifi-router-management-home-app-discontinued"&gt;settings merged into Google’s Home app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Nest Wifi" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nj1irwcy7_W77pM-Gx7C62Vbp0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19276765/vpavic_191010_3722_0009.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Wifi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LJDpDT"&gt;After the shutdown date, the routers will still work, but you won’t be able to adjust their settings, get any updates, or really do any troubleshooting. For its part, Google is offering owners a 40 percent discount on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Wifi&lt;/a&gt; unit, which should knock a fair amount off of pricing that currently &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_wifi?hl=en-US"&gt;starts at $149 for a base unit by itself&lt;/a&gt; or $189 for a base and one extender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTKvYs"&gt;For routers that are several years old by now, at least, that doesn’t feel like an unfair offer to get a replacement that we called “even faster and more capable than before.” Still, it doesn’t change the feeling that buying one of these routers means “owning” it only for so long as Google is willing to provide support. How many of your supposedly smart devices will quickly turn into bricks and electronic waste if someone flips a switch on the back end?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s new Live Studio app allegedly violates OBS’ licensing policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GmejaV4x628g9yddaDL53TEeSXY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70299625/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ey0dK6"&gt;Live Studio, TikTok’s new livestreaming app for Windows, supposedly uses code from the free livestreaming program Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) (via &lt;a href="http://protocol.com/bulletins/tiktok-obs-gpl-violation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This would typically not pose an issue when done properly because OBS is open source — however, TikTok purportedly fails to adhere to OBS’ licensing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5TG2rO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Remember yesterday’s news about TikTok releasing a go live platform? Turns out it’s a fork of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OBSProject&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shoutout to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HunterAP23?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HunterAP23&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;STOP STEALING FROM OBS JESUS &lt;a href="https://t.co/kx8ckK3MXS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kx8ckK3MXS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Naaackers (@Naaackers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Naaackers/status/1471494415306788870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="goTUPL"&gt;The situation unraveled on Twitter after a user posted screenshots of what appears to be Live Studio’s code. The programmer who originally took the screenshots alleges that the app “is an illegal fork of OBS” and also claims that TikTok used OBS and then slapped its own user interface on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MA8YiG"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GlitchedMythos/status/1471520986155659265?s=20"&gt;another user&lt;/a&gt; points out, if TikTok does make use of OBS’ code, the platform is required to make the source code publicly available in accordance with the &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html"&gt;GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2&lt;/a&gt;. If TikTok fails to do so, OBS could potentially take legal action against the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAeeJY"&gt;Ben Torell, the business developer for OBS, later &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dodgepong/status/1471522226520346632"&gt;replied to that tweet&lt;/a&gt; in agreement, but noted that OBS is open to working with TikTok: “We have a commitment to dealing with GPL violations in good faith, and in the case of TikTok/ByteDance we would be happy to have a friendly working relationship with them as long as they comply with the license.” The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) got in trouble for a similar reason in October, as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752850/mastodon-trump-truth-social-network-open-source-gab-legal-notice"&gt;failed to make the source code for Truth&lt;/a&gt;, Donald Trump’s upcoming social network, publicly available after using the open-source Mastodon to build the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLG0oB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839213/tiktok-live-studio-desktop-live-streaming-twitch"&gt;TikTok quietly started testing Live Studio&lt;/a&gt; with a small group of users just a few days ago. In its current state, it appears to be a barebones streaming software with the ability to let users broadcast live, whether from a camera, phone, game, or program. TikTok didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yt9aLZ"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788051/streamlabs-quickly-drops-obs-name-called-out"&gt;OBS was involved in a controversy with Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, which also happened to unfold on Twitter. OBS admitted that it didn’t give permission for Streamlabs to use OBS in its name, but Streamlabs used it anyway. After popular streamers like Pokimane threatened to stop using and promoting Streamlabs because of the situation, Streamlabs agreed to drop “OBS” from its name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix Resurrections won’t hit HBO Max until 3AM ET on December 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DL1TKUMhpo8aX8jtePH9iY3GrBs=/471x0:1950x986/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70299184/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_12.22.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Exa6EF"&gt;Bad news, &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; fans: Warner Bros. isn’t going to be releasing &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; early on HBO Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737133/dune-hbo-max-stream-it-early-denis-villenueve"&gt;like it did for &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the highly anticipated fourth film in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;franchise will make its streaming debut on December 22nd at 3:01AM ET / 12:01AM PT — meaning you’ll either have to stay up &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; late to catch the movie when it first comes out or (more sensibly) wait until Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlL6Ni"&gt;The news isn’t entirely surprising given that HBO Max usually releases new episodes and movies at 3:01AM ET (or the equivalent time in other time zones) the date that they come out. Still, the company has broken its pattern a few times when it comes to major HBO Max releases: &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, as noted earlier, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737133/dune-hbo-max-stream-it-early-denis-villenueve"&gt;hit the service a few hours ahead&lt;/a&gt; of its October 22nd release date by streaming at 6PM ET the night before, while &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; got a slightly &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt; release time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22194171/wonder-woman-1984-soul-bridgerton-christmas-day-release-date-time-streaming"&gt;by debuting at 12PM ET&lt;/a&gt; on Christmas Day last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="huGO1i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ix7TUGVYIo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVURx9"&gt;That said, unlike Dune (which also hit theaters the night before its “official” release date), &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t appear to be offering early Tuesday night screenings in theaters either, meaning that no matter whether you’re looking to see the upcoming sequel on the big screen or streamed on your couch, you’ll have to wait until Wednesday, December 22nd rolls around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUmULP"&gt;Practically speaking, though, if you’re looking to remain spoiler-free until you have time to see &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, you might want to try and stay off Twitter on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta cracks down on phishing scams that use its trademarks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dunJab9tYwiE9zemMbCfamNPcOE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70299090/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqzIt3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-legal-action-against-phishing-attacks/"&gt;Meta is taking legal action&lt;/a&gt; against the bad actors who allegedly impersonated Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram to conduct a phishing scam. The company claims that since 2019, the defendants created over 39,000 websites in an attempt to replicate Meta’s services, subsequently deceiving users and collecting their login information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="datAvp"&gt;In the post on its blog, Meta explains that the defendants used a relay service, Ngrok, to send internet traffic to the phony login pages they created, all while concealing their identity and location. Those who clicked the phishing link were brought to a login page that resembled Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, or WhatsApp. When the user attempted to log in, defendants would collect their victims’ usernames and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WdlGJF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Meta blocks and shares phishing URLs so other platforms can also block them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="24R79K"&gt;Meta noticed that these attacks started ramping up in March of this year and worked with Ngrok to suspend the URLs that the bad actors were using. A copy of the legal complaint obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;shows that Meta’s lawsuit doesn’t just concern phishing attacks — it also raises an issue with copyright infringement. The defendants allegedly used the company’s trademarked logos and names on their fake login pages to mislead users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuzDXB"&gt;“By creating and disseminating URLs for the Phishing Websites, Defendants falsely represented themselves to be Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp, without Plaintiffs’ authorization,” the complaint reads. “Plaintiffs were adversely affected by Defendants’ phishing scheme and suffered, without limitation, damage to their brands and reputations, harm to their users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuvE0b"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20904233/instagram-anti-phishing-feature-emails-security"&gt;Instagram introduced a tool&lt;/a&gt; to help combat phishing attacks, which lets you verify that the emails you receive are actually from Instagram. Meta’s brands aren’t the only high-profile companies affected by these scams — in October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22737580/google-youtube-channel-phishing-campaign-report-malware"&gt;Google reported a large-scale phishing campaign&lt;/a&gt; that attempted to steal creators’ login cookies on YouTube, gaining access to their username and password as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVpsBf"&gt;“We proactively block and report instances of abuse to the hosting and security community, domain name registrars, privacy/proxy services, and others,” wrote Jessica Romero, Meta’s director of platform enforcement and litigation in the company’s blog post. “And Meta blocks and shares phishing URLs so other platforms can also block them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCyvk7"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21165321-facebook-phishing-lawsuit/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="facebook-phishing-lawsuit (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
