    <title>Canoo’s deal with Hyundai appears dead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNhRbIMT0jcf71XfSy4APjTwyPo=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69046133/Canoo_MPDV_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZWdxH"&gt;The deal between Canoo and Hyundai to build electric vehicles appears to be dead, as the California EV startup is moving away from trying to sell its electric vehicle technology to other automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btDNac"&gt;Canoo chairman Tony Aquila shared the news Monday during an icy investor call — Canoo’s first as a publicly-traded company. Canoo’s CEO was also absent from the call, and the company announced earlier in the day that its CFO had resigned &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000155837021003592/tmb-20210323x8k.htm"&gt;to take another job&lt;/a&gt; — the second major departure in recent weeks following Canoo losing its head of corporate strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsj7WM"&gt;“These are significant surprises on the call today, and that’s not ideal,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said at one point on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9o5Otu"&gt;The deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia"&gt;Hyundai was announced in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and it was supposed to result in both the Hyundai and Kia brands building vehicles on Canoo’s electric vehicle platform. It was seen as a major vote of confidence in the startup, which was just two years old at the time, as well as its tech. Canoo called it a “key partnership.” Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canoo did not respond beyond Aquila’s statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IRF8WN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s not ideal.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4OwgTL"&gt;Aquila took over Canoo as part of the startup’s merger with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; (SPAC) in 2020, which netted it around $600 million. Speaking obliquely at first, he said Monday that the startup’s board of directors decided to “de-emphasize” its “engineering services” line. This was the planned part of Canoo’s business that was supposed to see the startup provide technology to bigger companies that wanted to enter the electric vehicle space. Canoo’s desire to sell its technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;at one point even drew the interest of Apple, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqVes4"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390020033060/fs42020a1_hennessycapital4.htm"&gt;documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390021004077/f424b30121_canooinc.htm"&gt;before and after the merger&lt;/a&gt;, Canoo had said its planned engineering services business presented “a significant market for contract engineering services among legacy OEMs who lack the expertise to develop an electric powertrain at the pace needed to capitalize on the rising regulatory requirements and global demand for EVs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13zgnW"&gt;The startup also said these types of partnerships would serve as “concrete points of external validation for our technology and the talent of our team, as well as provide additional sources of revenue and long-term commercial opportunities.” Canoo said it was “in discussions with a number of other partners and expects to be in a position to announce many more partnerships in due course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIKRs4"&gt;But on Monday, Aquila said Canoo will now focus more on making and selling its own vehicles to commercial operators. The company has so far announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;delivery vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, and a van, all of which are built on the same underlying technological platform. Canoo will focus even less on the idea of selling its electric van to consumers through a subscription model — the original pitch when the startup broke cover in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tyMGn"&gt;Aquila has previously spoken about focusing more on selling to fleet operators and small businesses as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;opposed to customers&lt;/a&gt;, though it wasn’t until Monday that he explained just how far he is willing to take that strategy shift. To wit, Canoo &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/presentations"&gt;quietly uploaded a new investor presentation&lt;/a&gt; to its investor relations website on Monday that no longer mentions Hyundai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFkGqa"&gt;“We have so much demand for our three [vehicles], let’s get all that work done, and then let’s, you know, look at if there [are] partnerships,” he said. Aquila explained he believes that this will make for a more sound business with less risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nKFlb6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’ve got to be careful with statements you make.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFzt3k"&gt;When pressed on the startup’s previous claims about this part of its business, Aquila — who invested $35 million into Canoo before the SPAC merger — pointed to its prior leadership. Aquila said they were “a little more aggressive” than he would’ve been with some of their public statements, and that talk of potential partnerships was “presumptuous.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y21X2s"&gt;“You’ve got to be careful with statements you make. So, you know, again, I think it was a little premature,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHBnxu"&gt;While some of those executives are indeed now gone, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21277248/canoo-ev-startup-stefan-krause-leaving-evelozcity"&gt;cofounder and former CEO Stefan Krause&lt;/a&gt;, others remain — though they weren’t on Monday’s call. At one point Aquila was asked directly if Krause’s replacement, Canoo cofounder Ulrich Kranz, was still CEO. Aquila confirmed he is, though as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported late last year, Kranz’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;contract was recently renegotiated&lt;/a&gt; and he was removed from the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ho5bZ"&gt;Aquila said he believes the refocused business will help “protect” the intellectual property Canoo has developed, and that the original deal with Hyundai didn’t factor in the value of that IP. When one analyst asked if Aquila thinks Hyundai misappropriated any of Canoo’s IP, Aquila said “well I’ll leave it to you to make that decision.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ex88o0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwQnua"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXKqwr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjV3aW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s independent repair program is expanding to ‘nearly every country where Apple products are sold’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iphone 5 teardown (ifixit)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCYE7QtWwTDVz4Xn3zzDP694JJk=/29x0:772x495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69045781/El6QfQ4IFThwHHqH.1419974202.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iphone 5 teardown (ifixit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9iaWg"&gt;Getting an Apple product repaired often involves going directly to the (expensive) source — an Apple Store — or a big third-party firm. If you live somewhere with limited choices, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22357187%2Fapple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced expansion&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838307/apple-iphone-repairs-parts-independent-shops"&gt;Independent Repair Provider&lt;/a&gt; program might change that. The company plans to expand its repair program to “nearly every country where Apple products are sold,” meaning someone near you could soon be using official Apple parts to fix your cracked phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z3IiU"&gt;Right now, the program is only available in the US, Canada and Europe, but according to Apple’s announcement, repair providers from countries including Australia, Japan, and Korea will be able to join this week, with providers from even more countries including China joining the program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="352Pf4"&gt;Providers have to apply to participate, but once approved, they can only buy a limited variety of first-party materials like batteries, screens, and diagnostic tools. So while your local repair person will be able to fix the most common issues with official parts, anything more more exotic will have to go through Apple, one of its authorized service providers, or risk voiding a warranty or becoming unsupported down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HL8BsO"&gt;If you actually do the hard work of repairing devices, there’s other things to be aware of, too. Joining the program comes with a contract that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;reportedly gives Apple&lt;/a&gt; the right to both inspect repair shops and fine them if it finds something amiss. Apple can charge $1,000 per transaction for any shop it catches using knockoff parts in more than two percent of repairs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdgFqM"&gt;Apple generally only seems to be supportive of third-party repairs if it can find a way to make money off of them, and this repair program doesn’t seem to be any different. This is the company that routinely attempts to kill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;right-to-repair bills&lt;/a&gt; and has devised methods to make iPhones non-functional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;if they use third-party batteries&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkBzsR"&gt;You can read the full list of participating countries and regions &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22357187%2Fapple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike sues over Lil Nas X’s ‘unauthorized Satan Shoes’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSCHF / Lil Nas X “Satan Shoes”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8EvA7QVn3v6cHVYppjVQ96n9S8=/64x0:1984x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69045731/Exbfpl2WgAAQkl8_resized.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;MSCHF&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Xfw8C"&gt;Nike has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880.1.0.pdf"&gt;sued internet collective MSCHF&lt;/a&gt; for selling “unauthorized Satan Shoes” in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X. The shoe company says MSCHF infringed on its trademarks by selling limited-edition custom Nikes that were allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/style/nike-satan-shoes-lil-Nas-x.html"&gt;modified with a drop of human blood&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Satan Shoes (as they are officially called) were announced last week, Nike claims they’ve harmed its reputation, “including among consumers who believe that Nike is endorsing satanism.” It’s asking for the shoes to be destroyed and for MSCHF to pay financial damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frLAgR"&gt;MSCHF is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320127/mschf-products-jesus-shoes-puff-chicken-office-business"&gt;known for stunt products&lt;/a&gt; like its 2019 “Jesus Shoes,” a $1,425 pair of white Nike Air Max 97s with custom stitching and 60ccs of water from the River Jordan. Nike didn’t object to the Jesus Shoes. But it’s apparently less happy with their theological inverse: a 666-pair drop of $1,018 red and black Air Max 97s, containing 60ccs of ink and one drop of human blood, embellished with a pentagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="A0d9Pf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nike says a devil shoe made with literal blood is bad for its brand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tigwl"&gt;Nike’s suit makes a few general arguments against modifying shoes, including that “making changes to the midsole may pose safety risks for consumers.” (These shoes stand accused of putting people’s souls &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;their soles at risk.) But it mostly argues that a satanic shoe containing literal blood is bad for Nike’s brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ddmcp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MSCHF x Lil Nas X "Satan Shoes"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nike Air Max '97&lt;br&gt; Contains 60cc ink and 1 drop of human blood&lt;br&gt; ️666 Pairs, individually numbered&lt;br&gt; $1,018&lt;br&gt; ️March 29th, 2021 &lt;a href="https://t.co/XUMA9TKGSX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XUMA9TKGSX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SAINT (@saint) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saint/status/1375532655551389696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DC6wHP"&gt;To make its case, Nike cites social media comments from people who don’t realize MSCHF was just unofficially reselling the shoes. “Won’t buy Nike again. You are banned!” says one. “This is sickening!!! How is Nike not involved when there’s a Nike symbol on the shoe!!!” says another. “MSCHF is deceiving consumers into believing that Nike manufactures or approves of the Satan Shoes,” Nike’s complaint claims. “Consumers’ belief that the Satan Shoes are genuine Nike products is causing consumers to never want to purchase any Nike products in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAwVAN"&gt;As University of New Hampshire law professor Alexandra Roberts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lexlanham/status/1376648694850801669"&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, MSCHF can defend itself on multiple grounds. It can cite the First Sale Doctrine, which protects reselling goods that are protected by intellectual property laws — like people selling designer clothes on Poshmark, for instance. It can also claim the shoes are protected as a parody or argue that buyers are unlikely to confuse these modified Satan Shoes with off-the-shelf Nikes, random internet commenters notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Whd6cD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How is Nike not involved when there’s a Nike symbol on the shoe!!!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a4qCbK"&gt;Very, very few people will ever own a $1,000 blood-and-pentagram sneaker. If the case goes to trial, though, there’s more than a limited-edition satanic shoe line at stake. “The case has potentially broad implications because we’re seeing a rise in this kind of customization of branded goods as well as upcycling,” Roberts told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; via email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nike’s legal exhibit distinguishing standard Nike shoe from “unauthorized Satan Shoe”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCD9l551DV_WlLU8LxbUNSjFM0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406803/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_7.20.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nike&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrm5Bb"&gt;It’s fine to directly resell products, Roberts says, and it’s legal to advertise goods while mentioning somebody else’s trademark. You can also do things like &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-08-14-0108140233-story.html"&gt;dismember Barbie dolls and sell pictures of them as art&lt;/a&gt;. “But what about the businesses making jewelry out of authentic Chanel buttons, or cutting fringes into genuine Vuitton bags?” Earlier this year, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/chanel-is-suing-shriver-duke-over-jewelry-made-from-authentic-logo-bearing-buttons/"&gt;Chanel sued a company&lt;/a&gt; for “misappropriating” its brand for recycled button earrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGpxXS"&gt;Basically, MSCHF bought shoes that it could legally resell using Nike’s branding, but it heavily modified them into what’s arguably a new product whose quality Nike can’t control, then sold them as a commercial good rather than a traditional art piece. Depending on how a court weighs all those factors, it could create a precedent for future cases. “I think other high fashion brands will be keeping a close eye on this case,” Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RUcMVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think other high fashion brands will be keeping a close eye on this case.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6lzdWA"&gt;The Satan Shoes dropped alongside a provocative Lil Nas X music video that’s &lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a35966473/lil-nas-x-apology-montero-satan-blood-sneakers-controversy-explained/"&gt;drawn the ire&lt;/a&gt; of conservative commentators. So it makes sense that Nike might distance itself. But &lt;a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/mschfs-nike-branded-sneakers-injected-with-human-blood-raise-some-interesting-legal-issues/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The Fashion Law&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, MSCHF has anticipated and even invited lawsuits in the past, saying a suit would “help increase the value of the product.” By taking it to court, Nike is almost certainly boosting the profile of MSCHF’s latest drop, as well as potentially causing new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUikCR"&gt;“I’m not shocked Nike chose to sue, but I think they might also want to proceed with caution to avoid being perceived as squelching speech or siding with the Christian right over a popular Black artist,” says Roberts. “I expect Nike might be hoping for a quick, low-key settlement in which MSCHF agrees not to ship out the shoes.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Unauthorized Satan Shoe” exhibit, Nike lawsuit" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxFn3SvEcQsMamwJQI1u53WelbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406838/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_7.46.16_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OWgf9m"&gt;MSCHF didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Lil Nas X, who posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESf8Un3g9zM"&gt;a prank “apology” video&lt;/a&gt; for the shoes yesterday, is not named as a defendant in the suit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZ77ur"&gt;The Louvre Museum &lt;a href="https://presse.louvre.fr/the-musee-du-louvre-launches-online-collection-database-and-new-website/"&gt;announced Friday&lt;/a&gt; that its entire collections are now available to view online at &lt;a href="http://collections.louvre.fr"&gt;collections.louvre.fr&lt;/a&gt;. This includes pieces that are on loan or in storage, which is exciting for museum nerds like me who have ever expressed woe at the number of cool things museums have kept away from my eager eyeballs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuhVN5"&gt;“The site offers several ways to delve into the collections: simple or advanced searches, entries by curatorial department, and themed albums,” says the press release. I humbly offer another way to delve in: hand-selected links to some paintings of animals that should tickle your whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7pp8Z"&gt;The Louvre’s terms of use for their photos indicate that I can’t repost them from their site, and I would strongly prefer not to start a fresh fight with the French. Instead, I will describe a sampling of paintings for you and let you make the decision as to whether you’ll click through and marvel at them yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Udc9TB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010066422"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monkey painter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps: A monkey, dressed in 17th century garb and holding a paint palette and brushes, focuses solemnly on its canvas as it delicately applies a brushstroke. The colors are somber in tone and, for reasons unbeknownst to me, there is a gun hanging on the wall. If you look through a doorway to the left you can see another monkey, perhaps his assistant, toiling away at a low bench. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UdN36x"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010065256"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter as a satyr with Antiope and their twins Amphion and Zethus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Vincent Sellaer: A very pale nude woman sits among a bunch of weird looking toddlers, while an extremely creepy satyr (typical Jupiter) lurks in the background. There’s a cat in the lower left corner, tucked under the elbow of one of the toddlers. The cat is not exactly the subject of this piece, but there is a detail shot of its face for you to click on — clearly the Louvre knows what we’re here for. According to the description, translated from French, the cat “may be a sign of sensuality or even lust.” Sure, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uLiX78"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010064917"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saint Jerome in meditation, with his lion, skull, books, vase of flowers and hourglass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Georg Pencz: Again, the feline is not the subject here, but it is the star of the show nonetheless. A long-bearded St. Jerome sits among his morbid accoutrements, while a lion sits in shadow behind him with one paw placed on his hip. There’s a twinkle in the lion’s eye, perhaps a smirk on its lip. What is this lion thinking? Why are its claws so prominent? What schemes are being plotted behind its gently furrowed brow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PUXJYW"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010057845"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dog and game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Christophe Huet: If there’s any painting I deeply wish I could zoom, screenshot, and share, it’s this one. A dog sits guarding a collection of freshly hunted game, including a hare, a duck, and some pheasants. It snarls at another dog, which appears to be mid-stride, with a dopey expression that can only be read as &lt;em&gt;Who, me? &lt;/em&gt;I love you funky dog, and I hope you were able to get some good snacks eventually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="sWuom4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A modder made a way to mine bitcoin on a Game Boy (very, very slowly)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwnOitTZZIJ-UZZcoTNtyFXcSNE=/206x0:2309x1402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69045134/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_1.23.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: StackSmashing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WYXJzP"&gt;If your desire to mine bitcoin has been thwarted by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;lack of GPU stock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333544/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-rate-limit-unlock-driver"&gt;flimsy BIOS locks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ckjr9x214c"&gt;YouTuber StackSmashing&lt;/a&gt; may be able to help. They’ve made a Game Boy miner, which only needs a Game Boy console (and a slightly modified Link Cable), a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/21/22242619/raspberry-pi-pico-microcontroller-tiny-computer-diy-projects"&gt;Raspberry Pi Pico&lt;/a&gt;, and a regular computer (&lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/mine-bitcoin-game-boy-raspberry-pi"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97qdGg"&gt;The conceit of the project is that all of the mining happens on a stock Game Boy, which was released a full 20 years before bitcoin was invented. Of course, it does need some help: the Game Boy can’t actually connect to the internet, and it can’t hold the entire blockchain. To deal with that, StackSmashing uses the Pico and Link Cable to connect to the computer, which is running a bitcoin node. After it’s connected, the Game Boy runs the hashing program from a programmable cartridge, and even plays a fun animation while it’s mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jwg6jp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ckjr9x214c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n3IiXi"&gt;Given that the Game Boy is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; slower than today’s dedicated mining machines (it apparently runs at 0.8 hashes per second, while some of the fastest ASIC miners run &lt;em&gt;125 trillion times&lt;/em&gt; faster, &lt;a href="https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/microbt/whatsminer-m30s-1"&gt;at 100 terahashes per second&lt;/a&gt;), it’s astronomically unlikely that StackSmashing would be able to actually mine any bitcoins. However, when they set up a new bitcoin blockchain with no records on it, they were able to confirm that yes, the Game Boy was able to successfully mine blocks. Who’s ready for GameCoin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c6d8Kr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;„it’s without a doubt the slowest miner I’ve ever heard of”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But you have heard of it!” &lt;a href="https://t.co/wJENJ1xLW7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wJENJ1xLW7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— stacksmashing (@ghidraninja) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ghidraninja/status/1376269148918013953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Asus is riding a new wave of compact RTX 3060 cards with this bulky GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus Phoenix GeForce RTX 3060 Graphics Card" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YGSCHMhyjjmLOT9CNdzskbIw5I=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044824/ASUS_GeForce_RTX_3060_12GB_PHOENIX1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8xDfmT"&gt;Unlike most GPUs in the RTX 3000 series, Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics cards can be relatively compact. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;dual-fan EVGA RTX 3060 XC&lt;/a&gt; we reviewed measured just &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/products/specs/gpu.aspx?pn=716f8f06-ce42-42da-96f5-28429a21ec06"&gt;201.8mm long&lt;/a&gt;, for example, making it easy to fit in most gaming cases. But if you want something even smaller, Asus has become the latest to announce &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FMotherboards-Components%2FGraphics-Cards%2FPhoenix%2FPH-RTX3060-12G%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356900%2Fasus-rtx-3060-phoenix-single-fan-compact-gpu-announced" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a single-fan RTX 3060 GPU&lt;/a&gt; from its Phoenix brand, which is known for making compact desktop GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2xGYx"&gt;Asus’ single-fan GPU is actually the longest single-fan GPU announced so far, at 177mm long (and 2.55-slots wide), while companies like &lt;a href="https://www.gainward.com/main/vgapro.php?id=1108&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;Gainward&lt;/a&gt; (170mm), &lt;a href="https://www.palit.com/palit/vgapro.php?id=4107&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;pn=NE63060019K9-190AF&amp;amp;tab=ov"&gt;Palit&lt;/a&gt; (170mm), and &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/Graphics-Card/GeForce-RTX-3060-AERO-ITX-12G/Specification"&gt;MSI&lt;/a&gt; (172mm) have all created more compact single-fan RTX 3060 GPUs that are even slightly shorter and take up only two slots each. Still, the Asus is notably shorter than the already-short dual-fan EVGA 3060 card we reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B13jDq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10418741"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hsmToU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Asus has yet to announce a price or release date for the RTX 3060 Phoenix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lf5yS7"&gt;Like other RTX 3060 cards, the RTX 3060 Phoenix includes the same 3,584 CUDA cores, 12GB of GDDR6 memory, and four display outputs: one HDMI 2.1 and three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs. The card requires a single 8-pin PCIe power connection, a minimum power supply of 650W, and has no RGB lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57w9oz"&gt;Asus has yet to announce a price or release date for the RTX 3060 Phoenix. But you can anticipate that when the cards become available, they will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;likely be difficult to find and buy&lt;/a&gt; — and the street prices these cards go for are more than the actual MSRP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rYmnLH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: $329 with an asterisk sign","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Don’t park your Hyundai Kona EV inside because it could catch fire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M6ELYp9TPANw_zt7Oo8N4PbBD98=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044670/akrales_180329_2351_1027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w4Sstv"&gt;The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a recall for 2019–2020 Hyundai Kona and 2020 Hyundai Ioniq electric vehicles after over a dozen battery fires were reported. The agency is also warning owners against parking their vehicles near their homes or any flammable structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6KVWj"&gt;An electrical short in the Kona’s lithium-ion battery cells increases the risk of fire while parked, charging, and driving, NHTSA said, adding, “The safest place to park them is outside and away from homes and other structures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VG49vN"&gt;Last month, Hyundai announced that it would recall some 76,000 Kona EVs built between 2018 and 2020 over battery fire concerns. It was the second recall for the Kona but the first one that was global in nature. The automaker also said it would recall some Ioniqs and electric buses that it manufactures. In total, Hyundai said it would recall 82,000 vehicles, which it estimates will cost $900 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uKennn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hyundai said it would recall 82,000 vehicles, which it estimates will cost $900 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8jG1f3"&gt;The Kona’s battery is manufactured by LG Energy Solutions, which, like Hyundai, is also based in South Korea. LG Chem is a major supplier of lithium-ion batteries to automakers like General Motors, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and their respective parent companies Volkswagen Group and Daimler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TioBLX"&gt;Hyundai is the latest automaker to issue a voluntary recall due to battery defects. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;GM said it would recall nearly 69,000 Chevy Bolts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18659983/audi-etron-recall-battery-fire-risk"&gt;Audi recalled over 500 E-Tron SUVs&lt;/a&gt;, both over risks for battery fires. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china"&gt;China’s Nio recalled nearly 5,000&lt;/a&gt; of its ES8 electric SUVs after multiple reports of battery fires surfaced in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lFK7"&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars, but the topic has received increased scrutiny as more EVs hit the road. First responders are even being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;trained to handle EV battery fires&lt;/a&gt; since they can’t be extinguished via some traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnJnuo"&gt;Tesla’s vehicle fires have especially caught a lot of attention — to the point that CEO Elon Musk has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1120802953130995714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;publicly pushed back on the coverage of those incidents&lt;/a&gt;. Other automakers, like Jaguar, have experienced &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-05-02/deformed-chassis-put-nio-ev-on-fire-101410947.html"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; fires with &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/a-jaguar-i-pace-ev-had-a-thermal-incident-while-parke-1830995550"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4pJ0M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision shrinks Call of Duty file sizes so you can download other games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFnPATJ59ltI0m8yasumTHHe1qQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044601/AGB_WZ_BR_Overview.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WLlKY5"&gt;Activision is finally doing something about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302057/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-modern-warfare-500gb-size"&gt;the tremendous file sizes&lt;/a&gt; of recent &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/03/Season-Two-Reloaded-Warzone-File-Size-Reduction#MWandWarzoneFileSize"&gt;The company is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that both &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;and the free-to-play &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;will be much easier on hard drives after the next update. The space savings vary depending on what platform the game is installed (and which content packs you have installed), but they’ll be at least 30GB if you have both full games installed — meaning you’ll actually have enough room to install another AAA game if you like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzq2Hn"&gt;The update is set to be released on March 30th, but while it may be easier on your hard drive, downloading it won’t be easy on your internet connection. Activision says the one-time Season Two Reloaded update will be larger than usual (up to 57GB for those who just play &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;). The good news is that future updates shouldn’t be as big, but you will want to mind your data caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0OE8I"&gt;According to the blog post, the space savings come from file optimizations and “streamlining content packs.” It’s also worth noting that individual content packs can be removed, getting rid of game modes you don’t play. For example, you can uninstall single player and Special Ops if you only fire up &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; to play with friends. The blog post mentions that some users will have to reinstall content packs to get the optimized versions, but Activision wasn’t immediately available to comment on the circumstances that would cause that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvQGb9"&gt;The specific space savings for each platform are listed below, but to add some context, let’s imagine you’ve got &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt; installed on your PlayStation 4. After the update, you’ll have freed up enough space to install &lt;em&gt;The Witness&lt;/em&gt; (4.2GB) and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; (26.3GB) — which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350340/ps4-ps5-games-sony-astro-bot-rescue-mission-play-at-home-psvr"&gt;now both free on the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is betting big on Google’s Android services: RCS, YouTube TV, Pixel, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkBer63LTPctRN6fpc5LooDif9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044383/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DTBIdh"&gt;Google and T-Mobile are announcing a huge partnership today, with the carrier agreeing to showcase a suite of Google’s services on Android phones sold on the carrier’s network. The list includes officially supporting Google’s Android Messages (with RCS) app on all of T-Mobile’s Android phones, dropping T-Mobile’s own TV services for Google’s YouTube TV, showcasing Google One as the default backup service, and expanding support and sales of Google hardware like the Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwYqkZ"&gt;T-Mobile and Google say the carrier has “the most Android smartphone customers in the US.” With this big partnership, those customers will have a phone that is more likely to showcase native Google services instead of less-well-supported services from the carrier or manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFNKtp"&gt;It’s also a big win for Google, which will finally see another US carrier besides Verizon take a real shot at promoting the Pixel line of phones. Pixel sales in the US have not reached any sort of real critical mass, though they’ve done better since Google started selling less-expensive versions like the 3A and 4A. Early on, Verizon was the premier partner, but it never materialized into big numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46l3wu"&gt;But the biggest news is probably that T-Mobile is winding down its Live, Live Plus, and Live Zone services in favor of YouTube TV. T-Mobile customers get $10 off that service, and there will be various other offers, including three months free of YouTube Premium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22121019"&gt;More on that deal (and the surprising decision to wind down T-Mobile’s own TV streaming service) here from Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="etJqKX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;RCS takes another baby step toward becoming the default&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b7FAE0"&gt;For messaging, it’s yet another step forward in the long, convoluted, and harrowing journey to normalize the next-gen RCS standard across the US. Just this past January, some strange backroom dealings meant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 devices shipped with Samsung Messages as the default&lt;/a&gt; in the US, while most of the rest of the world got Android Messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYt9du"&gt;Samsung phones on T-Mobile &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use Android Messages as the default in the future, as will every other Android phone T-Mobile sells. Google says the switchover will happen by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ruRF4y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is rolling out end-to-end encryption for RCS in Android Messages beta ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"},{"title":"Google is finally taking charge of the RCS rollout&amp;amp;nbsp;","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681573/google-rcs-chat-android-texting-carriers-imessage-encryption"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zz0VYP"&gt;Google is also providing a small update on its ongoing effort to support secure end-to-end encryption for RCS on Android Messages. It reiterated that the rollout for beta testers already started and that it “will continue throughout 2021.” Fully encrypted chat for 1:1 messages for RCS is currently only supported inside Android Messages, so T-Mobile’s decision to make it the standard will mean that more people will have it made available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBU8ge"&gt;Google and T-Mobile are also announcing plans to “build a messaging business together.” That’s a reference to RCS’s ability to be used for business chat — just as you can with iMessage or WhatsApp for some businesses. It’s one of the things that originally seemed like it might be a big driver for adoption since there’s money to be made on the backend as businesses pay for the service, but it hasn’t reached its potential yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Etp1bY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon didn’t do much for Google’s Pixel phones, but maybe T-Mobile will&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOemtC"&gt;Last and perhaps least, T-Mobile is adopting Google One’s cloud storage as the default backup service for Android phones. Unlike with TV, it doesn’t appear there will be any discounts on offer. Custom online storage solutions from carriers are a notoriously annoying piece of crapware installed on Android phones — just ask any Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customer who bought their phone from their carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raB1nC"&gt;When asked for comment, Google says it isn’t “disclosing the financial terms of this deal.” Google and T-Mobile already have a pre-existing relationship, as T-Mobile is the network that supports Google’s MVNO, Google Fi. This new deal doesn’t change anything for Fi customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSRKmA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is already shutting down its live TV service, partners with YouTube TV and Philo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkjNGeYXyH83iWeu69Bj9WlB2G4=/179x0:2249x1380/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044385/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_3.19.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzT0Ue"&gt;Only five months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535264/tmobile-tvision-live-internet-tv-streaming-service-price"&gt;announcing its TVision streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile today shared news that TVision’s three bundles of live channels will all shut down at the end of April. The development comes as part of T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22120959"&gt;new partnership with Google and YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s making out to be a huge deal. The carrier says YouTube TV will now fill the role of its “live TV solution.” It’s also positioning Philo TV as the replacement for its base offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6Up7y"&gt;The Live, Live Plus, and Live Zone services that were available with TVision will go dark on April 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWpsbg"&gt;T-Mobile is giving a free month of YouTube TV to customers who had signed up for one of the TVision Live packages, and all T-Mobile subscribers will be eligible to save $10 on the usual monthly rate of $64.99; so if they want the service, it’ll cost $54.99 per month. They can also get three free months of YouTube Premium. On Philo’s side, customers can also get $10 off the usual price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VIIhE"&gt;“YouTube TV is a leader in this space,” T-Mobile said in today’s press release. “It offers the same great flexibility, robust content and convenience that TVision customers love.” The message is clear: T-Mobile is teaming up with a company that has been in this game longer and is already familiar with everything it takes to make streaming, watch-anywhere TV work — even if it feels like the costs keep climbing higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkan9Q"&gt;In what comes off as an attempt to sugarcoat a short-lived misstep, T-Mobile says its “TVision initiative was launched to give customers new choices and help millions cut the cord, while expanding appeal for the company’s forthcoming wireless home Internet service.” That doesn’t quite match the usual brazen “Uncarrier” tone that &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201027005931/en/"&gt;T-Mobile had back in October&lt;/a&gt;, when CEO Mike Sievert said “just like we changed wireless for good, now we’re gonna change TV for good.” At the time, T-Mobile said TVision Live was “a total game-changer for anyone who wants live news and sports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYIAnX"&gt;Sievert has now changed his tune. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fturns-out-tv-is-better-with-friends&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;, he acknowledged that TV is better “with friends,” and went into more detail on what led to T-Mobile’s revamped approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4znjJL"&gt;This shift may surprise some given last year’s TVision streaming services launch. But innovation seldom follows a straight line. Since launching the TVision initiative, we’ve learned a lot about the TV industry, about streaming products, and of course, about TV customers. We also saw trends that made us take a fresh look at how to best do in video what we always do: put customers first. With our TV software provider encountering some financial challenges and with our broader, strategic partnerships with Google and Philo, we saw an opportunity to deliver unique value to our customers and strengthen the TVision initiative with the best partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VKXEW"&gt;This industry is incredibly fragmented, with new streaming services launching all the time, and we’ve concluded that we can add even more value to consumers’ TV choices by partnering with the best services out there, negotiating incredible streaming media deals for T-Mobile customers, and helping our customers navigate the increasingly complex streaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O8PqJk"&gt;Sievert describes the new arrangement as “a big upgrade,” adding that “YouTube TV offers more than twice as many channels as TVision Live, and Philo offers nearly twice as many channels as TVision Vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCCJ3h"&gt;TVision Live had started at $40 / month, with Live Plus and Live Zone each increasing by another $10. As other internet TV providers know, it’s unlikely that T-Mobile would’ve been able to hang on to those lower tiers for long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeLpTJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fvibe&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Vibe&lt;/a&gt; — a $10-per-month service that provides on-demand access (but not live streams) to shows from AMC, Discovery, MTV, and other networks — is also being phased out. Same goes for TVision Channels, which lets customers aggregate their subscriptions from Showtime, Stars, and Epix. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub 4K streaming dongle&lt;/a&gt; will remain available, and it sounds like YouTube TV will now get a prominent spot on that device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51iACF"&gt;You can look at this as a retreat on T-Mobile’s part, but I think its decision is probably the right one. YouTube TV remains the streaming TV service to beat, and there just wasn’t enough about TVision to make it stand out among YTTV and other competitors. Any price advantage was never going to last. Above all else, T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297311/tmobile-5g-mid-band-magenta-max-unlimited-data"&gt;still touting its strong 5G network advantage&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max data plan&lt;/a&gt; it announced in late February. The plan is the only one among major carriers to lift any deprioritization limits on data usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAubD5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 29th, 4:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article has been updated with more details on T-Mobile’s revamped TV approach, with new details on Philo’s role in the initiative and a blog post from T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
