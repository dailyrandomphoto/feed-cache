    <title>Gambling apps are coming to Google’s Play Store in the US and 14 other countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rn0PUSNmb09mwPKzRPcfVs08gGQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736980/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XwP73j"&gt;An upcoming change to Google’s Play Store policies will allow gambling and betting Android apps that use real money in 15 more countries, including the US, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/google-play-android-gambling-apps/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, gambling apps are only allowed in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032"&gt;four countries&lt;/a&gt;: Brazil, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gA1zel"&gt;The new rules will be applied starting on March 1st, and they’ll permit gambling apps in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Of course, each country will have its own limitations on what kind of online gambling is legal, with some countries allowing online casinos, sports betting, lotteries, and daily fantasy sports, and some being more restrictive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eZ25z"&gt;The restrictions are also complicated. Most countries only allow lotteries if they’re run by the government, but some, like the UK, don’t have that restriction. And as is often the case, what’s allowed in the US varies on a state-by-state basis. Anyone looking to release a gambling app will have to do their legal homework first, considering the patchwork of laws and regulations permitting specific types of online gambling in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="List of the allowed types of gambling products in the US, with the list of states each is allowed in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8mFm19HsReh1R3ZDC8wjrpyOLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266468/Screen_Shot_2021_01_28_at_12.37.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US has the largest details box by far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zvcAoD"&gt;The change won’t be opening the floodgates for just anyone to release a slot machine app. Currently, Google requires developers to go &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/gambling"&gt;through an application process&lt;/a&gt; to get their gambling apps on the Play Store, and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10318510#zippy=%2Cunited-states"&gt;the new policies&lt;/a&gt; won’t be removing that requirement. The application ensures that the developer uploading the app is licensed to run a gambling operation in the country where the app will be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBACt7"&gt;Before this change, users who wanted to use gambling apps on their Android phones would have to sideload them, a practice that Google &lt;a href="https://phandroid.com/2019/12/06/google-could-soon-prevent-android-users-from-sideloading-apps/"&gt;has been discouraging more and more&lt;/a&gt; as time goes on. iPhone users, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;have been allowed to download them&lt;/a&gt; straight from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijC51N"&gt;Of course, it could be argued that many games and apps that are on the Play Store today already include gambling mechanics (any game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;that includes loot boxes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or apps that allow people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;to make bets on Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;). The apps that will be allowed under this policy differ in that they’ll be allowing apps that are purely made for gambling, using real money. If I could make one request to Google, it’d be to let people hide gambling apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168280/google-ad-policy-gambling-alcohol-ban-limit-monetization"&gt;they’re allowed to hide gambling ads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brU20h"&gt;Google was not immediately available to comment on the policy change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stadia’s biggest (timed) exclusive won’t be exclusive anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0EERlykDxdZsw1grlCLc4vmPXF0=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736974/VaultHeist_04.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIHdzG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21294817/google-stadia-crayta-launch-july-1st-state-share-pricing-features-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; timed Stadia exclusivity is coming to an end soon, with developer Unit 2 Games confirming that the title will be making its way to PC “very soon.” Originally announced as a “First on Stadia” timed exclusive,&lt;em&gt; Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s jump to other platforms was always more a question of “when” rather than “if,” but the announcement marks the first official indication of the regular PC port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xd6mZB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Stadia lets you share a URL to your very own game worlds with Crayta, coming July 1st ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21294817/google-stadia-crayta-launch-july-1st-state-share-pricing-features-exclusive"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Dosy2U"&gt;The news — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Yogarine/status/1354490575362383872/photo/1"&gt;originally spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, citing a tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Yogarine/status/1354490575362383872/photo/1"&gt;Twitter user @Yogarine&lt;/a&gt; — comes from an announcement by Unit 2 Games in the game’s Discord chat. The company promises that it’ll have more information (including a launch date and the digital storefront where &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt; will be offered) in the coming weeks, but it does promise that it’s “still every bit as committed to Stadia as we’ve always been.” The new PC version will also offer full crossplay with the Stadia version of &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKV9g2"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-style game creation game that’s built on Unreal Engine, &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;standout feature (aside from the rare status of a Stadia-exclusive title) was as one of the first games to adopt Stadia’s State Share technology, which (in theory) promised that any Stadia player could join a &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt; world simply by clicking on a link. It’s a feature that’ll likely stay exclusive to the Stadia version of the game even after the PC port launches, given its reliance on Google’s streaming tech to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games Store users claimed 749 million free games last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7SqDn6Cig3DDXNHsJGw7FqiYTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736814/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qepgyE"&gt;Epic Games Store released a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;bevy of stats&lt;/a&gt; to show off how its game storefront grew in 2020 compared to 2019, its launch year. It announced that there are over 160 million accounts now on PC, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam"&gt;108 million users registered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It almost doubled in monthly active users from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million last month. Epic also saw its daily active user count go up to 31.3 million, which the company claims is a 192 percent boost. Its peak concurrent player count hit 13 million in 2020, almost doubling its 7 million peak in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVJUlj"&gt;Unsurprising to no one, giving away free games each week is a nice way to keep people coming back to your storefront. (It also helps when your store is the sole provider of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on PC.) There were 103 free games last year, and gamers claimed over 749 million copies. And good news: Epic has committed to continuing this popular tradition of giving away titles in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hwkvyw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic trails far behind Steam, but it’s growing at a steady pace&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="43bxxW"&gt;All of this to say that the Epic Games Store is growing. Gamers spent $700 million within the PC game store in 2020, with $265 million of that being the actual amount spent by gamers on third-party games not made by Epic (excluding the value of coupons and promos used on those games, as well as the value of Epic’s own funding of these developers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5JC4X"&gt;Looking forward, Epic says it’s working to make it easier for developers to publish games on the Epic Games Store. For everyone else, it says it’s working on community-oriented features, including an overhaul to its social components, player profiles, and updates to its achievements and wishlist features. Perhaps, it’ll expand on its efforts to host &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22183446/epic-games-store-spotify-app-store-ambitions"&gt;more than just games&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZ2xJ"&gt;Barring some totally unpredictable shift in tide in the next 10 years, Steam will always have bigger numbers than the Epic Games Store. But its solid performance in 2020 proves that there’s room in the industry for another competitor to keep growing. And it seems to validate that the ways Epic’s strategy differs from Valve’s (making deals for timed-exclusive games, paying developers more per game purchase) are still resonating with developers and publishers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood will allow ‘limited buys’ of stocks like GameStop starting Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gallery Photo:" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWWxHZ18GLihVQwhbNxTiZmANmw=/0x1:1100x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736655/twtr-nyse-26_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p7rRY3"&gt;Robinhood has announced that, beginning on Friday, January 29th, it will allow “limited buys” on restricted stocks, potentially signaling the end of a brutal day-long hold on GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Nokia, and other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgzS4T"&gt;“Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities,” the company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed.” The company’s statement does not elaborate on how limited purchases will be for GameStop and the other restricted stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eZSElg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To be clear, this was a risk-management decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V1nB2W"&gt;On Thursday morning, Robinhood restricted purchases of GameStop and the other stocks, which had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;driven to unusually high prices&lt;/a&gt; by coordinated activity on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. The decision to restrict purchases provoked a significant backlash, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;several congressional committees&lt;/a&gt; have already pledged to investigate Robinhood in the wake of the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLmbag"&gt;The decision to limit purchases of the stocks went far beyond Robinhood, with E-Trade, Interactive Brokers, Apex Holdings, and other providers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;refusing to book orders&lt;/a&gt; for the stocks. Still, Robinhood has been the focus of much of the backlash, including &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/"&gt;at least one proposed class action case against the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw6epI"&gt;In its statement, Robinhood emphasized that the decision to halt purchases was made because of internal risk to the company, not as a response to outside pressure from other financial actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8F7Kl"&gt;“As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment,” the post argues. “To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read why r/WallStreetBets was founded and how its creator left</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7N2xrxCK7KU7pndf5wrAq3iU8Dg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736552/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yttJta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=mhp"&gt;has written an excellent profile&lt;/a&gt; of the man who started r/WallStreetBets, the subreddit that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;embroiled in controversy this week&lt;/a&gt;. His name is Jaime Rogozinski, and if you’re wondering how he’s been feeling about this whole thing, he likens it to “watching one of those horror films where you can see the bad guy slowly going up the stairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsX0vX"&gt;The article gives the impression that the subreddit, which is now trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;raise the price of GameStop stocks to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, wasn’t only created for profit — it was created for fun. Rogozinski was apparently bored with the usual stock market advice about just buying index funds and was looking for actual discussions about individual stocks. He also talks about how the community is “refreshing,” with posts ranging from “‘Look at my money!” to “Look at all this money I lost.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1BKq53"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s no longer what it used to be.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHhurd"&gt;As many classic stories go, though, the creation ends up turning on the creator. Rogozinski is no longer a moderator for the subreddit; he was booted off last April after clashing with moderators that he said “were straight up white supremacists.” This is a problem, it seems, that the community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;has been dealing with for a while&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W763Sm"&gt;It’s an excellent story, and it gives great insight into what happens when a community becomes something its creator never intended and the fallout that can have on the creator’s life. If you’ve been following the story of WallStreetBets, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=mhp"&gt;definitely worth a read.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-Trade won’t let you buy GameStop and AMC stock either, reports now say</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y20Wg8"&gt;Financial services company E-Trade has restricted purchases of GameStop and AMC stock, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/e-trade-restricts-purchases-of-gamestop-amc-shares?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;amp;cmpId=google"&gt;a source tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The two stocks have become popular on forums like the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and seen their prices skyrocket to unprecedented highs over the past week. (GameStop hit $483 earlier on Thursday and briefly went above that during the day. Last Thursday, the stock closed at $43.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVjHDf"&gt;We’ve seen users on Twitter report that they have been unable to buy the stocks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images suggest Sony’s camera-focused Xperia 1 III might have a much better zoom lens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQWZwLl3UMsHlMWxsit__CC7QEk=/342x0:4040x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736338/1iiiresized.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alleged leaked renders of the upcoming flagship show Sony sticking with a minimalist design and tall form factor. | Image: OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AzD07h"&gt;An early look at Sony’s next flagship phone shows it might be getting a more powerful zoom lens, thanks to some &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-sonys-new-flagship-the-xperia-1-iii-1611846138-426237886"&gt;leaked renders posted by OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;. The Xperia 1 III’s rear camera bump appears similar to its predecessor’s at first glance. But if you look closely at the bottom camera, it features a squared-off housing consistent with periscope designs. Previous Xperia phones have offered standard telephoto lenses with 2x or 3x optical zoom; a periscope design would allow for 5x or more of optical reach without sacrificing image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VT9iw"&gt;OnLeaks also reports that the Xperia 1 III will include 5G, practically a requirement for any flagship phone in 2021. Unlike the Xperia 1 II, it seems likely that Sony will offer 5G support for 1 III devices sold in the US, given that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248440/sony-xperia-pro-5g-price-release-date-news-features"&gt;creator-focused Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; will offer it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2w1u5"&gt;On the whole, it looks like the Xperia 1 III will stick with Sony’s minimalist approach. The 6.5-inch display’s bezels are very thin, and Sony is sticking with the tall 21:9 aspect ratio. The 1 III should also retain the 3.5mm headphone jack — a rarity among flagships — as well as a microSDXC card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rULqlb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10308187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4RRT8o"&gt;Despite being a major manufacturer of imaging hardware, Sony’s phones have lagged behind other flagships in the camera department with better software. When we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;reviewed the Xperia 1 II&lt;/a&gt;, we saw an opportunity for Sony to lean into the dedicated camera-like experience that the phone can offer, rather than trying to play catch-up on computational photography. Strengthening its hardware offerings with a good-quality zoom is a solid step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate to hold hearing on the stock market after Reddit GameStop squeeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Confirmation Hearing For Federal Reserve Governor Nominees Judy Shelton And Christopher Waller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/55kLcgKtLSY7SuY8lEUgcjTCD50=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736290/1200544025.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKfgqn"&gt;Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), the incoming chair of the Senate Banking Committee, announced Thursday that he plans to hold a hearing on the “current state of the stock market” in the wake of unprecedented volatility around GameStop, AMC, and other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga0Oaz"&gt;The volatility has been most pronounced around the retailer GameStop, which has more than quadrupled in value over the past week in the face of a Reddit-organized campaign to boost the company’s value. But with several markets blocking further purchases of the stock to stem hedge fund losses, the incident has sparked a broader conversation about institutional bias in US financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0Aod3"&gt;“People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they’re the ones getting hurt. American workers have known for years the Wall Street system is broken — they’ve been paying the price,” Brown said in a statement Thursday. “It’s time for the SEC and Congress to make the economy work for everyone, not just Wall Street. That’s why, as incoming Chair of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee I plan to hold a hearing to do that important work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7j5N4z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW: Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on "the current state of the stock market," incoming Chairman Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CX1zj8HHVo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CX1zj8HHVo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Flatley (@DanielPFlatley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanielPFlatley/status/1354881143896760326?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpKNBd"&gt;As of publication, it’s unclear when the hearing will take place, but lawmakers from both chambers have expressed a need for further investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ae6rP"&gt;Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), the chair of the House Financial Services committee, also pledged to investigate the activity. “I will convene a hearing to examine recent activity around GameStop stock and other impacted stocks,” Waters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elwasson/status/1354902287488057344"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, “with a focus on short selling, online trading platforms, gamification and their systemic impact on our capital markets and retail investors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFox91"&gt;Earlier Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;called on Congress to investigate&lt;/a&gt; the Robinhood app, calling the actions against GameStop “unacceptable.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Other progressives have followed suit. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) put out a statement saying, “We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,” he continued. “We need more regulation and equality in the markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROKsuH"&gt;On Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) also called for further regulation of the financial industry. “It’s long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs — and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UGTBi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Rep. Waters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carrot Weather gets a fresh new design and a bigger shift to subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lN5sEiwjI5IK8EZ6izco50_DCZk=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735971/promo_presets.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Brian Mueller&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xQwx6x"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id961390574"&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/a&gt; — the entertainingly antagonistic weather application from developer Brian Mueller — just got its latest version 5.0 update, which brings a whole new (and far more customizable) design, removes the upfront price tag in favor of more subscription tiers, and, of course, adds new dialogue and Easter eggs for the app’s malevolent AI character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yQnbD"&gt;It’s been a few years since Mueller released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16004062/carrot-weather-4-update-ai-app-ios-dark-sky-forecast-fun"&gt;Carrot Weather 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, and the new update brings a fresh coat of paint to the weather app, with more detailed data that’s broken down into individual cards for things like Moon phases, wind speed, precipitation, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1X8ykyctXGF42743dYRBl-wtWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266256/promo_darkmode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Brian Mueller&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jWF0FT"&gt;Users are also able to fully customize the layout of those interface cards based on the information that’s important to them, and they can swap between different custom layouts easily. (For example, a frequent skier might want to build a layout that focuses on snowfall and wind speed forecasts.) Everything has been visually updated to be more in line with modern iOS UI standards so the whole app will fit more seamlessly alongside the rest of your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D3plc"&gt;The new app also is now free to use, instead of charging $4.99 upfront to use. Like the old paid version, though, there are still optional subscription services that can be layered on top for more functionality. A Premium subscription ($4.99 per month or $19.99 per year) adds additional features like selecting weather sources, notifications, widgets, and Apple Watch complications. Premium Ultra ($9.99 per month or $39.99 per year) adds notifications for rain and storms, more widgets, and better data source switching. And a Premium Family subscription ($14.99 per month or $59.99 per year) is the same as Premium Ultra but can be shared through Apple’s Family Sharing with up to five other people. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpEbtzKe9hOWCGws3PMTt12NKzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266257/promo_interfacemaker.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Brian Mueller&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot’s new customizable Interface Maker tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FQchb8"&gt;If you’ve already been a Carrot owner, though, you’ll get to keep any paid features you already had forever, even if they’ve been moved to one of the pricier tiers. Similarly, existing subscribers to the old Premium Club memberships will be able to continue to pay those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18632642/carrot-weather-app-update-precipitation-notifications-rain-snow-storm-cell-custom-critical-alerts"&gt;lower monthly or yearly prices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlPmy5"&gt;The free version of Carrot Weather includes ads — but for now, they’re either for entirely fake products or for other indie applications. (Mueller says he’s not getting paid for those, either, but views them as a way of “giving back to the awesome indie developer community.”) That said, he notes that he may end up selling ads in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qKEI0"&gt;Carrot Weather 5.0 is available to download now on the App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
