    <title>Ford’s e-scooter company is pulling out of any city that doesn’t limit competition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tiMs4LbycObCJIvgQf7WBrH380c=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361703/61d884086c3dcf21a4f5f774_Scooters_p_1080.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The decision will impact “roughly” a quarter of the company’s staff.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HkBldN"&gt;Spin, the e-scooter company owned by Ford, announced a major restructuring Friday where it will pull out of “nearly all open permit markets.” More specifically, Spin is beginning to exit “a few” US markets, Germany, and Portugal, and it is “projecting” to close down in Spain as soon as February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkY4nJ"&gt;Moving forward, Spin says it will focus on “limited vendor markets,” where only a designated number of scooter companies are allowed to compete in a location, in the US, Canada, and the UK. Spin sees “double the revenue per vehicle” in limited vendor markets, &lt;a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward"&gt;according to Ben Bear, Spin’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tJV1l7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This decision to restructure impacts roughly a quarter of our staff”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9zKTc"&gt;“This decision to restructure impacts roughly a quarter of our staff,” Bear said, which appears to mean they will be laid off. Bear said Spin will offer severance packages to “affected employees,” along with “an additional stipend that may be allocated for outplacement services.” He added that staff who had been issued company laptops will be allowed to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wiflwa"&gt;Bear complained about “open permit markets,” which allow multiple scooter companies to operate in a market. They apparently proved tough competition for Spin. Bear said the market dynamics “make it difficult to identify a clear path to profitability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKbR1W"&gt;Spin was acquired by Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/7/18073046/ford-electric-scooter-spin-acquisition"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced an aggressive expansion plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8929994/ford-spin-scooter-expansion-next-gen-model"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and expanded to Europe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155719/spin-ford-electric-scooter-sharing-company-cologne-germany-launch"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Following Friday’s announcement, though, it seems that the company is switching its focus for the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4_l39DGwYmgazbTsBa7JXG8W0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_211006_4796_0061.15.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 currently starts at $369 instead of $399.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch to help you achieve your New Year’s fitness goals? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. Apple’s latest wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models seems too expensive, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a decent entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and solid build quality — especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range — but it’s also not one we would recommend picking up at this point. The design is aging, the processor is slower, and its paltry 8GB of internal storage hampers some of the more recent features introduced to the Apple Watch, like the ability to store music and podcasts for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSKChG"&gt;If you still want to go this route, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Gen-3-Series-3-38mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Black-Sport-Band-MTF02LL-A%2F706203065%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 in black by $50, bringing the price down to $159. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgdJbF1VDYU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same model with the space gray aluminum case and black Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm6hYBluei" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver aluminum case with a white Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, for $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $179 in white and at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $199 in black instead of $229. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ryWZk"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped Watch SE with a space gray aluminum case and the midnight Sport Band from &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1159614/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F645876604&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $229&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $10 shy of the lowest price we’ve ever seen this model go for. You can also buy the same configuration in select colorways for $249 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1llTisAz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The GPS and LTE versions of this size are discounted at both retailers as well, selling for $299 instead of $329 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1AJ5SW4B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G95JSRJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and Best Buy is throwing in an additional month of Apple’s $9.99-a-month fitness service, Apple Fitness Plus, with each purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review Apple Fitness Plus review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebnXzp"&gt;For larger wrists, Walmart is selling the bigger, 44mm, GPS model with the silver aluminum case and blue Sport Band for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F634588522&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269 instead of $309&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is also selling the same configuration but in different styles for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1UifrrO3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279&lt;/a&gt;, along with the cellular and GPS variants for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1VZLc9hy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$329 instead of $350&lt;/a&gt;. Like the smaller model, each comes four months of Apple Fitness Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Dmq74g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. Right now, Walmart is selling the 40mm, GPS-enabled model for $349 in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals1722&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F386345423&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer was also selling the larger, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm version with GPS in red for $299&lt;/a&gt;, but it has since sold out. Instead, you can buy it in an assortment of colorways for around $429 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155142/2092?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatch172022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-aluminum-case%2F-%2FA-81498743%3Fpreselect%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm7aAnar8H" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is throwing in an additional month of Apple Fitness Plus with each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. Right now, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model for $369 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the cellular version is selling for $459 instead of $499 in select styles at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6QF5J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F969328673&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBoAQG"&gt;If you prefer the larger, 45mm variant with GPS, it’s currently available in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $399 instead of $429. The larger, 45mm model with support for GPS and cellular is also going for $509 instead of $529 in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207219/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals121721&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-Cellular-45mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F637310631%3Fathbdg%3DL1700&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFM35F9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbDgH"&gt;Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models. However, we are currently seeing a rare sale on the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 with the stainless steel case. Right now, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;45mm version is on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $629 ($120 off), an all-time low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ARKcVr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="hjNY0P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s new charger provides 165W to four ports and has a cute stand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-NZ9NF7QbqYuPeCs8SFiaU0RIo=/0x471:2500x2138/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361454/p.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This charger can provide a single device with 100W, even with two other devices plugged in.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Satechi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n3zSlO"&gt;Satechi &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2F165w-usb-c-4-port-pd-gan-charger%3Fvariant%3D39787940905048&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F7%2F22872565%2Fsatechi-gan-4-port-usb-c-165w-charger-desktop-stand-macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced a charger&lt;/a&gt; with some interesting specs: it has four USB-C ports capable of supplying 165 watts of power at once, and it will sell for $120. It’s capable of pumping out 100W of power for a single device and can even do that while charging one or two other devices, depending on the power they draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KTRuZ"&gt;That’s impressive, given that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852051/anker-usb-c-4-port-120w-power-brick-547-charger"&gt;120W Anker brick we wrote about last month&lt;/a&gt; (which also had four ports) wasn’t capable of doing the same — it could only charge at a 60W / 30W / 20W split, where the Satechi can do 100W / 30W / 30W. It can also provide two devices with 60W and give the third 45W if you’re more into charging a few lighter-weight computers at a time — for example, maybe a 13-inch MacBook Pro, a Chromebook, and a MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAuKkchQ-MawTjXFIMx2aUe4qaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153572/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the charger lays out the various configurations you can use it in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt67kP"&gt;That 100W charging will go away if you hook up four devices, though — from there, it’ll drop to putting out 60W / 45W / 30W / 30W. Still, that’s not bad for a device that weighs 12 ounces (or around 340 grams), according to its spec sheet. If you’re one to carry a lot of USB-C devices with you while traveling, the Satechi could be a good way to charge them all up at once without having to juggle multiple bricks and outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlWleP"&gt;All that juice is great and everything, but my favorite feature has to be the little stand that comes with it to hold it upright on a desk. Not only would it make the charger easier to use as a home charging station, but it also makes it look like a cute little robot (at least to my eyes). It may also help with boring things like cable management, keeping the detachable charging cable away from the up to four USB-C cables coming out from the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O451QoY2__XS0BpzghvRnI0OSdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153576/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satechi’s really made this charger stand out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vr1lwR"&gt;The charger is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2F165w-usb-c-4-port-pd-gan-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F7%2F22872565%2Fsatechi-gan-4-port-usb-c-165w-charger-desktop-stand-macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to preorder on Satechi’s website&lt;/a&gt; for $120, but the company says you can get 20 percent off by using the code “CES20” until January 13th, bringing the price down to $96 before any applicable taxes and shipping. According to the product page, the US version will ship by January 14th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tq98Xx"&gt;If you don’t need quite as much power and portage, Satechi sells a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-USB-C-3-Port-Wall-Charger/dp/B0988TCFGW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;66W three USB-C port charger for $55&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866945/anker-nano-ii-100w-usb-c-736-charger-smallest-ces-2022"&gt;Anker also announced&lt;/a&gt; a $79 100W charger with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port at CES, claiming that it’ll be the “world’s smallest 100W gallium nitride wall charger.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixar’s Turning Red is ditching theaters to premiere on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYXhF7m4z7HyBSwCQwEiZcfFvk0=/0x0:1023x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361018/turningred_pixar.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pixar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Mqj4a"&gt;Late last year, movie studios seemed set on returning to theatrical premieres for all movies for the first time since the pandemic started, but now &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-and-pixars-turning-red-to-premiere-exclusively-on-disney-on-march-11/"&gt;Disney has announced&lt;/a&gt; a change of plans for an upcoming family flick, Pixar’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22575165/turning-red-disney-pixar-trailer-panda-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of coming to theaters on March 11th, now it “will premiere exclusively in homes worldwide” on Disney Plus, but still on March 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="b8n8BG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Disney and Pixar’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TurningRed?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TurningRed&lt;/a&gt; will stream exclusively on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; beginning March 11. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QrOKVtkktY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QrOKVtkktY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney+ (@disneyplus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1479552297831055361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1AhS1"&gt;There’s no plan for a Premier Access video-on-demand setup like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365053/mulan-disney-plus-cost-streaming-new-trailer-churn-subscriber-premier-access"&gt;the company arranged for &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, it will be available to all subscribers in the same way that Pixar’s last two animated features, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22406133/pixar-luca-sea-monsters-transformation-interview-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were (the Disney Animation production &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698341/disney-encanto-animation-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;premiered in theaters for Thanksgiving, with a 30-day run that saw it arrive on Disney Plus in time for Christmas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dctGoZ"&gt;Disney Media &amp;amp; Entertainment Distribution chairman Kareem Daniel was seen announcing theatrical releases for many 2021 movies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22668326/disney-movies-exclusive-theatrical-streaming-black-widow-eternals-johansson"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but in a statement about &lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt;, he now says, “Given the delayed box office recovery, particularly for family films, flexibility remains at the core of our distribution decisions as we prioritize delivering the unparalleled content of The Walt Disney Company to audiences around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8d1bAB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Movie theaters are breaking records thanks to Spider-Man, even as omicron spreads ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22843051/movie-theaters-spider-man-no-way-home-records-amc-regal-cinemark"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B53Vlt"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; broke box office records less than a month ago, a spike in COVID-19 cases driven by the omicron variant and lackluster performances by non-Spider-Man flicks could push certain films back to streaming premieres. Or they could be pushed into another set of extended delays, like Sony Pictures’ &lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22867135/morbius-movie-delayed-why"&gt;recently adjusted its release date from January 28th to April 1st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is giving you homework to learn about its privacy settings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h33qKdotN1MdhnU_MzMRAqjcOw0=/25x0:865x560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360771/01_Privacy_Center.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meta wants Privacy Center to be the place you go to access privacy and security controls.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V5BSnd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/introducing-privacy-center/"&gt;Meta (the company formerly known as Facebook) has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new version of its Privacy Center, which it says you can use to learn about how it collects and uses data and figure out how to navigate the myriad privacy and security controls available. It says the current version of the tool will have categories covering security, sharing, collection, data use, and ads. While it seems like a good tool to have around, it does feel more like Meta is putting the onus on users to make sure its apps work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiq198"&gt;Meta says that this version of the Privacy Center (it’s had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16944304/facebook-privacy-eu-law-general-data-protection-regulation"&gt;various things called privacy centers in the past&lt;/a&gt;) is currently available to “some people using Facebook on desktop” but that it “will roll it out to more people and apps in the coming months.” According to the blog post, there will be five categories for guides and controls that let you manage your security settings, who your posts are shared with, how Meta collects and uses your info, and what your advertising profile and preferences are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0MbvFt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Having controls in one place and explanations for them is useful but isn’t a replacement for good defaults&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IVqO7Q"&gt;Having a centralized location for controls that otherwise might be spread out across a series of screens is nice, to be sure. That part of this project could genuinely be useful to users — when they get access to it — as the Facebook privacy settings can be unintuitive to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maxho0"&gt;However, Facebook’s emphasis on education (its press release uses the word “learn” nine times and also includes phrases like “brush up”) really puts the responsibility for the systems it builds onto the user. If the privacy or security settings aren’t what most users would want or expect, Meta will be able to say, “Well, we did give you the tools to learn about them.” Plus, it’s always possible that you won’t like the info you find in the privacy center but won’t be able to do anything about it if there’s not actually a setting to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFimz7"&gt;According to Meta, if you’ve got the new Privacy Center, you’ll be able to access it in Settings &amp;gt; Privacy, but Meta says it’ll “add more ways to access it in places where you may have privacy concerns.” It also says it’ll continue to add more modules and controls to Privacy Center as needed — hopefully, there won’t be a test to see how much you’ve retained.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is showing off the foldables of the future at CES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GABMbrADflCB0KQDm994LxD_LtI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360697/Screen_Shot_2022_01_07_at_9.27.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZmPbp"&gt;Samsung is arguably leading the charge on folding phones, and even though the first Galaxy Fold got off to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938653/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-updated-android-price-specs-features-hinge"&gt;a rocky start&lt;/a&gt;, last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; were impressive devices that delivered on the promise of how handy a device with a folding screen can be. But the company isn’t stopping with those form factors; at CES 2022, it showed off a bunch of prototype folding devices that could hint at foldables to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCzqCZ"&gt;Take the Flex S, a multi-foldable device that can stretch all the way out to a triple-wide screen. Or the Flex G, a pocket-sized device that folds &lt;em&gt;inward&lt;/em&gt; to protect the screen. There’s a device with a right rail that slides out to add some screen real estate. And Samsung even showed off a 17-inch folding laptop that’s not unlike the one Asus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867624/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-foldable-laptop-tablet-specs-price-release-date"&gt;announced at CES&lt;/a&gt; (though Asus is promising that its device will come out this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ90MF"&gt;There’s a lot to get excited about, and you can see Samsung’s latest foldable tech in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdwfCZ9XKY"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApO4Tc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>App claims to track blood pressure through a smartphone camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0gpmjeSOcYkEe3V51m2ofweC7G4=/0x65:1265x908/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360569/Binah.ai_Product.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Binah.ai built a blood pressure monitor into its health platform.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k2I6E1"&gt;Health platform Binah.ai &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prweb.com%2Freleases%2Fbinah_ai_unveils_video_based_contactless_blood_pressure_measurements_available_via_camera_of_smartphone_or_laptop%2Fprweb18409968.htm&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F7%2F22870128%2Fai-blood-pressure-camera-light-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt; that it added blood pressure monitoring to the suite of health tools available on its app, which is available through partnered businesses. The company says it can calculate blood pressure using only video of someone’s face through a smartphone or laptop camera — but experts say they need to see significantly more data from the company before they’d trust the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvWBRR"&gt;Tracking blood pressure without the usual cuff is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;longstanding goal&lt;/a&gt; for cardiologists and tech companies — it would eliminate a step in the process and could help people monitor their blood pressure at home more easily, which could be useful for people with some heart conditions. “We designed this to replace home cuff devices,” says David Maman, CEO and co-founder of Binah.ai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oA6xp"&gt;To monitor blood pressure, the tool analyzes the light reflected off of the face to calculate changes in blood flow — a technique called photoplethysmography (PPG). Device and app makers have leveraged that strategy on various body parts to calculate things like blood oxygen levels and heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxKtKR"&gt;Using it for blood pressure, though, is more challenging. Researchers are making &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.119.008857"&gt;progress&lt;/a&gt; toward that goal, but experts say that there’s still not enough data to show people can rely on this technique clinically. “I think it’s potentially feasible this technology could be used in the future, but have not seen evidence to suggest that this technology is at all ready for reliably checking blood pressure at this time,” Jordana Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who studies hypertension, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8M7tjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;but experts say that there’s still not enough data to show people can rely on this technique clinically&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RSBAfx"&gt;While PPG-based metrics can be good at tracking changes in blood pressure, it’s harder to use them to calculate the raw numbers without a baseline. That’s why most tools developed to measure blood pressure through PPG use a cuff for calibration. But Binah.ai’s approach doesn’t use any calibration. “We decided to design everything to work as a medical device,” Maman says. “When you have a blood pressure cuff, you don’t do any kind of calibration to it — you just use it. I think that’s the ideal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atABbO"&gt;Maman says the company has run internal validation studies of the blood pressure tool in 264 people. That data is not published, but the company shared “a basic accuracy report” with clients, he said. Their evaluation also benchmarked the device against the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.10237"&gt;international standard for blood pressure measuring devices&lt;/a&gt;, which has two levels: adequate for a high-accuracy device (like devices used in hospitals) and adequate for a low-accuracy device (like devices that could be used in the home). Binah.ai’s monitor uses the low-accuracy device standard, Maman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SP19t"&gt;Cohen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the international standard is designed for typical cuff-based blood pressure monitors and shouldn’t be used on its own to monitor the accuracy of a PPG-based tool. She said she’d need to see more published validation data before feeling comfortable with this type of device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiLYpl"&gt;There also needs to be published analysis on how the device works in people with different skin tones, who have facial hair, or who are wearing makeup, said Ann Marie Navar, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Not taking care to test artificial intelligence-based tools across multiple skin tones has led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;bias in other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/machine-learning-dermatology-skin-color/567619/"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;. And while experts know the best body positioning techniques for arm-based measurements, it’s not clear what the best approach would be for the face. “We have no idea what human factors impact the measurement accuracy of this type of approach,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zuQn3f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have no idea what human factors impact the measurement accuracy of this type of approach”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jrt253"&gt;Maman says the company will launch a more extensive clinical trial to test the device at the end of February and will use that data to pursue an approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Right now, the app is only able to be used as a wellness device, and the company can’t claim it can be used for medical purposes. Binah.ai also doesn’t sell its products directly to consumers but works with companies like insurers, which implement its tools on their own platforms. Maman says that the company is also working with two leading laptop manufacturers and a smartphone manufacturer to integrate Binah.ai into their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5on8K"&gt;The company decided to launch the feature before they did that additional study because customers told Binah.ai they wanted it. Many customers do their own internal validation on the tools, Maman says. “They say, we’ll check it, and if it’s good enough, it’s good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Elizabeth Holmes’ guilty verdict a wake-up call for startups?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cscyl9F8mbCqFCrVeRrQTbN3Gwk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360343/Theranos_Thumb_3_nobug.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hEtYxA"&gt;After a long trial, former Theranos CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867505/elizabeth-holmes-guilty-fraud-investing"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/a&gt; has been found guilty of four out of the 11 charges brought against her, including three counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud investors in her now-defunct blood testing company. The verdict caps a journey filled with both promises and disappointments, one that ultimately led to the downfall of what could have been one of the most successful companies, and entrepreneurs, to come out of Silicon Valley in over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YH0t5"&gt;While the verdict is a milestone in holding startup founders accountable for false promises, it actually further complicates the difference between fraud and the “fake it til you make it” mindset of many startups. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s deputy editor Liz Lopatto breaks down the outcome of the trial and what to expect in the months to come. With Holmes’ business partner, Sunny Balwani, getting ready to stand trial later this month, the story is far from over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos’ second-gen Symfonisk bookshelf speakers get a light refresh</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LHVqBWyxF9C865OB0U2dm6AnQjU=/81x0:1713x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360295/Screen_Shot_2022_01_07_at_1.06.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKHdqg"&gt;Ikea has quietly updated its Sonos-partnered Symfonisk bookshelf speakers with a &lt;a href="https://www-ikea-com.translate.goog/nl/nl/p/symfonisk-wifi-boekenplankspeaker-wit-gen-2-50506587/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US"&gt;second-generation version&lt;/a&gt; that’s already available in the Netherlands, &lt;a href="https://tweakers-net.translate.goog/nieuws/191418/ikea-en-sonos-brengen-vernieuwde-symfonisk-boekenplankspeaker-uit.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US"&gt;via Dutch tech website &lt;em&gt;Tweakers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbhVuU"&gt;Unlike the recently revamped Symfonisk lamp, which added a brand new design, the second-gen bookshelf speakers are a more minor update: they still feature the same basic shelf-style design and compatibility with Sonos’ speaker network and Apple’s Airplay 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHkEAZ"&gt;Tweakers reports that Ikea’s made some internal changes, though, adding a faster processor, more memory, and lowering power consumption when in standby mode. It’s also added a longer power cable, which should be helpful for anyone trying to mount them in awkwardly wired rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4LVB6"&gt;But the biggest change (biggest being a relative term here) is the buttons, where Ikea has lightly updated the layout from the first-generation model, swapping the volume up and play / pause buttons so that the two volume buttons are now next to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N0ykTQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10966496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mr9OT6"&gt;But aside from those tweaks, Ikea doesn’t appear to be messing with the formula here too much. The new Symfonisk, like the original, still comes in both black and white color schemes and can be paired up in stereo in conjunction with the first-generation models, too, which is good to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwYwcL"&gt;It’s not clear when Ikea will be launching the new Symfonisk speakers globally, but the second-generational models &lt;a href="https://www-ikea-com.translate.goog/nl/nl/p/symfonisk-wifi-boekenplankspeaker-wit-gen-2-50506587/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US"&gt;are already available from Ikea’s Netherlands site for 99 euros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge Awards at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A virtual trophy for the Verge Awards at CES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qc2oysvWbodG6sbLnuGI04RfV6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70360081/acastro_4959_220107_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge Awards at CES | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The things that got us most excited, bewildered, and delighted at CES 2022&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="99diuZ"&gt;CES was supposed to be in person this year. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and countless other outlets had hotel rooms confirmed and airlines booked. Companies teased cool gadgets that would have made CES feel exciting again after the muted all-digital affair of 2021. But COVID surged and CES saw massive cancellations. Some companies pivoted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;digital booths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;others canceled keynotes, and a few just withdrew altogether&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/31/22861669/ces-2022-ends-early-covid-january-7"&gt;CES even announced it would end a day early&lt;/a&gt;. The return to normal CES might have heralded never materialized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiQVvO"&gt;But something else happened: the news that came out of CES actually got us excited. For the last two years we’ve ruminated on what the point of CES even is. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21058850/ces-2020-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget"&gt;In 2020&lt;/a&gt; we said CES was “a lot of show with not much very substance,” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22231489/ces-2021-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt; that statement was still on our minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuzIXa"&gt;But after a very muted CES 2020, followed by the very weird all-digital CES 2021, we were surprised to find the show was still capable of surprising and sometimes even delighting us. We can’t be sure what CES will look like in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5z74MU"&gt;But this year we can celebrate the very cool, and the very weird, and sometimes the just plain goofy gadgets that had us nostalgic for former Januaries in the Nevada desert.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rc30cTanxgklIfs31HX6IJwdW0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146138/Odyssey_Ark_side__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Odyssey Ark can be used in portrait orientation, which curves the screen above your head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yqvUTd"&gt;Best in Show:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="n7kQJp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;Samsung Odyssey Ark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="C9h0lC"&gt;It goes without saying that over the past two years, the humble&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;computer monitor has gained a new appreciation in many people’s eyes. It’s what makes working from home comfortable and productive; it allows us to play games from either our preferred consoles or a high-powered PC. It’s often the centerpiece of a home office setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jNIg1"&gt;So it’s no surprise that a monitor is what captured our attention at CES the most this year. Samsung’s Odyssey Ark is not just &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; monitor, though. It’s the combination of a number of trends in one package unlike any we’ve ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzBzOq"&gt;For starters, it’s huge: 55-inch screens may be commonplace on TVs, but they’re still rare for monitors. Second, it’s high res — its 4K resolution is enough for sharp text (at reasonable distances) and highly detailed imagery. And perhaps most importantly, it’s aggressively curved, wrapping the screen around (or, if you use it in the portrait orientation, above) you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQWeH7"&gt;It’s not Samsung’s first curved monitor — we’ve already seen multiple generations of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;Odyssey G9 and its wraparound view&lt;/a&gt; — but it is the largest, by a significant margin. The 16:9 aspect ratio makes it less ultrawide and more ultra large compared to monitors like the G9. Samsung’s demos of it in portrait orientation show it arcing above the viewer’s head, reminding me of how a Tesla’s windshield extends far beyond your line of sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwNdr6"&gt;Though we don’t yet know the price (don’t expect cheap) or when Samsung will deliver this, it’s easy to envision the immersive experience you can obtain with it, without having to deal with fussy VR goggles. I’ll take two of them, side by side in vertical orientation, please. — &lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert, deputy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-roaaPujzF3g5wlnVV42dPqs4Pw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142277/g14topdown.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0Mnl1r"&gt;Best Laptop:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="OiFGUB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22864968/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptop-2022-webcam-amd-16-10-aspect-ratio-specs-features"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tG5Nwu"&gt;Asus did it. It did everything we asked it to do. We in the laptop sphere have been giving the Zephyrus G14 crap for years about its lack of a webcam (and, therefore, its relative uselessness as a daily driver for many remote and hybrid workers), and Asus finally, &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;heard our pleas and stuck a webcam on the dang thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSDbJt"&gt;Asus also swapped out its RTX 3060 GPU for AMD’s Radeon 6800S. Armed with that chip and AMD’s new Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, it would not be at all shocking if this device was the top-performing 14-inch gaming laptop on the market this year with the best battery life to boot (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;the last all-AMD gaming laptop from Asus that I reviewed&lt;/a&gt; had unbelievable battery life and delivered the best battery gaming experience I’ve ever seen). Oh, and would you look at that — it even has a 16:10 aspect ratio, fixing basically the only other complaint I’ve ever had about the Zephyrus G14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlM90v"&gt;I know, I know — we’ve given Best Laptop of CES to a freaking Zephyrus G14 for two out of the past three years (and the third one was the Zephyrus G15, which is basically the same thing but slightly bigger). I fully understand if you are frustrated by how terribly predictable we’ve become. But I’m dead serious here — this has the potential to be the best gaming laptop that has ever hit the market. Previous Zephyrus G14 models have spent months at the top of our Best Gaming Laptop list, and that’s with a 16:9 aspect ratio and no webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCfpzU"&gt;Now, there are still a couple ways Asus and AMD could break my heart. Most notably, they could put some absurdly high price tag on this device. (Please, Asus and AMD, &lt;em&gt;please &lt;/em&gt;do not do me like that.) Alternatively, these new chips could just be bad. I hope they’re not bad, and I don’t expect them to be bad. If they’re good — if they’re even remotely good — this is the laptop of the year. — &lt;em&gt;Monica Chin, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kT_QU_GD_s2lxUHm4OJ8G96GIns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142431/2_way_Stand_A95K.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fezL5m"&gt;Best TV:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EwzP9v"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;Sony A95K QD-OLED 4K TV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="LbScmR"&gt;It’s not often that we see the debut of a new TV technology at CES that will find its way into actual products that same year, but that’s part of the excitement around Samsung Display’s QD-OLED displays: they’re coming to TVs and PC monitors in 2022. But oddly it’s not Samsung Electronics that’s leading the charge for a QD-OLED TV. Not yet, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AB7abY"&gt;At CES, Sony announced a flagship A95K QD-OLED 4K TV that’ll be available in both 65- and 55-inch sizes. It’ll combine the brand-new displays with Sony’s terrific image processing and best-in-class TV speaker system. And if QD-OLED delivers on its promise, the new TVs could outperform those from LG (and Sony’s own existing sets) at overall brightness, color consistency, and even viewing angles. And considering how phenomenal OLEDs already look, that’s no small feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQrzOj"&gt;But flashy new tech is always accompanied by a very high price tag. While QD-OLED won’t demand nearly the same premium as something truly next level like Micro LED, it’s still guaranteed to cost significantly more than any 4K OLED TV on the market right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwaBWy"&gt;Will it be worth it? We’ll have to wait to see the A95K in person to know for sure. — &lt;em&gt;Chris Welch, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCGQKXnTXsJtn2ul1IeZMn0S2V4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146140/Odyssey_Ark_above.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top-down view of the Ark monitor in landscape orientation lets you really see how aggressive the curve is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WzJksj"&gt;Best Monitor:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Pr7z37"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;Samsung Odyssey Ark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wjqpjz"&gt;I was ready to write off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;the Samsung Odyssey Ark&lt;/a&gt; as just another jaw-droppingly curved screen whose additional gimmick was a swivel so you could turn it on its side. I blame Samsung for that — the company provided only two pictures of this monitor to journalists covering the show remotely, and neither of them actually &lt;em&gt;showed&lt;/em&gt; the damned screen. They only revealed how the monitor curves like a scythe, which would be awesome &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/3/21047322/samsung-odyssey-g9-g7-curved-gaming-monitor-49-inch-qled-display-specs-ces-2020"&gt;if that were new&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkDLmh"&gt;Then, the pictures &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qbking77/status/1478555909068505088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1478555909068505088%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22867790%2Fsamsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;started coming in from the CES 2022 show floor&lt;/a&gt;, and I realized how wrong I was to lump it in with Samsung’s super-ultrawide monitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;like the Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt;. The reality looks more akin to a cockpit, or a curved wall of surveillance monitors, that can also turn into a single 55-inch curved 4K TV — one that can run games and many films at their preferred 16:9 aspect ratio instead of uncomfortably stretching them across an atypical 32:9 expanse of pixels. The hardware dial to rotate your array of virtual monitors across that wall of screen looks awesome, too, reducing the need to rely on special windowing software to get work done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AWhxD"&gt;I’m deathly afraid of the price tag, given how even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;Samsung’s $2,499 Neo G9 turned out to be something of a dud&lt;/a&gt;, but the Odyssey Ark looks destined to take the title of “ultimate monitor” if Samsung doesn’t screw it up. — &lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister, tech reports editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW’s big reveal was a car that can change its paint to various shades of gray using E Ink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IHc2WE"&gt;Best Concept:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oSi91o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867090/bmw-color-changing-paint-electric-car-ces"&gt;E Ink paint found on BWM iX concept car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="FWfm2l"&gt;A concept, by definition, is just a sketching of a cool future idea. What makes a concept the “best” is an execution. There needs to be more than 3D renders. Even if its just a one-off that’s more smoke and mirrors than reality, a concept needs to be at least a little tangible to get us excited. BMW’s “color changing paint” powered by the same E Ink technology found in the Kindle and Pebble, is tangible. There was a BMW at CES driving around and switching from “black” to “white” with ease. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/klwtts/status/1478531775886286848?s=20"&gt;It looked so good&lt;/a&gt; you half wonder when you’ll be able to get a car painted in E Ink. That doesn’t mean it will ever actually come to fruition. E Ink is still a display relying on pigment suspended in liquid. One bad hail storm or a ding in the Walmart parking lot and the very stunning effect produced by this paint is toast. There’s no word on how it would handle the color or the heat. Heck, the stuff is still monochromatic! But imagine a world where E Ink gets good at color. Imagine being able to customize the paint job of your car with your phone instead of going to a guy with a special garage and a whole lot of pigment. That’s undoubtedly cool. It may never be a reasonable reality, but I don’t mind being a little fanciful once and a while. — &lt;em&gt;Alex Cranz, managing editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NmLaJu"&gt;Normally, CES is awash with robot concepts, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16876086/sony-aibo-hands-on-video-ces-2018"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18175168/ces-2019-robots-best-worst-delivery-butler-tablet"&gt;bipedal humanoid vaporware&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054353/samsung-ballie-robot-ai-assistant-ces-2020"&gt;weird little balls with cameras attached&lt;/a&gt;. This year — with so few people attending — there’s less reason for companies to trot out their ideas for robots. Instead, there was just one robot that stood out and though it is not shipping anytime soon, it’s so simple and practical it has a better shot at becoming real than most of the concepts we see at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEqtus"&gt;It’s called the Labrador Retriever, and it’s simply a shelf on wheels that’s able to navigate around your house. It moves a little slowly, it doesn’t have lidar, but it can open a fridge and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22699251/amazon-astro-robot-cannot-fetch-your-beer"&gt;get you a beer&lt;/a&gt; (though only if you’ve added motors to the fridge door and put the beer on an accessible shelf). It does all this using off-the-shelf technology to solve a real problem: helping people with limited mobility move stuff around their house. Instead of shooting for the stars and landing on its face, Labrador has set an achievable goal to solve a real human need with technology that exists right now. — &lt;em&gt;Dieter Bohn, executive editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9BuZ9X"&gt;In recent years, Garmin’s done a lot to expand its wearable lineup beyond hardcore athletes. However, its Vivomove line of hybrid analog watches has generally been a weird mishmash of stylish watches that were too expensive for casual users and too casual for serious athletes. It was disappointing, considering how Garmin’s hidden display is among the coolest for hybrid analogs. That’s why the entry-level Vivomove Sport is great. It’s a cute watch, affordably priced at $179.99, and still gets you the bulk of Garmin’s in-depth health and fitness tracking. It’s best suited for casual users, but it finally feels like Garmin’s got the right mix of features, style, and durability. — &lt;em&gt;Victoria Song, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Masonite door combines multiple smart home gadgets into one front door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AOvJJh"&gt;Best Gadget for a Smart Home:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bgZcL1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858256/masonite-smart-door-ring-yales-ces-2022"&gt;Masonite Smart Door&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="arKi3W"&gt;What I love about the Masonite M-Pwr smart door is that it’s not &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; gadget, it’s &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the gadgets. This smart door puts every device you need to control the main access point to your home in one. A video doorbell, a smart lock, motion-activated smart lighting, even door sense capability to warn you when it’s left open. And it’s powered by your home, not hundreds of disposable batteries you have to change every six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZd9ga"&gt;While it’s not perfect (who wants to use three apps to control their front door?), it has what CES is all about: a lot of potential. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There’s so much to imagine can be done from here and that’s largely because the M-Pwr is a collaboration between three companies to create a genuinely useful solution for the smart home. Collaboration and interoperability are key to creating the smart homes in which we might one day all live. You could even say they really &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDTuWA"&gt;Currently, the M-Pwr is only available for new homes, so you won’t be able to pop down to Home Depot and buy this anytime soon. Even without the smarts, front doors are expensive (like thousands of dollars expensive). But this type of integrated solution is where the smart home is headed. Sensors, connectivity, and power built into our walls and doors, that’s the home of the future. —&lt;em&gt; Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, reviewer &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="m7GiTZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces"&gt;Chevy Equinox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="RYFNhv"&gt;There were a surprising number of new EVs announced this year: the ultra-lux, ultra-long-range &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22855555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-ev-range-ces-2022"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX&lt;/a&gt;; the very angry-looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866219/bmw-ix-m60-electric-vehicle-range-specs-date"&gt;BMW iX M60&lt;/a&gt;; the aerodynamic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22862387/chrysler-electric-only-2028-airflow-concept-ces-2022"&gt;Chrysler Airflow&lt;/a&gt;; and, of course, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P72xq1"&gt;But I’m giving the award for best new EV to a car that not only was announced months before CES but didn’t even physically appear at the show: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces"&gt;Chevy Equinox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGvXAj"&gt;There’s a perception that electric vehicles are luxury items, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that most of the new EVs announced over the past few years retail for well over $50,000. So when General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Equinox, due out in 2023, would come with a $30,000 sticker price, it’s something worth noting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCSWQx"&gt;The Tesla Model 3 was supposed to be the game-changer, and in many ways it was. But the much-hyped $35,000 version only made a brief appearance before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569524/tesla-model-3-35000-price-stop-selling"&gt;vanishing into the good night&lt;/a&gt;. Now the cheapest Model 3 starts at $44,990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYTCVm"&gt;It will take more than one company to turn all 280 million cars and trucks in the US today into EVs. They can’t all be $105,000 trucks or $180,000 sports cars. We need electric Toyota Camrys, electric Kia Rios, and electric Mitsubishi Mirages. We need beaters, jalopies, and clunkers to go along with our sports cars and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;crab-walking Hummers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVsNv8"&gt;The Chevy Equinox is a good start. Let’s just hope GM doesn’t pull some shit and try to sell a $50,000 premium trim before eventually rolling out the base model. — &lt;em&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung is doing NFTs now because of course it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yKVeR6"&gt;Most Samsung:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="L3Ebvd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858698/samsung-2022-tvs-nft-support-announced-cryptocurrency"&gt;NFT Support on Samsung TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6BwDI3"&gt;Samsung’s 2022 TV lineup has a lot of good additions (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;like the Frame’s new matte coating&lt;/a&gt;), some weird additions (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860390/samsung-eco-remote-2022-solar-rf-harvesting-charging"&gt;like its Wi-Fi harvesting remotes&lt;/a&gt;), and some strangely missing additions (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;like a Samsung-branded set using the company’s new QD-OLED technology&lt;/a&gt;). And then there were the NFTs, which Samsung — for reasons known only to the company — is touting as a key part of its 2022 sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhTAeN"&gt;Samsung’s NFT support would have been an odd addition if it was just enabling the ability to &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; an NFT (which, in virtually all the cases that would make sense here, are still images or GIFs). But it’s the sort of thing that almost makes sense, if you squint at it hard enough. Its Frame TVs offer the feature of displaying art as a way to blend into the background, and what are NFTs if not very aesthetically awful and largely algorithmically generated art? But Samsung didn’t stop there. It added the ability to browse and buy NFTs, too. Nothing says a lovely evening on the couch like dropping hundreds of thousands of dollars on a pixelated JPEG using a TV remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSjUud"&gt;The addition of NFTs to its 2022 CES announcements is quintessentially Samsung: big, flashy, weird, months late to a trend, and likely doomed to end up in the Bixby-sized trash bin of other hype-chasing CES additions. — &lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg, senior reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="nhJz2L"&gt;In Apple’s iPhone XS event in 2018, it had a &lt;em&gt;Mission Impossible&lt;/em&gt;-style opening show to deliver a secret case to CEO Tim Cook… and at the end of the sequence there was a locked door that the agent could not access. Then up comes Apple VP of technology Kevin Lynch, who opens the door with an Apple Watch tap. Since then, the ability to actually unlock a door with just an Apple Watch has been close to impossible, but with the Schlage Encode Plus door lock it could be finally easy to live that dream. It’s the first deadbolt that supports Apple’s Home Key door access feature. It’s also good looking with various finishes and has an integrated keypad for more unlock options. — &lt;em&gt;Umar Shakir, Verge fellow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An OLED TV for smaller rooms, finally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wPuM7D"&gt;Best Thing We’ve Always Wanted and Was Finally Announced:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9aCDi7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG C Series 42-inch OLED&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="DuMc2T"&gt;LG finally gave us the smaller flagship OLED that we’ve wanted since it released the not too big but not terribly compact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051516/lg-new-oled-4k-8k-tv-gx-cx-bx-ces-2020"&gt;48-inch TV in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwQd0u"&gt;There are plenty of reasons for wanting a smaller, yet still high-end TV. At &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of us dream about using it as a gaming monitor, and who could blame us? OLED looks stunning, and its fast pixel response times stack with the TV’s 120Hz refresh rate to make a gaming experience that feels buttery smooth (if you’ve got the hardware to run it). But that dream has always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;been slightly out of reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJvuUA"&gt;Of course, gaming isn’t the only thing you’d want a 42-inch TV for. Some of us have pined for one because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640058/lg-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-delayed-ces-2022"&gt;we want a high-end TV that can fit in a small space&lt;/a&gt; or that won’t dominate a living room. Forty-eight inches felt close but not quiiite there (kind of like the iPhone 11 Pro did before the 12 Mini came out). Will 42 inches fit that sweet spot? Only time will tell, but there are a lot of people here who are at least considering finding out for themselves. — &lt;em&gt;Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TP-Link router that moves its antennas is most definitely a gimmick, but a cool gimmick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VDgE3t"&gt;Best Gimmick:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="yCuKwS"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858926/tp-link-archer-axe200-omni-wifi-6e-ces-2022"&gt;TP-Link Archer AXE200 Omni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wpcfMs"&gt;Does it actually matter which way you point the antennas on your router? After years of fiddling and even &lt;a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/455/"&gt;relying&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/answers/4-wi-fi-tips-from-former-apple-wi-fi-engineer"&gt;expert advice&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure, but a router that does the work on its own might be the best choice. The Archer AXE200 has four motorized blades that seek out the best signal possible, and even if that never adds a single megabit to download speeds, it looks cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUUOfw"&gt;Beyond the motorized party trick, the router is also ready for Wi-Fi 6E with a 6GHz radio on board, so there’s at least one legitimate reason to make the upgrade. Still, it’s probably better if I skip this one — I’ll burn those motors out within a week at the maximum. — &lt;em&gt;Richard Lawler, senior news editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="47Ky3z"&gt;Against the advice of my hair dressers, I bleached and dyed my own hair several times during quarantine. It left my sparkling white bathroom a poor imitation of a purple-and-pink Jackson Pollock painting. That’d have been fine if the result was nice. Reader, it was patchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ld6zj1"&gt;That’s why I’m stoked about the L’Oreal Colorsonic. Even color application by brushing a gadget through your hair? Even a dingus like me can do that. Replaceable cartridges that can be used multiple times and wastes a lot less plastic? Sign me up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNzCOQ"&gt;Sure, I could go to a professional at a salon. But the last time I went I was quoted $600 and it wasn’t even at a super fancy place. Doing it at home is a pain, but it’s also under $100, and under $50 for touchups. I would, however, happily pay more for a gadget to make the process easier. We don’t know how much the Colorsonic will cost, but L’Oreal told me it’s set to launch under the L’Oreal Paris brand and is supposed to be the sort of hair care gadget you can buy at Target. I would 100 percent plunk down my hard-earned moolah if the price was right (aka, less than $600).  — &lt;em&gt;Victoria Song, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Sre3iR"&gt;Best Thing We’d Actually Buy, Part 2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Bmb48X"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds"&gt;Samsung Freestyle Projector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="0XvBAk"&gt;Portable projectors aren’t anything new, but Samsung’s new Freestyle looks so fun and easy that it’s an immediate standout at CES 2022. It’s small enough that you can take it anywhere, making the potential use cases seem endless. Whether you want to stream Netflix on your ceiling, bring it on a camping trip, or use the Freestyle as a projector for your PC or laptop, it’s all doable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYlSAV"&gt;You can set the picture size anywhere between 30 and 100 inches. And the device automatically makes sure you’re getting the best image with auto-focus and auto-leveling. It comes with what Samsung claims is a “powerful” 360-degree speaker, and since it runs the same platform as the company’s smart TVs, you should be able to install a ton of apps on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MFHY7"&gt;Samsung seems determined to make the Freestyle &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than a mere projector; it’s also launching accessories that convert it into a moody smart light, as well as an adapter for plugging it right into a light socket for easy power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SY9ZCj"&gt;The Freestyle has all the makings of a fun-as-hell gadget. But the hurdle it’s facing is its price. At $899, it might be positioned in an awkward spot: too expensive for a fun toy and too cheap to cut it as a truly solid projector. — &lt;em&gt;Chris Welch, reviewer &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
