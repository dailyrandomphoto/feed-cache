    <title>FBI used facial recognition to identify a Capitol rioter from his girlfriend’s Instagram posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qyZST6sbqbCc1L8CKExeuVZWzD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161461/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UyERdM"&gt;The FBI says it used facial recognition technology to track down and arrest an individual suspected of taking part in the US Capitol riots earlier this year. The case, which was &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/facial-recognition-capitol-defendants_n_607f34c0e4b0df3610c17614?ri18n=true"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is notable for the FBI’s acknowledgement that it used facial recognition not just to confirm a suspect’s identity, but to discover it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnB3od"&gt;According to an &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20665075-41f45c66-98d7-46c3-b08e-ae4b81a1f8c1"&gt;affidavit&lt;/a&gt; shared online by the &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, federal agents tracked down an individual named Stephen Chase Randolph using crowdsourced images from the riots (including those shared on Twitter by a group known as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SeditionHunters"&gt;SeditionHunters&lt;/a&gt;). They searched these pictures on the web using “an open source facial recognition tool, known to provide reliable results,” and this led to a public Instagram page apparently belonging to Randolph’s girlfriend which contained “numerous images” of the suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWPDaeeJSIqwDqhh_SPv3wpuVUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459136/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_11.06.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20665075-41f45c66-98d7-46c3-b08e-ae4b81a1f8c1" target="_blank"&gt;FBI Affidavit&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/facial-recognition-capitol-defendants_n_607f34c0e4b0df3610c17614?ri18n=true" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FBI agents found an Instagram page apparently belonging to Randolph’s girlfriend using “open source facial recognition.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TLD9TN"&gt;Pictures on the account showed Randolph wearing the same items of clothing as in stills captured at the Capitol. These included a grey knitted hat with the Carhartt logo embroidered in white on the front. This hat was key for tracking Randolph’s activities across multiple videos and images, leading to SeditionHunters dubbing him #GrayCarharttHat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pI2zlH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The SUBJECT then continued to assault two other USCP officers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8n2Fe3"&gt;The FBI affidavit says Randolph was seen assaulting multiple US Capitol Police officers. “In the process of pushing the barricades to the ground, the SUBJECT and others knocked over a USCP Officer [...] causing [her] head to hit the stairs behind her, resulting in loss of consciousness,” says the report. “The SUBJECT then continued to assault two other USCP officers by physically pushing, shoving, grabbing, and generally resisting the officers and interfering with their official duties of protecting the closed and restricted US Capitol grounds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhxEi8"&gt;After finding Randolph’s girlfriend’s Instagram account, federal agents found Facebook accounts apparently belonging to his family members, revealing Randolph’s full name. They then cross-referenced his identity with state driving license records and surveilled him at his home and workplace, where he was spotted still wearing the same Carhartt hat.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20665075-41f45c66-98d7-46c3-b08e-ae4b81a1f8c1" target="_blank"&gt;FBI Affidavit&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/facial-recognition-capitol-defendants_n_607f34c0e4b0df3610c17614?ri18n=true" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FBI tracked down Randolph to his workplace, where he was interviewed by undercover agents. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H06gVf"&gt;To confirm Randolph’s participation in the riots, two undercover FBI agents approached him at his work on April 13. They struck up a conversation with Randolph in which he admitted to attending the riots, saying “I was in it” and “It was fucking fun.” Randolph also said he’d seen a female police officer being pushed over by the barricades, and suggested that the officer had suffered a concussion because she’d curled up into the fetal position. Randolph was arrested in Kentucky a week after this interview took place, says &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYvElq"&gt;The case shows how the FBI is using facial recognition and crowdsourced images to track down those who participated in the January 6 riots. Such tools are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295301/philadelphia-protester-arson-identified-social-media-etsy-instagram-linkedin"&gt;not always necessary&lt;/a&gt; to find suspects, but their use appears to be becoming increasingly common. A report from &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-local-police-facial-recognition"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; revealed that some 1,803 publicly funded agencies, including local and state police, tested controversial facial recognition service Clearview AI prior to February 2020. The technology has only become more widely known since.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Any video conferencing app can use the iPad Pro’s fancy zoom and pan camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WzipxLaS7ueC_Y9xzx7EXXkc9IQ=/0x26:600x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161443/Center_stage_ipad.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro’s front-facing camera can digitally pan and tilt to track video conference participants.&lt;/em&gt; | Video: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mFm6sw"&gt;Apple has confirmed that the digital pan and zoom feature of the new M1 iPad Pro’s front-facing camera can work with any video conferencing app, not just FaceTime. That opens the door for popular apps like Zoom and Microsoft Teams to make remote work and e-learning blend more seamlessly into the realities of pandemic life — a hybrid lifestyle that’s likely to continue even after the outbreak subsides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHdkaS"&gt;Center Stage, as Apple brands it, keeps video conferencing participants properly framed even as they move about a room by combining machine learning with a fixed 12-megapixel sensor touting an ultra-wide 122‑degree field of view. We’ve seen similar tracking on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Portal TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Xbox Kinect accessory. But those are niche devices compared to the iPad, which saw sales surge last year as students and remote workers snapped the tablets up in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTFsN"&gt;“Center Stage works with FaceTime and other video conferencing apps,” says Apple on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipad-pro%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395325%2Fipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro landing page&lt;/a&gt;. Apple missed its chance to scale FaceTime to compete with the likes of Zoom and Teams by reneging on its promise to make it an industry standard in favor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;ecosytem lock-in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m2tpdGV2oDI6nPCbtkc4DhWyros=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459122/lcimg_b1916176_0880_4bb5_9b1c_bfaee6cd2f4d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultra-wide front-facing camera is still located at the “top” of the new iPad Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQG24u"&gt;Apple demonstrated Center Stage with two participants, both of whom are recognized and framed appropriately as they move about a kitchen, on a FaceTime call with a third. It’s a good demo; the COVID-19 pandemic has blended work and life so hard that it’s now fairly common to see people making dinner during a Zoom meeting across international time zones, or a kid asking for a parent’s help during a Teams school lesson. Tech like Center Stage can help further infuse this sense of humanity into our otherwise stoic professional and educational pursuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuwYuF"&gt;Unfortunately, the position of the front-facing camera, even on the new M1 iPad Pro, makes participants appear to be staring off to the side when used with a keyboard dock, as is common for business and school uses. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;iPadOS creates other frustrations&lt;/a&gt; for video conferences. Hopefully the iPad Pro is just a start and we’ll see ultra-wide Center Stage cameras coming to the much maligned, but better positioned, MacBook webcams soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gogoro is bringing its electric scooter and battery tech to India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2sXPAzQZ1UEE3MxyperM3zYkojM=/374x0:2618x1496/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161381/Gogoro_Swap_Girl_L.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Gogoro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sNGQEf"&gt;Gogoro is branching out of home country Taiwan in the biggest way yet, as it just announced a partnership with major two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotorCorp to bring its swappable battery and scooter tech to India. As part of the deal, Hero will build electric scooters based around Gogoro’s tech, and will also install Gogoro’s battery-swapping stations in cities throughout the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DRwxx"&gt;Electric vehicles could help eat away at some of India’s pollution, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/why-tesla-faces-an-uphill-battle-in-india-.html"&gt;Tesla is even wading into the market&lt;/a&gt;. But building out charging infrastructure to handle passenger EVs is going to be a challenge for any company that wants to build a business there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1yx4A"&gt;It’s a different story for scooters, and especially the ones made by Gogoro, which was founded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;a pair of former HTC executives a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, electric scooters are smaller and draw less power. And Gogoro’s scooters are powered by swappable batteries that owners drop off and pick up at public stations the size of a typical vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGJVhUpJvcQxy7FBiEBqX5jG-tY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458815/Gogoro_Swap_Battery_L.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NBz1gC"&gt;Gogoro has spent the last few years encouraging industry giants like Yamaha and Suzuki to hasten the switch to electric power by striking deals with them to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/gogoro-announces-yamaha-aeon-and-pgo-are-the-first-manufacturers-that-will-use-its-swappable-batteries-in-their-own-scooters/"&gt;license its plug-and-play batteries&lt;/a&gt;. But the partnership with Hero is more involved, as the two companies will actually create a joint venture in India to make the scooters and build out the battery swap stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgS8Ue"&gt;Gogoro also pitches its battery stations as a way to aid the local energy grid during times of peak demand. The company says it has installed 2,000 stations across Taiwan, which in total see about 265,000 daily battery swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJLBoU"&gt;The popularity of electric two-wheelers is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-04-20/hyperdrive-daily-the-ev-revolution-rides-on-two-wheels?utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;booming in China&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re starting to make big gains in other markets like Vietnam and South Korea. In comparison, they’re practically absent in India. Partnering with Hero is a way to quickly change that. The New Delhi-based manufacturer leads the world in units sold when it comes to motorcycles and scooters, and it has an extensive presence in India that goes far beyond the biggest cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS7tMp"&gt;“No other place on Earth has more people moving around on fossil fuel-burning two-wheelers than India,” Gogoro founder and CEO Horace Luke said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkldUp"&gt;Two-wheeled vehicles account for an enormous amount of individual miles traveled in India, Luke said, and therefore are a huge source of gasoline consumption. And since Hero doesn’t currently have an electric scooter in its stable, Luke said the partnership could make a huge dent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="De5Yxu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trying to replicate Hero’s presence in India would be “moronic,” Gogoro’s CEO said&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ndATcG"&gt;“It has been a very, I would say, challenging, challenging endeavor for [Hero] because they’re missing the infrastructure part of the equation,” he said. “They don’t have a battery swapping infrastructure that has proven to be solid enough for India to to transform and electrify their nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZGutp"&gt;Partnering with Hero made more sense than trying to break into India solo, Luke said, because trying to replicate the dealerships and presence the Indian manufacturer has built out over decades would be “moronic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yRDfF"&gt;“I would never try replicate that. It would kill me. I would be too old by the time I’d get even near that,” he said. “We need to play to the strength of the partner locally and enable them through our technology to let them win and go faster.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lf79v"&gt;Gogoro has dabbled in other markets in the past, but pretty much only as a provider for scooter-sharing services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12358280/gogoro-electric-scooter-sharing-app-berlin-taiwan"&gt;like Coup in Germany and France&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership with Hero, then, represents a new way for Gogoro to pollenate the world with its electric scooter tech — something that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;been a goal since it came out of stealth mode at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHuCFK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching the most egregious scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiP7jjgMFJRfUbjrdRBS5eHQf_Y=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161392/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A one-man Bunco Squad is poking holes in Apple’s App Store image&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="qQn2RS"&gt;Recently, I reached out to the most profitable company in the world to ask a series of basic questions. I wanted to understand: how is a single man making the entire Apple App Store review team look silly? Particularly now that Apple’s in the fight of its life, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;in the courts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22378697/apple-witness-senate-judiciary-hearing-antitrust-app-stores"&gt;in Congress later today&lt;/a&gt;, to prove its App Store is a well-run system that keeps users safe instead of a monopoly that needs to be broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnxRWd"&gt;That man’s name is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt;, and over the past few months, he’s made a convincing case that Apple is either uninterested or incompetent at stopping multimillion-dollar scams in its own App Store. He’s repeatedly found scam apps that prey on ordinary iPhone and iPad owners by luring them into a “free trial” of an app with seemingly thousands of fake 5-star reviews, only to charge them outrageous sums of money for a recurring subscription that many don’t understand how to cancel. “It’s a situation that most communities are blind to because of how Apple is essentially brainwashing people into believing the App Store is a trusted place,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOIPmq"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack there: fake free trials, fake reviews, subscription awareness. We could write an entire story about each. Today, I’d like to focus on how one guy could find what Apple’s $64-billion-a-year App Store apparently cannot, because the answer is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYDL7A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Can it really be this easy?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zwzUSt"&gt;You simply look at the apps that are making the most money. Then, you find ones where the user reviews are suspicious and look for ridiculously high subscription prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHzVUl"&gt;That’s it. There’s no step four. Eleftheriou tells us this is how he started finding these scams, but you don’t need to be a coder to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJ0ZZh"&gt;Heck, let’s try it together right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mT5Gf8"&gt;While Apple doesn’t share “top grossing” charts for the App Store any more (that seems to have died with the introduction of iOS 11 in 2017), companies like SensorTower still publicly share that data. All you have to do is pick an app category — &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/business?date=2021-04-15"&gt;say, Business&lt;/a&gt; — and click through the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5ukZd"&gt;Here’s “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/appitate-llc/app/call-recorder-icall/1447098963/overview"&gt;Call Recorder iCall&lt;/a&gt;,” the #26 top-grossing app in the Business category on the day I checked. As you can see below, “Charlier Brown” says he’s 100 percent satisfied and there’s a 3-day free trial, so what do we have to lose other than... &lt;em&gt;$9.99 a week?&lt;/em&gt; Hooo boy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rESiNvMmQvBR9xF-Tv31PWBlrz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453912/icall_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Charlier Brown” thinks you’ll like this call recorder app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pdxBfX"&gt;Users of the app tend to complain they can’t figure out how to cancel that $520 a year  subscription — and that the app often stops recording after just a handful of seconds. Yet somehow it’s got a 4.5-star rating on the App Store. And fake reviews clearly have something to do with it. Here are a few &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/publisher/app/appName/1447098963/review-history?selected_tab=reviews"&gt;that app data firm SensorTower recently archived&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BVUdpL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No real downside&lt;/strong&gt; by Leena Hayes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2E8hgU"&gt;The app is free and is very versatile. Obviously if you are more into working out it may not be the best (there are high lv’s so it can be difficult) but for what it offers you it’s fantastic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89XJAI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best at home at I’ve found&lt;/strong&gt; by Darren Gorham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezVce8"&gt;Ive tried various at home apps to use in between the gym and none of them are as easy to use. The workouts are effective and I love the tracking it provides along with caloric counts and timing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xM0gc5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No equipment needed&lt;/strong&gt; by Rosalba Noble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J70tk8"&gt;If you want to feel better about yourself &amp;amp; not join a gym, highly recommend this app as it gets you motivated to bigger as in more reps - not weights. I think its great to use your own body weight to get that burning workout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nnHDKv"&gt;Call Recorder iCall is clearly not an exercise app, but that doesn’t seem to have stopped these “reviewers” from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw0eN9"&gt;Now, let’s try the #8 top-grossing app in the Utilities category: “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/us/tv-cast-co-ltd/app/roku-remote-control-roki/1481938145/"&gt;Roku Remote Control - Roki&lt;/a&gt;,” which seems a little suspicious when you consider that Roku gives away &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roku-official-remote-control/id482066631"&gt;its own official remote control app&lt;/a&gt; for free. Here are a few choice one-star reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RxbZZW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking my money&lt;/strong&gt; by 804user&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdhrE0"&gt;I paid for the $19.99, but I am still being charged each month and still have yet to hear back from any type of customer SERVICE....BEWARE!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7qpoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Didn’t work&lt;/strong&gt; by lawstudent1989&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHtwze"&gt;And now I can’t cancel my subscription in the app it and I’m worried it’s just a farce to get my credit card info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9bAAE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not impressed&lt;/strong&gt; by FallenWish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVIzy7"&gt;So originally I had this app on my android and it was free but now we have to pay for it?Like we don’t already dole out 300 dollars or more for the tvs   ‍♀️There is just no winning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="f0PrJV"&gt;And here’s the first screen you’ll see after downloading:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fndrSL7Q0saqUf7aNYqGgnEJFM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453914/roki_subscription.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Roku remote looks like such a good deal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TMkewI"&gt;How could an app like this possibly have a 4.5-star rating in the App Store? Well, it wouldn’t if you actually averaged out each written review: Apple’s “4.5” counts every disembodied rating where someone punched in a number of stars, even if that was just to dismiss an annoying pop-up so they could try the app. As Eleftheriou tells me (pointing to his tweet, which I’ve embedded below), Roki would have had a rating of just 1.7 stars if you only counted reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJSncF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Out of 15,000 ratings, only 338 reviews! And their average?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.7 stars&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ONE. POINT. SEVEN.&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1360146173340704775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14eOzT"&gt;Here’s the kicker: Eleftheriou called out this app’s behavior &lt;em&gt;two months ago&lt;/em&gt;, and yet &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1481938145?l=en"&gt;it still exists in the App Store today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear why, but it brings me to another important point. Even when people point out these shady apps, Apple doesn’t necessarily take action — and as Eleftheriou pointed out to me during our conversation, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has some direct experience there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3URwfR"&gt;On February 8th, we brought a bunch of these scams to Apple’s attention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;with this story&lt;/a&gt;, which prominently embedded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938981866860550"&gt;a tweet by Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; about another scammy app called “&lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/dragon-game-studio/app/star-gazer/1474038335/overview"&gt;Star Gazer+&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4j60ea"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4.6 stars, with over 80,000 ratings, and a glowing 5-star "featured" review: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Aup1ehYTdk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Aup1ehYTdk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938981866860550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qCB7ma"&gt;Apple didn’t remove that app for two whole months, and won’t tell us the reasons for the delay. On the record, Apple would only provide this statement for our story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y6rze1"&gt;“We designed and built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for our users, and are constantly improving our processes to reduce fraud, malware and spam. To provide our users with the best experience, we regularly reject and remove apps, as well as fraudulent ratings and reviews, resulting in millions of removals every year. We intend to keep at this important work to ensure users can confidently download the apps they love and developers continue to make the App Store a great business opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jxbpnQ"&gt;Star Gazer+ finally disappeared on April 8th, after Apple was approached by another journalist &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2021/04/07/apple-iphone-ipad-app-store-scam-warning-new-iphone-problem/?sh=7231e8a960aa"&gt;who publicly asked why it was taking so long&lt;/a&gt;. (It also happened to be the day Epic Games drew attention to some of these scams in a legal filing, though we’re not sure either is the true reason.) And while it appears that its publisher Dragon Game Studio has been booted off the App Store in the process, Apple appears to have overlooked its &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; publisher account &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/publisher/publisher/631073615"&gt;for co-founder Jonas Johnsson&lt;/a&gt;, whose current claim to fame — no joke — is a “Ghost Detector+” with a $5/week recurring subscription fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qam2H9"&gt;Johnsson’s also got &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/horoscope/id1273077875"&gt;an $8/week horoscope app&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m sorry, this juxtaposition of angry reviews and a 4.5 score makes me laugh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YALilJ9VUTMVQajkcbSkuvP9qKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22453915/Clipboard01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seems like a bit of a mismatch here, Apple?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVq2ga"&gt;While it’s impossible for us to tell how many of the horoscope app’s 32,000 star-only ratings are fake, Eleftheriou says Apple should have no problem with that. “When you consider refund request rates, app usage, and other associated info that only Apple has, you could imagine a totally revamped discovery system that does away with the current crude star-rating system that hasn’t seen any innovation since Bezos pioneered it 20 years ago,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99ZpZ8"&gt;During my hunt for scam apps, I also notice that some reviewers of these shady apps complain that developers are asking them for money a second time, even though they already purchased full premium access, and Eleftheriou says it sadly appears to be a theme: “A lot of scammers go and buy successful apps from people, and all they need to do is take that skeleton, make minor modifications and make a lot of money,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu8vQN"&gt;To get a sense of just how much money these scams are bilking out of people, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263766331494402"&gt;here are some comparisons&lt;/a&gt; Eleftheriou made when he spotted a VPN app scam last week, one that Apple was remarkably quick to shut down (after myself and a number of other journalists reached out to Apple about the painfully obvious scam):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOSyil"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To give you an idea, that’s more recurring revenue than apps like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Microsoft Word&lt;br&gt;- Microsoft OneDrive&lt;br&gt;- Google Drive&lt;br&gt;- Washington Post&lt;br&gt;- Fox News&lt;br&gt;- Reddit&lt;br&gt;- Bloomberg&lt;br&gt;- NBC Sports&lt;br&gt;- Grand Theft Auto&lt;br&gt;- NBA LIVE&lt;br&gt;- Monopoly&lt;br&gt;- DocuSign&lt;br&gt;- Udemy&lt;br&gt;- LastPass&lt;br&gt;- GoPro&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263766331494402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSbuHf"&gt;But it’s only “quick” if you ignore that Apple didn’t stop the scammers for six whole months, even though they caught the &lt;em&gt;exact same developer&lt;/em&gt; doing the &lt;em&gt;exact same thing &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263777865846787"&gt;months before&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="237PTA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It gets worse. This developer is a repeat offender inside Apple’s “walled garden”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had *another* VPN scam that netted them over half a MILLION dollars before it was shutdown early 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now knowing Apple’s lack of punishment they’re even more brazen &amp;amp; more profitable. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R99l9Rn21u"&gt;pic.twitter.com/R99l9Rn21u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382263777865846787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VznQX9"&gt;You would think Apple would keep these off the App Store, right? And if not then it would at least root them out, catch the scam artists, and keep them from doing it again. Yet that doesn’t seem to be happening. While Apple currently makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;an estimated $64 billion a year from its App Store&lt;/a&gt; and tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has computer automation, proprietary review tools, huge volumes of internal data, and a dedicated “Discovery Fraud team” of humans at its disposal, a single person on a laptop in his living room is finding egregious scams that Apple continues to host, and I was able to use his basic technique to do the same thing. As Apple faces down hearings in Congress and lawsuits in court, its argument that it needs to maintain total control over the iPhone app ecosystem to keep users safe doesn’t mesh with the obvious examples of grift that anyone can easily find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxDzim"&gt;Here’s another scam Eleftheriou spotted (I highly recommend this whole thread):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="75urnh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You think the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; is “a place you can trust”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Think again! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to spot a $5M/year scam, in 5 minutes flat: &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1381463196280610816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6rk0YT"&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cdx7sV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I don't know what's worse about this app:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- “Translated” fake reviews&lt;br&gt;- “Recommended by Apple” popups in Safari&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kq5lRrKCWc"&gt;https://t.co/Kq5lRrKCWc&lt;/a&gt; contact email&lt;br&gt;- Blank website, registered in India&lt;br&gt;- $9.99/week subscription&lt;br&gt;- Grossing $1M (!) a month&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is Apple even doing?? &lt;a href="https://t.co/5oUBCJ2GNh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5oUBCJ2GNh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1379682377304211457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s8pjCr"&gt;And another. (If you find some, too, Eleftheriou would love to hear from you at bunco.squad@hey.com.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zAHGv8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So once again, Apple took down another app I exposed but is cool with the developer running their other, even *more* profitable scam. I'm speechless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below you see "Live Wallpaper Z", allowed to keep stealing $40k/month from unsuspecting people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do I know?  &lt;a href="https://t.co/KkehMixic8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KkehMixic8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357446762949054464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ubGJ3M"&gt;Eleftheriou tells me that Apple has removed over 100 apps due to his reports — and if you’re wondering whether his online crusade is personal, the answer is most definitely yes. He began digging for scams after his own app FlickType, a keyboard for Apple Watch, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;was overtaken by scam apps that didn’t work and charged ludicrous fees&lt;/a&gt;, yet prospered due to fake reviews. What’s more, he claims Apple gave his competitors (and scammers) a leg up by refusing to initially approve his app — because Apple was hoping to acquire it from him at a cheap price instead. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he filed a lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt; for two years of lost revenue and other damages. So he’s absolutely got skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdQ4IV"&gt;But I don’t think that lessens the impact of his Twitter threads about where, precisely, Apple’s App Store is falling down on the job. The fake review situation seems bad. So do the difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. While I like to think most &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers will see the fine print and know how to cancel, and Apple’s been getting better about mandated warnings, the bewildered reviews on these apps are a sign that many iPhone and iPad users are still having trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mhph4"&gt;Eleftheriou suggests to me that the kind of users who might be most vulnerable to these scams are experiencing a kind of perfect storm: “They get virus pop-ups in Safari, they’re directed to the App Store and think the app is recommended by Apple, they download the app thinking it’ll help them, it’s got the perfect ratings, and they’re not savvy enough to know.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cs9uOD"&gt;He shares a chart with me (from &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures&lt;/a&gt;, see below) about how long it can take for vulnerable users to turn off recurring subscriptions: “Only half will have figured out how to cancel it two months later. The other half still hasn’t figured it out after 8 whole weekly billing cycles,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3JMtrtvtCzjrtE4NikKBOpM4qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454671/QTKjQiuW.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart by AppFigures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;“Only half will have figured out how to cancel it two months later.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYCDB0"&gt;Situations like these make it harder than ever for Apple to justify its constant rhetoric about how the App Store is safe, secure, and defended, or that it’s necessary for Apple to be solely in charge, something that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;already been in question&lt;/a&gt; for years due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;the company’s arbitrary enforcement of its rules&lt;/a&gt; and recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;App Store cash grabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQevDt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HZ4dh"&gt;And we’re starting to hear from Apple insiders, too, that the company’s claims about App Store security are overblown. Eric Friedman, the head of the company’s Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk (FEAR) team, will be testifying in next month’s Epic Games trial. In a recent deposition he spoke of the App Review team as “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight” and “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog.” His team reportedly believed App Review’s job was incentivized to get apps “through the pipe” and “move people through” like TSA employees. “App Reviewers typically review between 50 to 100 apps per day,” reads part of Epic Games’ filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61G2Bb"&gt;Other App Store executives deposed for the Epic Games trial admitted that they were aware of a number of the types of scams we’re discussing today, including ringtone apps that reportedly raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars a month despite users warning against them — &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.407.0.pdf"&gt;start at page 170 here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; for examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv1LNy"&gt;“Apple likes to tie the App Store together with the system level protections, and bundle them together as the reason why the distribution is secure, but really it’s the system-level protections that are doing all the work,” says Eleftheriou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slU8nz"&gt;Meanwhile, Apple former senior director of worldwide marketing (and noted tech analyst) Michael Gartenberg praised Eleftheriou’s recent efforts to highlight scams, suggesting that the Apple ecosystem is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gartenberg/status/1383122033588985856"&gt;“breaking at the seams.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="owr4Jb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I believe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@keleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; has brought an important issue about the App Store to a mainstream audience. I hope Apple gets its act together soon. The ecosystem that is often praised is breaking at the seams IMHO&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Gartenberg (@Gartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gartenberg/status/1383122033588985856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gloOn0"&gt;But the thing I’m stuck on is how the most profitable company in the world, a company that has long justified a 30-percent cut of the App Store’s billions because of its App Review efforts, a company with multiple enforcement teams and access to internal data, isn’t doing the simple task of auditing the App Store’s top-grossing apps for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGV82N"&gt;It’s not a novel idea: &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/12/03/barnard-game-app-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;’s John Gruber suggested it in December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and again &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1169078580703375361"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and again &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/09/widgetsmith_bunco_squad"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They don’t have to look through them all. Even if that were possible it’d be stupid. All they have to do is police the most popular ones. If they simply looked at the top charts and scanned for scams they’d find most of them.&lt;/p&gt;— John Gruber (@gruber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1310634858499190792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mRxkda"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapp-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22385859%2Fapple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;though Apple claims&lt;/a&gt; “the apps we offer are held to the highest standards for privacy, security, and content,” and that “moderators review worldwide App Store charts for quality and accuracy” every single day, it doesn’t seem to have taken this simple step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMLMpL"&gt;Apple would not tell me why one man is continuing to find egregious apps that Apple’s fraud and app review teams are missing, or whether it goes back to inspect the App Store’s most lucrative apps for fraud. The company would not say how it protects customers against fake reviews, or whether any customers that fell for these scams will get refunds, or how it plans to combat scams in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGefny"&gt;Apple did say generically that it does offer &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084"&gt;the ability to &lt;em&gt;request&lt;/em&gt; refunds&lt;/a&gt;; that it does re-review apps against its App Store guidelines; and that it has improved its subscription processes both by 1) requiring app developers to clearly display what customers are getting into and how to cancel, and 2) prompting users to “manage” their subscription at the time they delete an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2NWfIg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I repeat my request from last year: the App Store needs a bunco squad — a team that hunts for and is empowered to take action against scammy apps. And ban repeat offenders. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nGpZeALUdw"&gt;https://t.co/nGpZeALUdw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Gruber (@gruber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1169078580703375361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 4, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYUNiw"&gt;By the way: you know that app that John Gruber helped draw attention to in 2019, the one that reportedly charged $10 every week for wallpaper you could find free online? &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/background-beautiful-photos/id1171036231"&gt;It’s still on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Never got removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Rh0Nwo"&gt;It currently has a 4.1 rating, despite countless negative reviews, and &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/US/tron-apps-inc/app/background-beautiful-photos/1171036231/overview"&gt;SensorTower estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app still makes its developer $10,000 a month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC downplays leaked Vive Air headset, says it’s just a concept</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYsyTF4bvv-TpiG6M1ysDzRnYdI=/128x0:2432x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161345/309526_01_vive_air_b_1500x2500.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked images appeared to show a new fitness-focused VR headset from HTC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9Vi1z"&gt;HTC has downplayed leaked images that appeared to show a new fitness-focused VR headset built by the firm. Pictures and details of the HTC Vive Air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393527/htc-vive-air-fitness-focused-headset-leaks-images#comments"&gt;leaked online&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week on a design award website but HTC now says the headset is “only a concept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlFm5a"&gt;“It’s exciting to see our concept piece, the VIVE Air VR headset, win an iF Design Award,” the company said in a statement given to &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/htc-vive-air-concept/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “While this is only a concept, the design language has elements and inspirations you’ll see elsewhere in our products. We’re not ones to rest on our laurels, so although it’s great to win this award, we have business to attend to — hopefully we’ll see you on 11/12 May at ViveCon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R12T6vRvtAHyl17Zgn7nVAQNBMc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456641/htc_vive_air_leak_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HTC Vive Air claimed to be made from breathable knitted fabrics. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PuNMZE"&gt;This statement doesn’t &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; rule out that some similar product is in the works from HTC, but the company is definitely keeping things carefully ambiguous. It has been teasing a &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/htc-vive-headset-2021/"&gt;new headset reveal&lt;/a&gt; at ViveCon next month, but the images and hints we’ve seen so far suggest an enterprise-focused model rather than a fitness device for general consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMEBdt"&gt;That’s a shame, as VR fitness is having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;something of a moment&lt;/a&gt;, and the idea of a specially-designed, lightweight and washable headset is an appealing idea. With HTC’s consumer business in the doldrums, though, it’s perhaps not a sensible target for the company right now. We’ll just have to wait and see what the firm has in store at ViveCon in May.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>B&amp;W’s first true wireless headphones have a workaround for in-flight entertainment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaxp5DWfrH0Alwu6BWaR1raEyfM=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161331/High__PI7_Buds_Top_Rotation___White_A_3x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PI7 true wireless headphones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bowers and Wilkins&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zsAeO4"&gt;Bowers and Wilkins’ debut pair of noise cancelling true wireless earbuds, the PI7, fix one of the key annoyances with the form-factor — it’s usable with in-flight entertainment systems because the case doubles as an audio transmitter. Plug the case into an audio source using an included 3.5mm to USB-C cable and it will retransmit the audio wirelessly to the earbuds. Alongside it, Bowers and Wilkins has also announced the cheaper PI5 true wireless headphones, which also offer noise-cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnepXh"&gt;Bowers and Wilkins claims the PI7’s transmitting case is an industry first, and it’s certainly the first time we’ve heard of such a feature. In contrast, trying to use other popular true wireless earbuds like the AirPods Pro with a plane’s built-in entertainment system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;requires a third-party dongle&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, the PI7’s transmitting case should also work with any other non-Bluetooth devices you own, like an old iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cLqruF0ZH3_gnLynmjgySjoaTLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459089/Low__PI5_Buds_Top_Rotation___Charcoal7_3x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bowers and Wilkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PI5 true wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xySwL8uW-F1o16NoZatVEpRveuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459092/Low__PI7_Case_45___White_A_3x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bowers and Wilkins&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PI7 headphones in their charging case, which doubles as a wireless transmitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lD4XNX"&gt;Beyond the PI7’s fancy case, it offers a fairly standard set of features for a pair of true wireless headphones. The earbuds are noise cancelling, and are equipped with six microphones in total for calls or using voice assistants. It uses the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17660460/aptx-adaptive-qualcomm-audio-compression-algorithm-android-pie-ifa-2018"&gt;AptX Adaptive standard&lt;/a&gt;, which should allow it to dynamically compress audio to maintain a stable connection, and its case can be charged wirelessly. The earbuds themselves have a modest battery life of 4 hours (compared to 4.5 for the AirPods Pro), while the case offers 16 hours more. The buds have an IP54 dust and water resistance rating, so they should survive light splashes and limited amounts of dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4D6TOt"&gt;The cheaper PI5 earbuds also offer noise cancellation and come with a case that can be charged wirelessly, but they only have four microphones total. There’s also no mention of AptX Adaptive —  just regular AptX — and there’s no sign of the PI7’s audio retransmission case. Battery life for the PI5 appears to be slightly better than the more expensive PI7 however, with the earbuds offering 4.5 hours of playback on a single charge. The case offers 20 hours more. The PI5 also have a dust and water resistance rating of IP54.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxJ7Ei"&gt;Both earbuds are available starting today. The PI7 cost $399 / £349 / €399, while the PI5 cost $249 / £199 / €249.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is rolling out a new tool to automatically filter out abusive DMs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WB7kRqVRBrqTKRAxFBIvPsWoeEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161216/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQIZBl"&gt;Instagram announced a new tool today that will allow users to automatically filter out direct message requests containing offensive words, phrases, and emojis. The tool is targeted at celebrities and public figures who receive a large number of unwanted, harmful DMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VujYE"&gt;The update builds on Instagram’s work to combat hate speech on the platform. In February, the company said it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276491/instagram-direct-message-hate-speech-account-disabled-policy"&gt;disabling the accounts of users who sent multiple harassing messages&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the company expanded its offensive comments filter to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308012/instagram-offensive-comment-filtering"&gt;automatically block comments that attack a person’s appearance or character&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdRvcq"&gt;The message requests filter can be toggled on or off in a new section of the app called “hidden words.” When it’s on, offensive messages will be pushed to a separate folder. DMs in this folder are concealed, allowing users to browse messages without needing to read what they say. If a user taps into a message, they can read, delete, or report it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laMCw2"&gt;The company says it worked with “leading anti-discrimination and anti-bullying organizations” to come up with a preset list of offensive phrases. Users can also customize their own list based on what they don’t want to see.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqToNx"&gt;Instagram said the new feature will be rolling out to “several countries” in the coming weeks, though it did not specify which countries those are. The company plans to expand to more countries in the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4O2nd"&gt;As part of the announcement today, Instagram also said it is rolling out a tool to allow people to preemptively block new accounts from harassers. Now, when a user blocks someone in the app, they’ll have the option of blocking any new accounts that person creates. The company declined to specify how it does this, saying only that it uses a “variety of signals” to detect new accounts from those same users. The feature will be pushed out globally in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrNRMu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM9SSk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech announces cheaper Magic Keyboard alternative for new iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIhR5Hfs7KeT1zVyy3kYGUa0DJI=/0x1:1497x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69161192/lct.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efHctY"&gt;Apple just announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered update to the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and Logitech has followed up with a new keyboard and trackpad accessory for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models. The Combo Touch is a case with a Microsoft Surface-style kickstand and a detachable backlit keyboard with a trackpad. It connects over the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSDFxZ"&gt;Logitech already released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"&gt;similar Combo Touch keyboard for 10.2-inch and 10.5-inch iPads&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a related &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Ffolio-touch.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Folio Touch&lt;/a&gt; for the 11-inch iPad Pro and 10.9-inch iPad Air. The Folio Touch’s keyboard isn’t detachable and its trackpad is a little smaller than the new Combo Touch, but otherwise it’s a comparable product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKbpM07pVTlgcVfm02zqpYAPk0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459035/lct2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d5nEia"&gt;This is the first time Logitech has offered a keyboard/trackpad option for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, however, and it’s significantly cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s own Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. The 11-inch model is $199.99 and the 12.9-inch model is $229.99 versus the $299 and $349 that Apple charges, meaning you could save about $100 or more on the sticker prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX4sJC"&gt;You might actually prefer Logitech’s design, as well. It’s not as sleek as the Magic Keyboard, but the case will offer better protection for the iPad, the detachability and kickstand offers an extra degree of versatility, and the keyboard has a useful function row. The 11-inch model is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fcombo-touch-ipad.920-010095.html%3Fcrid%3D1762%23buy-combo-touch-ipad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395219%2Flogitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to pre-order now&lt;/a&gt;, while the 12.9-inch version is listed as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your AirTag can’t say horseshit but it can say shit horse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOzVugXqLpd3tX4pcM19AHxVNfg=/126x0:683x371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160283/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_3.51.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hs4Xss"&gt;After what feels like ages of rumors, speculation, and worry that I was getting way too obsessed with a Bluetooth item tracker that seemed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/2/17924312/tile-mate-pro-premium-subscription-launch-battery-range-price"&gt;similar to ones&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt; other companies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;AirTags are finally here&lt;/a&gt;. But before you preorder the Mentos-esque pucks, there’s something you should be aware of: if you want to engrave your AirTags, you can’t combine a horse and poop emoji in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20rRSu"&gt;That’s right, the emoji version of “horseshit” is a no-go when getting an engraving for Apple’s newest product. Here’s what happens when you try to make that your engraving of choice:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NutL9CXqgO33Uqx7XCe7_CRxh-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458423/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_4.48.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says no to “horseshit” in emoji form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QMOxcH"&gt;Curiously, poop and then horse (“shit horse”) is totally fine, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1Uymr65Ow6aJYNmaOZraMUcD6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458224/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_3.20.01_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has no problem with “shit horse”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JxnslX"&gt;Fictional horse excrement is fair game too. Despite being a horn away from being exactly the same emoji, “unicorn shit” works fine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6JUfeJdQV-RlelRmLeRZXEqBfg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458484/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_5.27.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is more forgiving of fictional horses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOJ6R"&gt;As do emoji representations I tried for “snake shit,” “monkey shit,” “chicken shit,” and even “shit bird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="93hkSZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10457217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gPs9"&gt;Similar limitations apply to actual offensive words as well. Apple gives you &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough letters for some creative diction, but catches some of the obvious offenders. “SUCK,” “NSFW,” and “BUTT” are still on the table though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjKJne"&gt;This is all very silly on some level, but consistent with the conservative California Dad lens through which Apple seems to make most of its product decisions. The same emoji restrictions are present on AirPods and iPad engravings, for example. Though on those devices, “horseshit” does seem to work — so if you really want to brand your AirPods case that way, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mabrO7"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if these limitations are deliberate or a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who knew Tim Apple was a professional thief?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCEFnGDhoGu_YcMPvSjC4NS90rs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160236/tim_cook_spy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ca3vDl"&gt;Tim Cook, the mild-mannered Apple CEO, probably didn’t have to lift more than a finger to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394227/apple-ipad-pro-2021-how-where-to-buy-preorder-link"&gt;a new line of iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; with the company’s Arm-based M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlFWXE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254958/tim-cook-apple-trump-username-changed-twitter-name-potus-president"&gt;Tim Apple&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand? He’s the kind of daring superspy who can pull off a high-security heist, slicing through plate glass, rappelling down buildings, and dodging lasers, all with a trusty grappling hook at his side — as you’ll see in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYlMcEJK9MWmfi8-NurEkdWKq_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458419/tim_apple_cook_mission_impossible_4.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0cOS2X"&gt;Also, he’s apparently able to &lt;em&gt;unsocket&lt;/em&gt; a soldered-down chip, perhaps the most impressive trick of all — except perhaps for the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;where he gave Donald Trump a “new” factory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241646/apple-tim-cook-gave-the-first-mac-pro-to-trump"&gt;the “first” Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; off its assembly line. Not bad for a 60-year-old, even one who’s in charge of the most profitable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3KzH0"&gt;I sure hope he’s ready for the memes! Here’s one single GIF with everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uCtRQA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZq8LD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mmP1t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
