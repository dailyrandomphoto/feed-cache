    <title>I hate the new Windows 11 taskbar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qmi-N0_jDiEJBYk0oDx7FMgkt60=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855647/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7AvFvp"&gt;Microsoft promotes itself as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;productivity company, but the new Windows 11 taskbar removes key functionality and makes me less productive as a result. Missing features include power user elements like displaying the time and date on multiple monitors, or simple things like having small icons and being able to move the taskbar around. There’s so much missing here that I’m stunned Microsoft is shipping a new OS that takes the Windows taskbar back decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jsj1Ga"&gt;While this missing functionality initially seemed like bugs or unfinished code, it’s clear Microsoft now intends to ship the taskbar like this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;. I personally use three monitors on my PC, and if I’m using a fullscreen app or a game on my primary one, I can’t see the date or time on my other monitors. This sounds like a small issue, but it’s glanceable information I look at multiple times a day and rely on. I simply don’t understand why Microsoft would remove this in the name of simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paxSPz"&gt;Another big missing feature is being able to drag and drop files onto taskbar apps. I commonly drag images from File Explorer onto the Adobe Photoshop icon on my taskbar, where it will bring the app into focus and open the file. This no longer works, and you’re presented with a giant red cross instead. This is basic functionality that has existed in Windows for years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TTISQ1bKQXvL6RmPDSHVmErZV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849280/qz7kU7v.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No more dragging and dropping on the taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yTQqBe"&gt;Elsewhere, the taskbar has been overhauled to remove a lot of the customization Windows users are used to. You can’t enable small icons anymore or ungroup icons. You can’t even move the taskbar to the top or sides of your screen, or adjust its height. Many users are also missing the Task Manager not being part of the taskbar context menu, or the many other cascade and windowing options that were previously there. Instead, the taskbar context menu has been reduced to a single taskbar settings option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orZGZr"&gt;The system tray is also worse in Windows 11 compared to Windows 10. You can’t easily hide system icons, and the whole area feels a little too simplified for my liking. The modernization of Windows 11 is great, but the taskbar really lets the OS down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWWpi0"&gt;I’ve been testing Windows 11 since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"&gt;initial preview release in June&lt;/a&gt;, and I honestly expected the taskbar to improve in time for release. After every preview release, I boot into Windows 11 expecting to see taskbar improvements, only to switch back to Windows 10 after a few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiwdV9fTcEv9_sHGiUzYUSKhsp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849276/YKc8oDJ.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is how the taskbar appears on multiple monitors in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wonAMG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Windows 11 will be the first version of Windows I won’t be upgrading to on my main PC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JC5Kxs"&gt;Because of this taskbar, Windows 11 will be the first version of Windows I won’t be upgrading to on my main PC. I’ve lived through Windows Vista and Windows 8, but even then, Microsoft at least allowed people to re-enable the interface elements they had grown used to. In Windows 11 you’ll need to apply registry hacks or use third-party programs to get the taskbar you’re used to, and those workarounds could break after any OS update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL4A8T"&gt;I’m not the only person complaining about the taskbar, in fact there have been countless feedback threads in Microsoft’s official Windows Feedback Hub in recent months that highlight these issues. Microsoft tells me it’s listening to user feedback, but it clearly hasn’t acted on most of it in time for release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEBbgflYMNnExQ5EO5GGOPCNq2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849265/OMNZhiS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 taskbar has a really basic context menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vmIFTG"&gt;“Windows 11 was built on the design principles of making Windows effortless, calmer, and more personal, while still feeling familiar,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Taskbar, like many other parts of Windows 11, was redesigned from the ground up guided by these principles. As with every experience in Windows 11, we’re constantly listening and learning, and welcome customer feedback that helps shape Windows. Windows 11 will continue to evolve over time; if we learn from user experience that there are ways to make improvements, we will do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUXRdz"&gt;I still haven’t heard a good explanation for this basic loss of functionality, but I suspect most of the features are missing because Microsoft rebuilt the taskbar for Windows 10X. Windows 10X was originally going to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;run on dual-screen devices&lt;/a&gt;, before Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;reworked it for laptops&lt;/a&gt; and then moved to Windows 11 instead. Microsoft simplified the taskbar in Windows 10X greatly, and many other parts of the OS. That hasn’t translated well back to desktop PCs, or for power users of Windows that rely on the taskbar daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwiwho"&gt;I’m hopeful that Microsoft will once again prove that it listens to its Windows users, but until then I’m staying clear of Windows 11 for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 may finally get features Android has had for years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJ80i-6mzVET3bBSxNSOoqLHlxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855600/vpavic_4243_20201017_0077.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APrmyo"&gt;It’s new iPhone day. And as with any new smartphone announcement these days, we have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;fairly decent idea of what to expect&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks and rumors are more accurate than ever, and though there’s always the potential of a big surprise, the most likely scenario is the iPhone 13 will be what we think it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXjXsF"&gt;Just because the rumors are clear doesn’t mean they’re not exciting, though. This year, the iPhone 13 (we assume that’s the name) will have some new technology in the same design. New designs tend to drive big upgrade cycles, but it’s the second year of the design that usually has the most interesting refinements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQuJJ"&gt;We can list them out fairly quickly. There should be four iterations again: A Mini, a regular, a Pro, and a Pro Max. The higher-end iPhones should have an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display, a low-power kind of OLED screen that makes it easier to have a variable refresh rate. The processors will be faster. The MagSafe charging system will be tweaked. There may be new storage options. The camera will be better, with improvements specifically in HDR and Portrait Mode video —- plus astrophotography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgAmZ3"&gt;All those specs will translate into some newer, nicer experiences. There’s one in particular I want to focus on: the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiwNKM"&gt;The LTPO display should mean that the iPhone can finally have an always-on lock screen. It should also finally enable smoother transitions as the screen ratchets from some tiny number of Hz to some large number like 120Hz instead of being locked at 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlObj2"&gt;Notice the “finallys” in that last paragraph. They’re there because variable refresh rates and always-on screens have been available on Android phones since... forever. In fact, if you run down the rumored features of the new iPhones, many of them appeared first on Android. In addition to high refresh rate screens there’s better quality wide-angle cameras, huge storage, portrait mode video, and astrophotography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZVR57R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Apple’s iPhone 13 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"},{"title":"iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3X0Ms9"&gt;Though the specs may be copied, the question comes back to the “experience.”. The cliche with Apple is that it rarely does something first, but instead comes in later with refinements and does it &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;. That cliche exists because it’s often right. You may have been able to turn on portrait mode for video on a Samsung phone since 2019, but believe me, you wouldn’t want to use it for anything important, because it’s bad. Apple’s, hopefully, will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8kodL"&gt;That narrative isn’t always correct, though. In some cases, it just papers over Apple just being straight up late to including a piece of technology. I am open to being wrong, but I hesitate to believe that it’s possible to make an always-on lock screen experience so insanely great that that every one before feels broken. It’s a lock screen you can glance at! There’s only so much to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKlarI"&gt;An always-on lock screen is also super useful! Being able to quickly see the time, date, and some notification icons is the sort of low-pressure ambient information a phone should be able to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CmqUr"&gt;Variable refresh rates are a little less useful, but so much nicer. They can preserve battery life by slowing down refresh rates. They can match the screen’s refresh rate to the content (eg. in a movie or a game). And they can make animations and scrolling look so much smoother. And yet, the only notable Apple devices to feature a high refresh rate are its high-end iPads. Meanwhile, every high-end Android phone and many mid-rangers have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDPDDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does Apple feel competitive pressure to include small, nice-to-have features?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOAVkN"&gt;I’m honestly a little baffled as to why it’s taken Apple this long to make such obviously nice features. One possible explanation — and maybe the most likely — is simply that Apple has felt no competitive pressure to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSKNkN"&gt;On Android, there are so many phones to choose from that the need to differentiate is urgently and keenly felt by every manufacturer. So a feature as minor as an always-on display could make the difference in somebody’s purchasing decision. But I struggle to imagine the person that would choose an Android phone over an iPhone simply because they like glancing down at the time on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4sDXo"&gt;So: why launch a variable refresh rate screen now? It’s gotten to the point where it’s a little embarrassing — many reviews of the iPhone 12 models pointed out this missing spec. And though iOS does still look smooth and feel fast at 60Hz, going to 120Hz has been Android’s brute force way of catching up in those departments. Switching iOS up to 120Hz could push Apple ahead again. So there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some competitive pressure, it just takes a bit longer to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWjTGE"&gt;I also suspect that Apple was simply waiting for component prices to come down and manufacturing yields to go up. The scale at which Apple needs to make phones makes both a requirement. But I feel like if Apple felt a little more competitive pressure, it could have pushed more aggressively to solve those problems sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HkL1bU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android vs Android is a war of tiny differences. iPhone vs Android is something else entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI9kyI"&gt;The point here is that there are lots of little features that iPhone users are missing out on simply because they’re not compelling enough on their own to convince people to switch. Under-screen fingerprint sensors on Android phones have gone from mediocre to great in just a few short years. Telephoto lenses are folded into periscopes that run along the lengths of the phone for even longer zooms. Screens are interrupted by only tiny little punch holes for selfie cameras (or, in some cases, not interrupted at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8cgbX"&gt;These are all niceties that aren’t a huge loss if you’re an iPhone user — well worth the tradeoff for the ecosystem, hardware quality, and performance you get with the average iPhone. They come first to Android because the pressure to compete against other Android makes is so intense that any little advantage matters. If there are two new phones on the store shelf that are very nearly the same but one has an always-on screen, well, that’s the one you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABsfZ0"&gt;iOS and Android are not at all the same, though. So when it comes to bringing these smaller hardware features to the iPhone, I can’t help but think that the competitive pressure Apple feels most urgently isn’t the smartphones you see on the store shelf. It’s the iPhone you’ve got in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s ‘California Streaming’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wmcn9R71G0w51UORmARF8IoVqBI=/184x0:1141x638/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855414/Screenshot_2021_09_10_7.38.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m80YT8"&gt;It’s September, which means iPhone season is just nearly here. The rumor mill has been spinning about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;highly anticipated iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, a third generation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and the potential for new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;. A new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;bezel-less iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; is also a possibility, as is the official release of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HiZ05"&gt;Since Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;sent out the invite&lt;/a&gt; for its “California Streaming” event, we’ve been able to take guesses at what hidden meanings there might be to decipher from the night sky and the illuminated Apple logo, but just when does it actually get underway and where?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MHCz0z"&gt;What time does the iPhone 13 event start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6Hw1Q3"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event will go live at 10AM PT / 1PM ET today, Tuesday, September 14th. Like all Apple keynotes since the beginning of the pandemic, it will likely amount to a lengthy infomercial recorded and streamed from the Apple Park campus, with everyone from Tim Cook on down presenting. We expect the recording to become available shortly after its debut, too, in the event you miss out on the prerecorded livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UFZ2Pg"&gt;Where can I watch the Apple event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0CHXFL"&gt;Apple is hosting the stream &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22663255%2Fapple-event-iphone-13-live-stream-watch-start-time" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;, per usual, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvGOlAkLSLw"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve embedded the YouTube video above, so you can set a reminder or watch live from this very post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGebcM"&gt;Also, be sure to keep tabs on our live blog if you can’t watch the video while at work or if you prefer to follow along with our editors as announcements are made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s $5,999 EOS R3 focuses by tracking your eye</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_m8Ey3eFpWJBAj0xucJSJtt-hI=/0x5:1750x1172/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855323/HR_EOS_R3_4_CL.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2y8qO6"&gt;Canon confirmed plans for its highest-end mirrorless camera yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383187/canon-eos-r3-mirrorless-camera-development-announced"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt;, but that was just a notice of development — now the company is ready to announce its specs in full. As expected, the EOS R3 will sit right at the top of the company’s still fairly new EOS R range of full-frame mirrorless cameras, above last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;R5 and R6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NxcnO"&gt;The 24-megapixel stacked BSI sensor is lower resolution than the 45-megapixel R5’s, but the R3 is all about high speed, fast AF performance, and low light capability. Canon says it can shoot at up to 30fps with the electronic shutter and 12fps with the mechanical shutter, and the maximum native ISO is 102,400. As for video, the R3 can shoot 6K at 60fps and uncropped 10-bit 4K at 120fps in the Canon Log 3 profile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUxDi_c_ju3WaVmt2ieAFGjdDrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849228/HR_EOS_R3_7_CL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xUJMZp"&gt;The R3 makes use of deep learning technology to improve eye and body detection and autofocus, according to Canon, and photographers can select an initial AF point with eye tracking just by looking at an area of the 5.76-million-dot electronic viewfinder. The R3 has 1,053 AF points in total, though Canon isn’t saying quite how granular the eye-input system gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8knyi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVstWLb-flM"&gt;YouTube’s CVP channel&lt;/a&gt; provides a good demonstration of the new eye controlled AF point selection, noting that it uses low-powered IR LEDs inside the viewfinder to scan where the eyes are looking. The channel calls the tech “hit and miss” for different users, but says it makes focusing “pretty simple” when it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Sxw8xp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVstWLb-flM?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=365&amp;amp;start=365" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNMrBl"&gt;As previously revealed, the R3 looks quite similar to the EOS-1D X Mark III, which essentially occupies the same place in Canon’s DSLR lineup. It uses a one-piece magnesium alloy design with a built-in vertical grip, and Canon says it has equivalent weather and dust resistance to the EOS-1D DSLRs. The body has wired LAN, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB-C built-in, as well as one CFexpress card slot and one UHS-II SD card slot. There’s also a vari-angle 3.2-inch LCD screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jvovvjdb0-kEOnhcQlbky0Ir9Ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849229/HR_EOS_R3_9_CL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7oHGEo"&gt;The EOS R3 will be available in November for $5,999,99. Canon is also introducing two new relatively affordable lenses for the EOS R system: a $299.99 16mm f/2.8 compact ultrawide prime and a $649.99 100-400mm f/5.6-8 telephoto zoom. Both of those will go on sale at some point next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkBPAO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 14th, 6:20AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added video demonstration of eye controlled AF point selection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon One’s palm-scanning tech makes first move into entertainment venues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6YVOIPCGcxtUNuVeD_T5pL613k=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855299/amazon_one_palm_scan_stadium.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NH6rb1"&gt;Amazon’s palm-scanning technology, Amazon One, has always been about more than just fast payments. Really, it’s about Amazon controlling and verifying identities, with the company hoping to deploy its service in public spaces like offices and stadiums. Today, Amazon announced the tech’s &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-one-expands-beyond-retail-with-first-third-party-customer-ticketing-company-axs"&gt;first launch in an entertainment venue&lt;/a&gt; as part of a partnership with ticketing firm AXS. Amazon One will be available to validate entry into Colorado’s famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre, an open-air venue built into a rocky outcrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir05XX"&gt;It’s the first time the technology has been deployed outside Amazon and Whole Food stores, and Amazon says it expects the tech will be added “to more AXS ticketed venues in the future.” People can enroll into the scheme at dedicated stations in the Red Rocks venue, with these booths analyzing the unique patterns of veins and lines in their palms to register and then later verify identities. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Umphreys McGee In Concert At Red Rocks Amphitheatre" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3DaeK74GOItocA9czZ5vXvXCsec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849247/1233572032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre has been home to many notable events and concerts. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rzoLrj"&gt;Amazon is trying to make the case that this technology is more convenient than regular contactless cards and QR codes, but it’s not that convincing. It’s true that you can’t &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; your palm in a way you might lose a physical ticket, but most tickets are available on our phones these days, which we tend to have with us all the time. Numerous privacy experts, meanwhile, have expressed skepticism about Amazon’s ambitions here. The company is not likely to make money from Amazon One, so instead it must be interested in the data it can collect. If Amazon One becomes standard use in physical stores and venues, then the company will get better insight into customers shopping habits and hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEWzkX"&gt;Right now, though, there doesn’t seem to be a huge amount of momentum behind the technology. It’s been out a year and Amazon says that “tens of thousands of customers have signed up and used the service to enter and pay at participating Amazon stores” only. The company is also trying to encourage sign-ups by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607218/amazon-one-palm-print-technology-10-dollar-promo"&gt;offering $10 for your palm print&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest monitor has a pop-up webcam with Windows Hello support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Q77jZ55W1dKr0YEdVSiwbw_gco=/1x0:1335x889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855297/S40VA_3_274023_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Hello support lets you log in to Windows with just your face.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Msww1G"&gt;Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsungs-first-webcam-monitor-hybrid-workers-available-for-purchase-now/"&gt;Webcam Monitor S4&lt;/a&gt; comes with all the work-from-home accessories you could need built right in. It’s got 2W stereo speakers for listening to colleagues, an HD webcam so they can see you, a microphone so they can hear you, and a USB hub to cut down on the amount of ports needed on a laptop or desktop. The monitor is available now, &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsungs-first-webcam-monitor-hybrid-workers-available-for-purchase-now/"&gt;Samsung says&lt;/a&gt;, and costs $319.99 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pR1hqv"&gt;The 24-inch, 1080p monitor’s built-in webcam is neatly integrated, with a pop-up design that keeps things looking tidy when you’re not on video calls. As a bonus, the design doubles as a privacy shutter for the webcam to help prevent accidental (or malicious) appearances on camera. It’s not automated like on many phones. Instead, the webcam is revealed by “pushing it down into the monitor to make it spring up,” Samsung says. The webcam is Windows Hello certified, meaning it can scan faces to allow quick logins to apps, websites, and Windows itself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p0NJ_wOjruSdHWlW5nhlDIu2ItI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849236/S24A40_003_Front_Black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam hides away when not in use. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9CDDIx"&gt;Rounding out the specs is a stand that’s height-adjustable, and which can be tilted, swivelled, and pivoted. The monitor is also VESA compatible to let it work with monitor arms or other stands. Ports include HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2, and its refresh rate tops out at 75Hz. As well as the US, the Webcam Monitor S4 is also releasing in Europe, South Korea, and South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is once more accepting requests for verification </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/US853X9KvYziL1fTWeija3TJnGw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855269/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nL6qXJ"&gt;Kick the football, Charlie Brown! You’ll &lt;a href="https://peanuts.fandom.com/wiki/Football_gag"&gt;definitely get it this time&lt;/a&gt;! And while you’re at it, why not apply to be verified on Twitter? There’s no way that can go wrong either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gza9nw"&gt;The news: after temporarily halting new applications for its revamped verification process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623714/twitter-verification-program-pause-fake-accounts-review"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1437533358746218496"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s “back to rolling out access to request a blue badge.” The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1436435172912676865"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it put a pause on new applications in order to improve “the application flow and review process.” That may have something to do with the fake accounts that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;accidentally verified&lt;/a&gt; in July, but maybe Twitter has now learned from its mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3kgWVE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re back to rolling out access to request a blue badge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re planning to apply and don’t yet have access, keep checking your account settings. Thanks for sticking with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Verified (@verified) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1437533358746218496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8FvItF"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;relaunched&lt;/a&gt; its perennially troubled verification program in May this year, after it was put on ice in 2017. Twitter’s criteria for verification is that an account must be “&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;authentic, notable, and active&lt;/a&gt;,” but the public perception of verification has always been a little more ambiguous, stirring up controversy around the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qry9u"&gt;For a start, there are numerous cases of genuinely notable and influential figures going unverified, while podunk journalists like myself can saunter up to the verification table and grab a badge no questions. Some users, meanwhile, see verification mostly as a prestige item, indicating that verified individuals are somehow better than the mass of gelatinous pond scum that constitutes the &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;verified (I’m not saying that’s wrong, exactly) and so want to be verified just for the sake of it. Others see it as a mark of reliability, rather than simply notoriety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnnnO8"&gt;Trying to keep everyone happy has been difficult for Twitter, but its stop-start, uncoordinated approach to the whole business is hardly helping. For example, even though Twitter &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; users can apply for verification again, its FAQ page still &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;clearly states&lt;/a&gt; “There is no way to apply for verification today” (and seems not to have been updated since the beginning of the year). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kye7me"&gt;Anyway, maybe this time Twitter will sort out this mess for real. And maybe Charlie Brown will finally kick that football. Stranger things have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google found guilty of restricting Android forks in South Korea, fined $177 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/otBykqjvq2O1r-vdtRFyZAXsq3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855227/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7RlGSS"&gt;Google has been fined 207.4 billion won (around $177 million) in South Korea for abusing its dominant market position to stop device manufacturers from using modified versions of Android, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/south-korea-fines-google-for-abusing-smartphone-dominance?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) is taking issue with the anti-fragmentation agreements (AFA) Google has manufacturers like Samsung sign, which prevents it from making changes to the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9ohw8"&gt;The ruling prohibits Google from forcing manufacturers to sign these AFAs, and will also require it to modify existing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz1CZQ"&gt;The regulator is concerned that restricting these forks to the OS has prevented the emergence of viable competitors to Android from the likes of Amazon and Alibaba. Android is currently the world’s most popular mobile operating system, and is installed on over 80 percent of smartphones globally. Although the core of Android is open-source, manufacturers have to sign an AFA to get benefits like early access to the operating system as well as access to the Google Play Store, an essential part of the Android experience for most smartphone users, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/south-korea-antitrust-regulator-fines-google-177-million.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ypIHS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google intends to appeal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zjYeG7"&gt;“The Korea Fair Trade Commission’s decision is meaningful in a way that it provides an opportunity to restore future competitive pressure in the mobile OS and app market markets,” said KFTC chairperson Joh Sung-wook in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorean-antitrust-agency-fines-google-177-mln-abusing-market-dominance-2021-09-14/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The fine could be the ninth largest the regulator has ever issued, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdVW0o"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson from Google &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/south-korea-antitrust-regulator-fines-google-177-million.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company disagreed with the ruling, and argued that Android’s policies had allowed Korean phone manufacturers and developers to be successful, and had created opportunities for innovation. “The KFTC’s decision released today ignores these benefits, and will undermine the advantages enjoyed by consumers,” the spokesperson said, adding that Google plans to appeal the ruling. Google has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-has-helped-create-more-choice/"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; that its AFAs are necessary to ensure that apps work across more Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lCgPu"&gt;In addition to smartphones, Android is used on devices like smartwatches and smart TVs. Korea’s regulator said that today’s ruling also applies to these other categories. “Corrective measures included emerging smart device-related areas such as smartwatches and smart TVs,” Chairperson Joh Sung-wook said in comments reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqjS3"&gt;The ruling comes on the same day as the so-called “anti-Google law” goes into force in South Korea. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;new law&lt;/a&gt; requires major platform owners like Google and Apple to allow developers to use third-party payment systems in their apps. Both companies had previously required developers to use only the built-in payment processes for in-app purchases, which in most cases results in Apple and Google collecting a 30 percent cut of transactions. Similarly, a US judge ruled last week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Apple can’t stop developers&lt;/a&gt; from linking to other payment methods as a result of legal action brought by Epic Games. The decision on Epic v. Google is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuuebI"&gt;As well as Google’s anti-fragmentation agreements, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Korean regulator is also investigating alleged competition restrictions in Google’s Play Store app market, in-app purchases, and the ad market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s G435 is a lightweight, feature-packed wireless gaming headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrZQc_LAoT9-GSZoKVWPtpYeWP8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855140/g435hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A PC/PlayStation headset that uses beamforming mics instead of a boom mic.&lt;/em&gt; | Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="os91UD"&gt;Many of Logitech’s previous wireless gaming headsets cost more than $100, but its latest is a relative bargain without compromising too much on comfort or features. The G435 Lightspeed costs $80, comes in three colorways, and can connect wirelessly to a PC or PlayStation console via its USB dongle, and to a phone, tablet, or other devices via a low-latency Bluetooth connection (Logitech didn’t share specific millisecond latency specs in time for publication). The headset will be available sometime in September 2021 from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FLogitechG.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22665355%2Flogitech-g435-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebxt3D"&gt;Its design picks up where the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21378026/logitech-g733-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-headset-accessories-g203-g305-g915-colors"&gt;G733 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; left off, with lots of color, breathable mesh fabric, and plastic all around. There are some differences, both cosmetic and functional. Logitech says the G435 Lightspeed was designed primarily for smaller heads, as it’s angling this model to a younger generation. Though, it still fits my large-sized head easily. The ear cups are on rails that allow for easy adjustment, whether you want to make them fit a bigger or smaller head.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G435 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rg3LVNmrhXX4AVBxNK0J5yhkN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839633/g435black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the buttons are on the left ear cup. From top to bottom, there’s the power button, volume up / down, the mute on the bottom. Holding mute toggles between 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NhbMB2"&gt;The G435 Lightspeed looks like a traditional wireless gaming headset, except for one major omission: a boom microphone. That’s not to say it doesn’t have a mic at all. Instead of having a physical mic, Logitech employed dual beamforming microphones built into the left earcup that aim to achieve similar results without having a mic right in front of your mouth. During my week of testing, it did a good job picking up my voice and leaving out the sound from my noisy window air conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM2e62"&gt;This may be the lightest gaming headset that I’ve worn yet, weighing 165 grams. The frame and headband are mostly plastic throughout, but Logitech nailed two important aspects about fit: making sure the headset doesn’t feel like it’s weighing down on your head or clamping around your ears too hard. Impressively, there’s barely any cushioning around the headband, just a thin piece of breathable fabric wrapped around it. Yet, there were no issues regarding comfort during my time with the G435. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blue and pink colorway shown here is the most vibrant option available for the G435.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zC5y7u"&gt;It’s understandable that for $80 the G435’s build materials might come into question. And yes, with the headset in hand, it feels well-constructed but a little on the chintzy side. To Logitech’s credit, the sound quality is quite a bit better than I expected from a headset at this price, to the point where I didn’t really care about any quibbles I had with the build materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x713Y3"&gt;Rounding up a few more specs, this model charges via USB-C and claims to reach up to 18 hours of battery life per charge. To switch between getting audio from the included USB dongle and Bluetooth, the G435 requires you to manually swap sources by holding the mute button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiNI1E"&gt;If you’re in the market for an affordable wireless gaming headset, the number of options worth checking out is growing, thankfully. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android"&gt;Razer Barracuda X&lt;/a&gt; launching for $100, and this model coming in at $80, it’s easier now to find a console-friendly headset that won’t break the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi shows off concept smart glasses with MicroLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlLevqZCaH7sItrH6DbunnggfcQ=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855085/_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osgDd9"&gt;Xiaomi has announced a pair of smart glasses called Xiaomi Smart Glasses. A company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there’s no plan to actually put them on sale, but Xiaomi has provided enough detail to make the concept product seem somewhat plausible — at least for some point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIuBiE"&gt;Xiaomi’s glasses have a relatively conventional form factor, but unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Facebook and Ray Ban’s just-announced Stories glasses&lt;/a&gt;, they actually do have a display that can be used for AR features. Xiaomi says it went with a monochrome MicroLED system because of its “higher pixel density and longer lifespan while having a simpler structure” when compared to OLED. According to Xiaomi, MicroLED “allows for a more compact display, as well as easier screen integration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSTCwS"&gt;MicroLED is a self-emissive display technology that is widely viewed as the natural successor to OLED. However, it remains prohibitively expensive and is yet to be deployed in more than a handful of commercial products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVsO9egW8M7X5pnQ5DzBu-aa9bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849119/WX20210914_095340.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XqJOjA"&gt;Xiaomi’s display is “roughly the size of a grain of rice” at 2.4mm x 2.02mm and has a peak brightness of 2 million nits. The light won’t be that bright once it actually reaches your eye, of course — the extreme brightness is so it can still be visible in direct sunlight after passing through an optical waveguide lens, which refracts and directs the light. Xiaomi cites use cases like navigation, live translation, and notifications for the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sykuZE"&gt;The glasses themselves are an independent Android device that don’t require a constant phone connection — Xiaomi suggests they could even replace your phone someday. There’s an unspecified quad-core Arm processor, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules, a battery, and a five-megapixel camera on board. Xiaomi says the glasses weigh just 51 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C92kDP"&gt;As mentioned upfront, these glasses aren’t going to be available to the public and may not actually even exist, so you should view Xiaomi’s claims with skepticism. However, coming after Facebook’s announcement and right before Apple’s iPhone event, the concept demonstration is a clear indicator that Xiaomi wants to be considered as a player in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;
