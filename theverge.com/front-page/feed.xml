    <title>Amid calls for CEO resignation, Activision Blizzard announces a workplace committee</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xbdEJC"&gt;In the fight against ongoing allegations of harassment, discrimination, and complaints of insufficient action to address such allegations, Activision Blizzard’s board of directors has announced that the publisher is forming a new committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9yzjdm"&gt;The Activision Blizzard board of directors today announced that it has formed a ‘Workplace Responsibility Committee,’ initially comprised of two independent directors, to oversee the company’s progress in successfully implementing its new policies, procedures, and commitments to improve workplace culture and eliminate all forms of harassment and discrimination at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rIb8WE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-continues-build-upon-its"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; — delivered at an extremely late hour during an employee holiday week granted hours before the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;a damning &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; — seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;reaffirms the board’s support for CEO Bobby Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, even as major publishers express concern about and evaluate relationships with Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsIufJ"&gt;Late last week, Nintendo joined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; to become the latest publisher to internally criticize the company. According to a report from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/news/nintendo-issues-internal-response-to-activision-blizzard-reports/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fanbyte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser wrote an email saying, “I find these accounts distressing and disturbing. They run counter to my values as well as Nintendo’s beliefs, values, and policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0sQz4"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s new committee will ensure regular progress updates to the board concerning key accountability measures while promising to add a “new, diverse director to the board.” Meanwhile, as external pressure mounts, a cohort of shareholders have demanded Kotick’s resignation while employees staged a second walkout and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;created a petition&lt;/a&gt; with over 1,800 signatures similarly demanding the CEO step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09ZD5l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSqrUb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche acquires a majority stake in high-end electric bike maker Greyp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jo_UXI3w91huw-0LKirvKPaHo6w=/2x0:1199x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182725/download__3_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZwNae"&gt;Croatian electric bike manufacturer Greyp Bikes has a new majority shareholder: Porsche. The sports car manufacturer’s venture capital arm, Porsche Ventures, has held a stake of around 10 percent in the e-bike company since 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwEMmW"&gt;Greyp (pronounced like the fruit) was founded Mate Rimac — aka &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55938754"&gt;“Croatia’s Elon Musk”&lt;/a&gt; — the brainchild behind electric supercar startup Rimac Automobili. The company makes highly connected, extremely powerful electric mountain bikes, including the $10,000 flagship, full-suspension G6. The company sells its bikes in Europe and recently launched its US operations based in San Pedro, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHxnne"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The investment is another sign of Porsche’s confidence in Rimac’s business prowess&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JlgeVL"&gt;The investment is another sign of Porsche’s confidence in Rimac’s business prowess. The automaker also owns a small stake in Rimac Automobili, which it bought at the same time it initially purchased shares in Greyp. Rimac recently announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563898/bugatti-rimac-electric-supercar-acquisitoin-deal"&gt;taking over Bugatti&lt;/a&gt; from Porsche’s parent company, Volkswagen, to form a new company called Bugatti Rimac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Em4kx"&gt;The increased investment comes at a time of accelerated growth in the world of e-bikes. Sales of e-bikes are growing faster than traditional bikes in most major markets. The pandemic was a big factor, with sales increasing 145 percent from 2019 to 2020, more than double the rate of non-motorized bikes, according to the market research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR66yp"&gt;Porsche characterized the decision to take a controlling interest in Greyp as part of its broader plan to invest in zero- and low-emission vehicles, including plug-in hybrid vehicles and the all-electric Porsche Taycan. The company has said it will have a carbon neutral “balance sheet” by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4afmL"&gt;Porsche is no stranger to the world of e-bikes. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313508/porsche-electric-bike-ebike-sport-cross-specs-price"&gt;the automaker unveiled&lt;/a&gt; a pair of high-priced, full-suspension electric mountain bikes, the Sport and the Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRKjln"&gt;The Sport is a road bike intended for everyday use, with a full-suspension carbon fiber frame, integrated front and rear lights, Shimano mid-drive motor, and a $10,700 price tag. The Cross, which is more for off-roading adventures, sports a Shimano mid-drive, carbon fiber frame, and full suspension frame, in addition to Magura-MT Trail hydraulic disc brakes that are extra-large and “heat resistant.” It weighs 48.7 pounds and retails for $8,549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVOs7T"&gt;Porsche is the latest company specializing in combustion engine vehicles to dip a toe into the world of electric two-wheelers. Often, when you hear about car companies releasing their own electric bikes, it’s just a brand licensing deal. (Think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161230/jeep-ebike-electric-bike-quietkat-manufacturer-preorder-price-specs-date"&gt;Jeep’s e-bike&lt;/a&gt; or those &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/news030317-humbike/"&gt;Hummer bikes&lt;/a&gt; from last decade.) Other times, it’s a much-hyped project that ends up falling victim to larger corporate cost-cutting, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256722/gm-ariv-shuts-down-ebike-production-covid"&gt;General Motors’ Ariv e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. But occasionally, something interesting emerges, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;Harley-Davidson’s recently released Serial 1 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit winds down Dubsmash, but its video creation tools live on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HoouZmlFObs57Mnvu-BE-EdD62E=/0x27:1600x1094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182695/reddit_new_filters.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nrE5ni"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features"&gt;Reddit will shut down&lt;/a&gt; its short-form video platform, Dubsmash, on February 22nd, 2022. After February, the app will no longer be available on apps stores and will stop functioning on devices that already have the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Feyuj"&gt;A competitor to TikTok, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173774/reddit-acquires-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-short-form-video-tools"&gt;Dubsmash was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit late last year with the purpose of embedding its video creation tools into the larger platform. Now that the integration is nearing completion, Reddit is introducing a slew of new video creation tools to its own TikTok-like video feed, courtesy of the Dubsmash team that came over with the buyout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRXEpm"&gt;“Our primary focus, in terms of the acquisition, was around bringing in the expertise from the team, as well as bringing in the technology that we had built over the past five years at Dubsmash,” said Suchit Dash, the vice president of video at Reddit and a co-founder of Dubsmash, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQ5BPi7wYAM-gm8510dYN2JR9m8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035065/bread_gif_face_reddit.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LCX8hE"&gt;As a part of the update, Reddit is overhauling its camera — it’s adding features that let you change the speed of your video, set a timer, adjust and trim multiple clips, as well as upload videos to the platform in landscape, portrait, and fill modes. Reddit is also devising exclusive lenses, including one that puts your (or your pet’s) face inside a slice of bread, as well as another that plants the antenna from Snoo (Reddit’s mascot) atop your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZmsXH"&gt;The platform is implementing a more full-featured editing screen as well, which should make it easier to edit videos in-app rather than force you to use external editing tools. It will now let you apply filters, add voiceovers, make volume adjustments, use stickers, rearrange your clips, and experiment with its drawing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vmk58C"&gt;While a number of Dubsmash’s innovations are coming over to Reddit, it may struggle to recreate &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/30/951627331/dubsmash-creators-of-color-say-they-deserve-credit-and-money-on-tiktok"&gt;Dubsmash’s vibrant community&lt;/a&gt;. Since Dubsmash’s initial 2014 debut, the app became &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/reddit-buys-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-black-latinx-creators-1234655872/"&gt;a hub for many Black and Latinx creators&lt;/a&gt;, who will have to jump to another app — or maybe even Reddit — ahead of its closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YwqR2W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re starting largely with our mobile clients, but we have ambition to go beyond that”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PI5Ydk"&gt;Dash said that video is now picking up in popularity on Reddit itself. “It’s one of our fastest-growing content types,” he said. This year alone, Reddit saw a 70 percent uptick in overall video hours watched, along with a 30 percent increase in daily active video viewers. Viewership for short videos, which Reddit defines as two seconds or less, has also risen by 50 percent quarter over quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJTKIb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623724/reddit-titktok-video-feed-ios-app"&gt;The platform launched a TikTok-style feed&lt;/a&gt; on its iOS app in August, featuring an endless stream of short videos that you can downvote, upvote, comment on, share, or award. When asked when the video feed would be coming to Android, Dash told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Reddit is “beginning the process of rolling that out on Android clients” and also hinted that the same video feed may be coming to web as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZxQII"&gt;“Our goal is to make sure that we can actually allow for everyone who’s on Reddit — regardless of the platform that they use — to have a great video experience,” Dash said. “We’re starting largely with our mobile clients, but we have ambition to go beyond that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ1wYY"&gt;As to whether Reddit has any plans to integrate sounds or music into its creation tools, which TikTok popularized and other social platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785043/snapchat-sony-music-major-labels"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; quickly caught on to, it looks like that’s not happening anytime soon. “We’re always really excited to see new use cases for creators, so no plans for us,” Dash told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But we’re always exploring new ways of what we can bring to the community.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 10 is coming to the six-year-old Fairphone 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9thYGVNA03I7__AH41dobgbzCB8=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182551/jvincent_160412_1017_8176.0.0.1484136509.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;2015’s Fairphone 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Vincent / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y9aouK"&gt;Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has released an Android 10 update for the six-year-old Fairphone 2, a device that originally launched with Android 5 in 2015. The update is in beta for the time being, but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F11%2FFairphone-to-upgrade-six-year-old-Fairphone-2-to-Android-10-providing-users-with-unprecedented-seven-years-of-support.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it hopes to release a stable version early next year. Alongside it, the company also plans to start beta testing an Android 11 update for the 2019 Fairphone 3 and 2020 Fairphone 3 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmzavO"&gt;Although getting an Android update two years after its original release wouldn’t normally be cause for celebration, it’s basically unheard of for an Android manufacturer to still be updating a handset six years after its original release. Only Apple comes close to these kinds of support periods and recently released its latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;iOS 15 update for the 2015 iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j3avgV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beta testing of Android 10 for Fairphone 2 starts today, with the aim to be publicly available in early 2022. But the good news doesn’t end there – for Fairphone 3 and 3+ users, beta testing for Android 11 also starts this week.&lt;/p&gt;— Fairphone (@Fairphone) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fairphone/status/1463138305176973323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98F8Or"&gt;Meanwhile, Samsung offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;three generational Android updates&lt;/a&gt; for its recent phones. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones%2Cpixel-pixel-pro-phones%2Cpixel-a-a-xl-xl-a-a-g-a-g"&gt;Google has promised&lt;/a&gt; to provide security updates for its latest Pixel 6 devices for five years and Android version updates for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCOPo"&gt;Offering updates for this length of time isn’t easy, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F06%2F18%2Ffairphone-2-gets-android-9%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F23%2F22798512%2Ffairphone-2-android-10-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fairphone explained&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post when it released its public beta of Android 9 running on the Fairphone 2. One of the bigger challenges is that the chipset manufacturer Fairphone uses, Qualcomm, only offers support for its processors for a certain number of years. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/qualcomm-promises-three-years-of-android-updates-for-its-entire-soc-lineup/"&gt;As of last December&lt;/a&gt;, Qualcomm supports its chips for three major OS updates and four years of security updates. However, once this support ends, manufacturers like Fairphone are on their own if they want to continue keeping their phones updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNtusy"&gt;For the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update, the company says it collaborated with its community to speed up the update process. Together with help from Indian software developer Bharath Ravi Prakash, Fairphone says the Fairphone 2’s Android 10 update took just 10 months to develop, compared to 18 months for Android 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQiaZt"&gt;Today’s news will be welcome for anyone still using a Fairphone 2 who wants to benefit from Android 10 features like gesture navigation and support for an OS-level dark mode. But it’s also reassuring for anyone thinking about picking up its latest phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone 4&lt;/a&gt;, which the company hopes to keep supported for six years until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there’s little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It’s even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; until Saturday, November 27th. Several retailers are honoring this promotion, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2XJSUmC5J" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2-standalone%2Fp%2FN82E16826910033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/oculus-quest-2-all-in-one-vr-headset---256-gb-with-quest-2-carrying-case.product.100797536.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Foculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb%2F-%2FA-83984421%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F508466743&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a similar deal&lt;/a&gt;, though in lieu of a gift card, it’s including the zip-up case as a complementary goodie without changing the $299.99 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8axuK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B09DCMWRKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon gets a special mention for its bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the 128GB headset, a hard carrying case, along with a $50 Amazon credit for the regular $299.99 price. Head to this link and use &lt;strong&gt;OCULUS50 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to get in on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKJoid"&gt;This gift card promo happening at several retailers extends to the $399.99 headset that doubles the storage to 256GB, which includes a $50 gift card as well. Just note that you’ll earn a gift card to the retailer where you purchased the Oculus Quest 2, unless you buy it from Oculus directly. In that case, you’ll get $50 of credit to use on &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;games purchased digitally&lt;/a&gt; through the Oculus Store. If you’re a fan of creepy first-person shooters, I highly suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ux7Typ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyqXUu"&gt;You’re welcome to use your gift card however you like, but if you’re open to suggestions, I’d use it on either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ tough, zip-up case for the headset&lt;/a&gt; and its controllers, or its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap that makes the Quest 2 much more comfortable to wear&lt;/a&gt;. Each cost $50, so choose wisely (or get both, knowing that you’re spending only half as much as you would have normally to kit out your new headset).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OzekPZTFqvEC621SgVNqNxikdec=/5x0:1460x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182339/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_2.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting the LG C1 OLED TV won’t be cheap, but it’s among the best options out there.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmhxDE"&gt;4K TVs of all sizes and specs see price cuts several times throughout the year, but the time when we usually see the highest concentration of stellar deals is right now, as Black Friday hits and Cyber Monday is just around the bend. You’ve ended up in the right place if you’re looking for a TV deal, and yes, that includes people interested in a TV that has every bell or whistle, with the highest contrast ratio and the right features to eke all of the visual splendor from PCs and the latest gaming consoles or something that’s quite the opposite. We’ll be highlighting affordable TVs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGhjh8"&gt;Our team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is hard at work on compiling the best Black Friday deals, running the gamut of retailers participating, as well as breaking it down on a category level. If you don’t know what you want but you’re itching to see the deals, head to our roundup of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;the best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; for a more general overview of the internet’s best offers. Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;head to our big Black Friday landing page&lt;/a&gt; and choose your jumping-off point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z9oQMP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787892/apple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals on Google tech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22788031/google-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="bjuxxr"&gt;Samsung TV deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UhATMC"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uKqmoG9m" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung 55-inch Q60A QLED TV&lt;/a&gt; is $700 at Best Buy, down from $800. This model is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-75-Inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B08VWBF7C1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11QJho"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uM0X6Nan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 65-inch Q80A QLED TV&lt;/a&gt; with full-array local dimming is $1,200 at Best Buy, down from $1,400.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DUmO9L"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uPH49gJM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 70-inch TU6985 LED TV&lt;/a&gt; that’s all about size and cost-effectiveness is $600 at Best Buy, down from $750.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWWElf"&gt;Sony deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CFELaP"&gt;The 65-inch Bravia XR X90J with full-array local dimming for better contrast costs $1,200 at Best Buy, down from $1,500. If all you need is a 50-inch TV, this same model is available in that size for $900 from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uXT44hQ9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X90J-Inch-Compatibility-XR50X90J/dp/B08TLC4C4T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1slr8"&gt;If you want an OLED, Sony’s Bravia XR A80J with a 65-inch OLED panel costs $1,800 instead of its original $2,300 cost at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uW7MVOb8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-A80J-Inch-Compatibility-XR65A80J/dp/B08TKR3WLJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IPisjL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10831129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ODiTbB"&gt;A much smaller OLED from Sony is discounted at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3uYGj86Hp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 48-inch Bravia A9S&lt;/a&gt; is available for $1,200, down $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gzfyQQ"&gt;LG deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WoVMMm"&gt;The most affordable OLED TV from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u0CKA2Rz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG is its A1&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available in its 48-inch size for just $900 (usually $1,200). This model has a 60Hz refresh rate, and it lacks HDMI 2.1 ports, unlike LG’s pricier 2021 OLED TVs, but it can still deliver stellar picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mjEyBM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YTId2z"&gt;If you don’t want to compromise on any features, LG’s C1 OLED might be the right fit for you. The 48-inch model is $1,100 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u22rW6q4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED48C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFK81RH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down $200 from its usual price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JyDucB"&gt;For something that’s far less costly, LG’s 50-inch NanoCell 75 series model costs just $500 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u35pqIuB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-75NANO75UPA-Alexa-Built-NanoCell/dp/B08WHW3VX1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small $70 discount from what it previously sold for. Usually, jumping up to a massive 70-inch TV is an egregious jump in price, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vphRZMsd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this model is available in its 70-inch size for just $750&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LBJXAT"&gt;LG also makes a NanoCell 90 series TV that has full-array dimming zones for improved fidelity in low-lit or high contrast scenes. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3u87RD6b5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can get a 55-inch version&lt;/a&gt; for $900 at Best Buy, down from its original $1,100 price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="26F66P"&gt;Insignia deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8b6eCx"&gt;Insignia’s televisions cost significantly less than any of the brands above. While they likely can’t win in a head-to-head competition for panel and backlighting quality against many other LED TVs, at least they compete in terms of functionality. Each of them has Amazon’s Fire TV software built-in, so you don’t need to buy extra streaming hardware (most models come with some form of this feature, whether it’s Android TV, Google TV, Roku, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="abkwsj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vauWNY9G" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch F30 LED TV&lt;/a&gt; costs just $300 at Best Buy and Amazon, well below its original $550 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bClIqR"&gt;For a step up in visual quality (particularly its contrast) thanks to quantum dot technology, the Insignia F50 55-inch TV costs $400 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ve1q77bV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-55-inch-4K-Fire-TV/dp/B08X7JBQ6F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This model usually costs $650 outside of a sale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jq9k3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797476"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="smFTIN"&gt;Insignia makes several sizes of each of its TVs, and you’re guaranteed to find a low price on all of them, so pick the one that works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FSv7hk"&gt;Vizio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KkdJyK"&gt;Vizio’s mid-range &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vWptw98X" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M7 QLED 4K TV with a 50-inch screen&lt;/a&gt; starts at the low price of $500 (usually $700) at Best Buy. This model has a 60Hz refresh rate, but its full-array local dimming is an impressive feature at this price point. If you want a bigger version of the M7, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vXZiAhCw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 70-inch model is just $750&lt;/a&gt; (usually $1,100) at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g19Rkk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDnJ6m"&gt;The best TV that Vizio makes that isn’t an OLED is its P-series Quantum. You can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vY9ks5Wm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch PQ9 for $1,000&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off) at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uqhrQ"&gt;Now, for Vizio’s debut OLED (a Best Buy-exclusive model), the discounts actually aren’t great so far. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3wjdxwkiv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 55-inch model is $1,000&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off), while the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3whqAM5hi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch version is $1,500&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off). These aren’t the best-ever prices; they’re off by a couple hundred dollars, actually. Feature-wise, they’re competitive with LG’s C1, though some people report that this model’s software is one of its weakest attributes. If you can look past some of those issues, though, it might be worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BKzbvy"&gt;TCL deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WFLXcV"&gt;TCL’s TVs are known best for their Roku integration, but the company more recently started to produce models that run on Android TV or Google TV. It’s a vastly different interface from Roku’s, and it’ll ship with a different kind of remote control, but many of the same features are there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xdbdf"&gt;But that’s not all the decision comes down to. Sometimes, specs will be different, making one model better than the other. The way that TCL names its TVs indicates its quality, more or less. Its 6-series is among the best (and most costly) it offers, while anything lower than that will be a slight step down in features and specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oYaAFX"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vkS85LOI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s 55-inch 4-series TV with Android TV&lt;/a&gt; software costs $380 at Best Buy, down from $450. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrjlTa3N" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;If you want that exact TV in the Roku flavor&lt;/a&gt;, it’s $20 cheaper at Best Buy, costing $360.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KwCAX6"&gt;Stepping up in quality, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vwvQCzGU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s 5-series 4K TV with Roku software&lt;/a&gt; and a 50-inch QLED panel costs $450 at Best Buy (down from $600). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vwPpTZpp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL makes an identical version with Google TV software&lt;/a&gt; for the same $450 price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="AyViM1"&gt;Finally, TCL’s high-end 6-series TV is seeing some great discounts, too. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vxAVRNIJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 55-inch model with Roku software&lt;/a&gt;, Mini LED backlighting, and a QLED panel costs $700 instead of $950 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HhDMLc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k2pC5S"&gt;You can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885N17CC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model of the 6-series with Roku software&lt;/a&gt; for $898, down from $1,500 at Amazon. For an even bigger &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vziiO37l" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch version of the 6-series TV,&lt;/a&gt; but with Google TV software, Best Buy has you set for $1,300 ($1,000 off its original price).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D51R4e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s Netflix hub includes some exclusive audio extras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bL1FsAi6DV2MWaserk2SBJT158k=/52x0:1996x1296/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182323/netflix_spotify_music.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4m1ZiY"&gt;Spotify has introduced a new hub that’s home to all the music from Netflix’s shows and movies. A &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-23/get-even-more-squid-game-bridgerton-and-money-heist-with-our-new-netflix-collaboration-and-dedicated-hub/"&gt;post on Spotify’s newsroom&lt;/a&gt; explains that both free and premium users can access the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/netflix"&gt;Netflix hub&lt;/a&gt; by searching for “Netflix” on Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBKkHD"&gt;There, you’ll find official playlists from Netflix TV shows like &lt;em&gt;La Casa de Papel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;On My Block&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, along with the official soundtracks from &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bruised&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, and more. It also includes some of Netflix’s official podcasts, such as &lt;em&gt;Okay, Now Listen, Netflix Is a Daily Joke&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; 10/10 (Would Recommend)&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Crown: The Official Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, all of which you can access from this single location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xhO3Sy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify has rolled out an “enhanced album experience” for Netflix’s The Harder They Fall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="912kYy"&gt;Spotify has also rolled out an “&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6IgPnyVYfHg"&gt;enhanced album experience&lt;/a&gt;” for the streaming platform’s new film, &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;. This gives you access to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie’s soundtrack, which includes songs from Jay-Z, Kid Cudi, Koffee, and Ms. Lauryn Hill. Aside from all that, Spotify has added new content to &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/netflix_lcdp"&gt;its &lt;em&gt;La Casa De Papel&lt;/em&gt; page&lt;/a&gt; (which doesn’t seem to be working at the moment) and is even offering &lt;a href="https://www.lacasadepapel.withspotify.com/"&gt;a quiz&lt;/a&gt; that’s supposed to match your personality with a La Banda character from the show and an accompanying soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMkrVi"&gt;Netflix isn’t the first entertainment giant that Spotify has collaborated with. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20696982/spotify-disney-hub-animated-film-live-action-pixar-marvel-star-wars-lion-king-frozen"&gt;In 2019, Spotify launched&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/disney-page"&gt;Disney hub&lt;/a&gt;, which contains official Disney playlists, soundtracks, and Disney-themed podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox’s 20th Anniversary museum is a metaverse full of achievements and mistakes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ym7dgY5OzpyQTG7diS5F-0dEGTU=/133x0:1863x1153/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182280/HGWv24g.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3opEas"&gt;Microsoft has created an &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/"&gt;Xbox metaverse museum&lt;/a&gt; where you can roam around and discover the history of Xbox consoles. It’s designed to celebrate 20 years of Xbox and includes some infamous mistakes like the &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/en/content/xbox-360-screen-8"&gt;Xbox 360 red ring of death&lt;/a&gt; or Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/en/content/original-xbox-screen-5"&gt;attempt to acquire Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; in spring 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehF08a"&gt;As you roam around this &lt;a href="https://museum.xbox.com/"&gt;Xbox museum&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see fellow Xbox players interacting with the digital exhibits and charting the progress of the original Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and the latest Xbox Series X / S consoles. Each moment in the 20-year timeline has an associated story, usually with a video documenting the milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ztQyPUXL_H0e3u5n_EB3HQhv7Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037211/xboxmuseum.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox museum is a metaverse full of achievements and failures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sWYYiV"&gt;There’s even a personal Xbox museum, so if you’ve ever owned an Xbox console, you can look back at what games you played first on certain consoles, the number of games you’ve played, and even when you first signed into Xbox Live. For some reason, &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first games I played on Xbox 360, and I apparently first signed into Xbox Live 18 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUKgWY"&gt;You can explore a total of 132 moments in Xbox history throughout the metaverse museum and navigate around using WASD on a keyboard. Each moment has its own link, and you can even share your own anniversary museum section with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vEIjF9i4Ypr6eytjox7ORSEutwY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037193/dpoiSkY.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a personalized museum for each Xbox player.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City is a feature-length fan film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A still from Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A4YH208iffxqkHOn6kbO563GmRo=/0x0:5030x3353/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182278/Day31_ResidentEvil_5676_r.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aLMnz"&gt;For years, Capcom’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; franchise has been split in half. There’s the game and animated film series built closely around Shinji Mikami’s 1996 survival horror game. Then there’s the live-action series, a half-dozen barely related blockbusters starring Milla Jovovich. But the newly released &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; aims to change that. It’s a jump-scare-filled live-action adaptation of the earliest &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; games, and it plays out like a 107-minute fan film — which isn’t entirely a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DruWsl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following includes mild narrative and thematic spoilers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrkB09"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt;, written and directed by Johannes Roberts, merges the plots and characters of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt;. In the year 1998, the grim post-industrial town of Raccoon City has just lost its biggest employer, the Umbrella Corporation. To make things worse, college student Claire Redfield (Kaya Scodelario) believes Umbrella has polluted the town’s water with a mysterious and dangerous substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wEsSug"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City feels built to be dissected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82Vr8C"&gt;Claire’s elite police operative brother, Chris Redfield (Robbie Amell), initially doesn’t believe her. Then Chris, his trigger-happy partner Jill Valentine (Hannah John-Kamen), and hunky blond heartthrob Albert Wesker (Tom Hopper) are called to investigate a killing in a &lt;a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion"&gt;deserted mansion&lt;/a&gt;. Raccoon City’s population turns into flesh-eating zombies. Claire must team up with rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy (Avan Jogia) to escape. Along the way, she starts to unravel another mystery that’s bothered her for years: a grotesque creature that tried to befriend her as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9pcstm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4q6UGCyHZCI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dJX8hB"&gt;Roberts, who previously directed aquatic horror movie &lt;em&gt;47 Meters Down&lt;/em&gt;, has &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-director-johannes-roberts-interview-movie-adaptation-games/"&gt;described his project&lt;/a&gt; as a “pure” adaptation compared to previous films. And &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City &lt;/em&gt;seems built to be dissected by fans. Its intertextual references will probably fill countless online Easter egg guides. I’m not a big enough &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; completionist to fill those guides, but I got the palpable sense of watching something where the creators were showing their homework to gain viewers’ trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUzUVQ"&gt;There’s a specific joy in watching scenes you love from other media get played out by real people in a movie, and Roberts has a good sense of what makes individual moments of translation satisfying. The filmmakers compose shots to evoke elements from the games even when the narrative context is different. They aren’t beholden to casting actors who look exactly like their in-game counterparts, but they hold onto details like Claire Redfield’s iconic red jacket. The script buys wholeheartedly into &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil’s&lt;/em&gt; weird narrative quirks, like Raccoon City’s &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-22-how-resident-evil-2s-map-uses-familiarity-against-you"&gt;implausibly ornate police station&lt;/a&gt;, rather than trying to rationalize them or lampshade them with a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QA8Iym"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does any evil corporation really need this many hidden tunnels?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FDT1NN"&gt;The tradeoff is that &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; feels almost surreal through any other lens. If you’re not on board with &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil’s&lt;/em&gt; mythos, you may find yourself wondering things like: “Why does a pharmaceutical corporation have a quasi-military strike force capable of containing an entire small town?” or “How does this small town have enough orphans to fill a school-sized building?” or “Did the corporation &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to dig a secret tunnel network that is accessed with playing-card-themed keys, and how long are those tunnels, anyway?” If you asked me to draw a map of Raccoon City after watching this movie, it would look like a tesseract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcjPlb"&gt;The feeling is compounded by the cast’s incredibly calm performances. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; is a gory mess of dismemberment, accidental self-immolation, and ravening zombie mobs, and its survivors seem moderately irritated by these developments at best.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Leon Kennedy, in particular, is played less like a fresh-faced cop out of his depth and more like a character from Jim Jarmusch’s deadpan satire &lt;em&gt;The Dead Don’t Die&lt;/em&gt; or possibly an exasperated mailroom intern perpetually on the verge of stapling his own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="M0xI07"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The film glosses over a lot of very weird source material&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0c87R8"&gt;The issue isn’t that &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; is unrealistic or that I couldn’t pore over a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; wiki to answer the questions above, but that the oddities never pay off. Things like Leon’s casual ineptitude could be effective comedy, but other characters stay similarly nonchalant through events the narrative suggests should devastate them. And instead of leaning into video game set pieces that look absolutely bizarre in a live-action film, the film glosses over them in favor of more generic action scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkNuH0"&gt;Despite this, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; goes a long way by gleefully embracing primal creepiness. Its first 20 minutes push every available button to freak viewers out: eerie dolls, rasping voices from the shadows, scrawled warnings from strange creatures, cheerful children’s drawings with ominous undertones, and much more. It evolves quickly into an action-horror narrative after this, but it still draws on the strength of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil’s&lt;/em&gt; spooky aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrPCpl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt; gets a lot of moment-to-moment elements right. It’s a film that’s straight-faced without being pretentious, full of over-the-top genre tropes without falling into grating, campy self-awareness. But it’s sunk so deep in a decades-old fictional world that it can’t look beyond its boundaries. The film delivers a checklist to remind viewers why they like &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil —&lt;/em&gt; but it sometimes seems to forget what’s actually on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmmspA"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; will premiere in theaters November 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals for Black Friday on true wireless earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLBEwG"&gt;One of the most sought-after gifts every holiday — at least, ever since Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone — has been true wireless earbuds. They are often the favored listening device of many people because they offer the most convenience, and they’re a product category that frequently goes on sale. Full-size headphones offer superior sound, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;those have their fair share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday discounts&lt;/a&gt; to be had, but most casual listeners often prefer earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2rBqw"&gt;Here, we have rounded up all the best early Black Friday deals we can find on wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Jabra, Beats, and even Google, as well as a couple of lesser-known brands. Each has its own unique qualities or value proposition to offer, and we have deals spanning the range that can fit into any budget — starting with premium models and extending all the way to entry-level options still worth your listening time and money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xnjFFz"&gt;Samsung’s sequel to its original Galaxy Buds, the Galaxy Buds Plus, offer improved sound quality, and they’re not just $79 for Black Friday at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-improved-Charging-included/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922%3Fathbdg%3DL1300&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. That’s nearly half their full price of $150. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bU3yW4"&gt;The Google Pixel Buds A-series are a lower-cost option of the Pixel Buds that finally started to get wireless earbuds right for Google, and being cheaper helps this model to be even more appealing. It’s a solid earbud for any Android user, but maybe most desirable if you’re a Pixel phone owner. You can pick them up for just $79 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vBW7Etnr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Pixel-Buds-A-Series-Truly-Wireless-Earbuds-Audio-Headphones-with-Bluetooth-White%2F620970985&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1635922-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02213_us_pixel_buds_a_series_true.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792011%2Fblack-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWqOnU"&gt;The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 are not going to win any notable awards in any particular categories, but they’re fine for a basic set of earbuds from a reputable brand that just cost &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Bluetooth-Earphones-Personalized-Cancelling/dp/B07SKJNCXM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45 ($5 off) at&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for Black Friday. They even have wireless charging and solid battery life. Think of it as stepping into stocking stuffer territory, but you’re not buying the equivalent of a true wireless lump of coal.&lt;/li&gt;
