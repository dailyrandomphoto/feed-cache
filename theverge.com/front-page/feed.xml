    <title>The biggest announcements from DC FanDome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W-yA-vsO2n9FtMjlAkaBfkrGw4g=/191x0:1679x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70005058/black_adam.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Adam was one of the trailers on display at DC FanDome Saturday | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;DC/WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hn0LmM"&gt;DC Comics and Warner Bros. held their second annual Fandome &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mZVhDm"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ZX4OUb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqqft2x_Aa4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9u9UJx"&gt;The Batman shows off Robert Pattinson’s gritty hero&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HaEUem"&gt;We got a second trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, at last (and FanDome saved the reveal for the very end of the day). We’re not even sure if he thinks he &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a hero, but Pattison’s Batman is definitely Going Through Some Stuff. We didn’t learn a heck of a lot more about the characters in Matt Reeves’ interpretation of the Dark Knight’s saga. But the trailer showed off a Selina Kyle/Catwoman who seemed to be a master of disguises, and a Riddler with a much scarier vibe than we’ve seen in previous iterations. After several pandemic-related delays, The Batman comes to theaters on March 4th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22k2ue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6BSeQR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/isf3Kpgk9VA?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=29&amp;amp;start=29" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rYPDAQ"&gt;An early look at Dwayne Johnson as Shazam antihero &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pKXKkx"&gt;Dwayne Johnson’s &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt; has been in development for years, but the long-gestating film is finally almost here, and has a teaser trailer showing off not just Johnson’s character&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;but also several members of the Justice Society of America who’ll be making their debuts. Johnson himself made an appearance at FanDome and said he was “born to play Black Adam,” before introducing a scene from the movie, which saw some archeologists (who should know better, frankly) hit Black Adam with a blast of electricity. In return, he disintegrates one guy, catches a bullet out of thin air, and then levitates away. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20"&gt;Johnson tweeted the clip&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHTw9I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on July 29th, 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tjCDi0"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ZsuvWx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9vFB65-U_c?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CJoi5R"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; got a gameplay reveal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vvqbMc"&gt;Announced at last year’s FanDome and the first game from Rocksteady Studios, the team behind the beloved &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham&lt;/em&gt; in nearly six years, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League got a proper gameplay reveal at this years event. The game is set to debut on Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aFzod7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JK-F2rsNeIk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d3Jxpj"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt; teases a multiversal meltdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="e4wQSN"&gt;It’s not just Marvel dabbling in the multiverse these days: the long-delayed &lt;em&gt;The Flash &lt;/em&gt;is got a sneak peak at FanDome, bringing not just Ezra Miller’s superfast hero, but also the return of both Ben Affleck &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;Michael Keaton’s versions of Batman. Keaton does the voice-over for the teaser which includes a glimpse of the unmistakable Batman cowl at the end. It’s scheduled to hit theaters November 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XeafWx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IT26FpgwnyM?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J5W5Dw"&gt;Early behind the scenes look at Aquaman and Shazam sequels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2cP0Zu"&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shazam!: Fury of the Gods &lt;/em&gt;were quite ready for primetime, but DC did show off some early behind the scenes looks at both sequels, which will continue the adventures of Jason Momoa’s muscle-bound aquatic hero and Zachary Levi / Asher Angel’s Shazam. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QAYTD6dK4s&amp;amp;ab_channel=JoBloMovieTrailers"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Shazam!&lt;/em&gt; sequel teaser&lt;/a&gt; gave a look at Rachel Zegler, Helen Mirren, and Lucy Liu as a set of new villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5AUWad"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TV2op47sKmY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MHtNmE"&gt;A deep dive into &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ej1M8A"&gt;While Rocksteady is off working on its &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; game, Warner Bros. Games Montreal is continuing the Arkham-style adventures in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376323/gotham-knights-fandome-warner-bros-montreal-batman-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which had originally been slated for a 2021 release before getting delayed to 2022. Players will be able to team up as Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood in an open-world action RPG when the game arrives next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wkKPnI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OODneEUWUQY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kQbdQf"&gt;Peacemaker gets a trailer ahead of its HBO Max debut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JQk5Ja"&gt;John Cena’s Peacemaker character — introduced in the summer’s &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; — is getting his own HBO Max show, where he’ll try to bring peace to the world (no matter how much violence it takes.) The first trailer shows that writer and director James Gunn isn’t letting up on the unique blend of violent comedy from the film, and Cena is surprisingly appealing and funny in the teaser. If you’ve ever wanted to see Cena in his tighty-whities, you’re in luck (if not, you’ve been warned). Oh and also he gets a hug from an eagle which is as silly/awesome as it sounds. &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; debuts on HBO Max on January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ybBcsg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DzN99gwJ4I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SbFw2p"&gt;Lots of DC TV show trailers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V1PI54"&gt;Fandome teased new seasons of &lt;em&gt;Batwoman, The Flash, Superman &amp;amp; Lois&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Stargirl, &lt;/em&gt;in addition to the animated &lt;em&gt;Aquaman: King of Atlantis &lt;/em&gt;and fan-favorite &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn. &lt;/em&gt;And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1449465172368629772?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Justice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Titans &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DCDoomPatrol/status/1449442314850488322?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have been renewed for new seasons at HBO Max, as well. The first two episodes of&lt;em&gt; Young Justice’&lt;/em&gt;s new season are already streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaJhvu"&gt;We also got a look at the trailer for a new show on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubLkgZHGGVU&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.TV"&gt;CW from Ava DuVernay: &lt;em&gt;Naomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about a teenager who’s not yet aware of her superheroine status. It stars Kaci Walfall as Naomi and debuts next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BtqDf1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444200/hbo-max-new-animated-batman-superman-shows"&gt;Announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as a noir-ish “reimagining” of the character, the new show comes from JJ. Abrams, Matt Reeves and Bruce Timm. The first trailer showed off the unique art style, but Timm, who worked on&lt;em&gt; Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Batman Beyond&lt;/em&gt;, said the show won’t be in black-and-white, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmtZZR"&gt;“My elevator pitch version of this show is that it’s more &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;than &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series,”  &lt;/em&gt;he said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“In Bruce’s world, in this new iteration, it’s just Batman right now. The Justice League doesn’t exist, there aren’t any other superheroes. It’s Batman. You’re watching this lone figure swimming through the cesspool of Gotham. It’s Batman, alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest trailer for The Batman sees Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight face off against the Riddler </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybWICXQJeF1_XZtNDgWRMhHQ_Yo=/295x0:1603x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70004785/batman2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqft2x_Aa4" target="_blank"&gt;WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amz8gB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; debuted a brand new trailer at DC FanDome on Saturday, showing off the best look yet at Robert Pattinson’s take on the Dark Knight and promising an even darker, grittier version of Gotham’s Caped Crusader than any that have hit film before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14Lqlu"&gt;Set just a few years in Batman’s career as a superhero, &lt;em&gt;The Batman &lt;/em&gt;promises to show not just a look at the early days of Batman but numerous other proto-villains and allies, including Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, Andy Serkis as Alfred, and Colin Farrell as The Penguin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPEvxs"&gt;The new trailer also gives the first real look at Paul Dano’s take on the iconic Batman villain the Riddler, who appears to be going for a far creepier, serial killer-esque style version of the character (as opposed to the campier, trickster that most Riddler adaptations hew towards). “What’s black and blue and dead all over?” we hear him ask. An opening shot in the trailer shows a man we see only from behind sitting at a diner counter drinking a cup of coffee when the cops arrive. He puts his hands up, they slam him on the counter to cuff him and as he’s taken away, we see the unmistakable sign of the Riddler in the foam of the latte he leaves behind: a question mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3zee1"&gt;This latest trailer gives a much different vibe than previous iterations of the Batman saga; it balances light and dark in a way that gives it almost a film noir effect. We don’t learn a lot more about the characters, but we definitely get the sense that this younger Batman hasn’t quite identified as a hero just yet. Take the way he describes the Bat Singal: “Fear is a tool. When that light hits the sky, it’s not just a call. It’s a warning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAAw9s"&gt;Pattinson and co-star Zoe Kravitz, who plays a mysterious Selina Kyle/Catwoman, were joined by director Matt Reeves in a panel discussion before the trailer dropped. Pattinson said this version of the Caped Crusader “really knows what he’s doing when he puts on the cowl. He’s a bit out of control. He hasn’t really defined what Batman is ... he’s becoming this sort of odd creature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmBUlX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;The original trailer for the film&lt;/a&gt; — released over a year ago at 2020’s DC FanDome event — offered only a mere glimpse of the movie, based on the small amount of footage that Reeves was able to film before COVID-19 caused production to shut down in March 2020. Filming was also &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/the-batman-resumes-filming-after-covid-19-shutdown-4055784/"&gt;forced to pause again in September&lt;/a&gt; that year, just a few days after production had started up again when Pattinson tested positive for COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvi293"&gt;It’s been a long road to theaters for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;; the film was originally intended to hit theaters on June 21st but was pushed first to October 1st. It’s now slated to open in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;on March 4th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Instacart shoppers plan Saturday strike over pay and work conditions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Instacart shopper chooses items for a grocery order." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0Ga5m3NGCt19h0zEVRxFzCepXo=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70004175/instacart_shopper_produce.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Instacart shopper chooses items for a grocery order. Some workers plan to strike Saturday in protest of pay and work conditions | Image: Instacart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjLtmn"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/instacart-shoppers-announce-walk-off-3db7f7208ef3"&gt;Instacart shoppers are striking&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, to protest the company’s pay structure and failure to communicate directly with workers.  The Gig Workers Collective (GWC), which represent some of the company’s shoppers, want the Instacart to address five of its policies. The group is calling for Instacart to pay shoppers by order instead of by batch, reintroduce its item commissions, fix fraud issues with its rating system, provide occupational death benefits, and raise the default tip for shoppers on the platform from 5 percent to 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kNzXR"&gt;The group said the company ignored its demands, which led to the decision to walk off the job on Saturday. “Instacart has refused to finally address these fixes that workers have been begging the company for, in discussions both private and public,” the GWC wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQyG8D"&gt;An Instacart spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that the company takes worker feedback “very seriously.” adding that “historically the actions by this group have not resulted in any disruption or impact to our service.” The claims by the Gig Workers Collection “do not reflect the current shopper experience,” the Instacart statement said, adding that the company has “a variety of channels” for engaging with its shoppers to gather feedback. “The reality is that over the last year, shopper sentiment and engagement remain the highest they’ve been in company history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wq3n0U"&gt;As noted by the Instacart statement, Saturday was not the first time the GWC has pushed for a work action among Instacart shoppers. The group organized a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21064108/instacart-workers-organizing-tip-protest-delivery-default"&gt;boycott of Instacart in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; to encourage the company to reinstate the minimum 10 percent tip, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197078/instacart-workers-protest-coronavirus-protections-date-sick-leave"&gt;staged a walk-off in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s lack of sick leave and protections for workers from the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4SHnF"&gt;Following the March 2020 walk-off, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21200348/instacart-strike-coronavirus-no-impact"&gt;Instacart said it had seen “absolutely no impact”&lt;/a&gt; on its business as a result. But a spokesperson for the GWC pointed out that several days after the March walk-out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206630/instacart-health-and-safety-kits-face-mask-hand-sanitizer-sick-pay-strike"&gt;Instacart said it would provide its shoppers&lt;/a&gt; with health and safety kits that included masks and hand sanitizer, two items that were among the workers’ demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uFw7ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instacart’s reported plan to automate its workforce seems a lot like bluster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463023/instacart-plans-automation-grocery-shopping-business-model"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RanXZU"&gt;And, the GWC spokesperson added, the walk-offs are about more than disrupting the company’s operations; it’s hoping to change the narrative around &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-may-delay-ipo-until-121347561.html"&gt;Instacart’s plans to go public later this year&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s been a huge success,” the GWC spokesperson said of its past efforts. “Prior to this, the media stories were about how ‘Instacart’s prepping for an exciting IPO.’ Now, the stories are focused on their exploitative practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7I8kp"&gt;It’s also not totally clear how many of Instacart’s workers the collective represents, but its spokesperson said the company’s claims that the group doesn’t speak for the majority of its shoppers is incorrect. “Instacart knows that we’re speaking for a majority of its shoppers, because they hear about these specific grievances nonstop,” the spokesperson said. “We hope Instacart’s customers are watching how the company handles this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCImJT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue’s Pocket will have an extremely fancy OS to save games to and from cartridges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGgUOmRuAUFVgy7Vf3V4LssHSac=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003715/Hero.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwqIcZ"&gt;There’s still no firm release date for the delayed Analogue Pocket (outside of the broader “December 2021” window that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667465/analogue-pocket-preorders-delay-december-2021"&gt;last provided in September&lt;/a&gt;), but Analogue is looking to whet players’ appetites with the next best thing: a deep look at AnalogueOS, the new custom software that will power the Pocket whenever it does actually arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AG2vK"&gt;As one might expect for a retro gaming device, AnalogueOS features a minimal, pixel-art style design that’s meant to get you into games as easily as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkDgB5Da5zN4ILyLcW6TYw6UgFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930446/2_OS_Hero.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ft66YA"&gt;But Analogue is taking its goal of making the ultimate retro gaming device seriously. There’s a new “Library” feature, with a massive database that the company has built from the ground up with the goal of serving as a comprehensive historical archive for retro gaming. Players will be able to browse around and explore the history of classic games and developers, sorted by region, system, publisher, and more. The Library will also let players pull in box art or title screens for games that they’re playing and even read physical cartridges to identify the exact revision and version of a game. There’s also playlist support, too, for creating custom lists of favorites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wGpdmc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest features won’t be in AnalogueOS 1.0, though&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YO2MEo"&gt;But one of the most interesting features is what Pocket calls “Memories,” which should allow players to capture and load save states directly to and from a cartridge and even share them with other players to load onto &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;cartridges — something the company says has never been done before. Memories will also allow for players to save and share screenshots, too — a staple of modern consoles that it’s looking to bring to older games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nQZ8J"&gt;Lastly, AnalogueOS will offer a variety of tools for tracking gameplay, including logging how long and when you played specific games. AnalogueOS is also meant to be a stepping stone for the company — one that will (eventually) be available for other Analogue products, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoRCv64TPTodbydzCBCLX7aFb_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930447/4_OS_Hero.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iNpuFQ"&gt;And while all that sounds very neat, there are a lot of caveats in Analogue’s announcement here. For example, while the Library, Memories, and Tracking features all sound great, they won’t be available on the initial AnalogueOS 1.0 — rather, they’ll be coming later “on AnalogueOS 1.1 and beyond.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3eu8H"&gt;Additionally, when the Library feature does arrive, it’ll only support Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, Game Boy, and Game Gear games. Neo Geo Pocket Color, Neo Geo Pocket, TurboGrafx-16 and Atari Lynx support will come alongside the cartridge adapters in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jEcyy"&gt;The first Pocket Analogue consoles are expected to ship “at the latest in December.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>International Space Station tilted after thrusters on a Russian craft fired unexpectedly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ISS international space station" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGQeJpjyglkMKEhPveKLHSP9y74=/8x0:4280x2848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003698/STS-133_International_Space_Station_after_undocking_5.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The International Space Station | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nnO0JZ"&gt;The International Space Station was unexpectedly tilted on Friday after a test firing of thrusters on Russia’s Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft continued longer than expected. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/science/international-space-station-russia.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the personnel aboard the ISS were never in danger according to a &lt;a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/22425/"&gt;statement from Russia’s Roscosmos&lt;/a&gt; space agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDlCRO"&gt;Ground teams for NASA and Roscosmos were able to regain control of the station about 30 minutes after it lost positioning control at 5:13AM ET. But it’s the second such incident aboard the ISS within the past year, and it occurred with a craft that is supposed to return to Earth early Sunday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vGMcL"&gt;The incident started when cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky was testing the engines aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, which is docked with the station. A NASA spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the Soyuz thruster firing unexpectedly continued past the time when the engine test was supposed to end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFE8Qy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600306/uncontrolled-firing-from-russian-module-causes-brief-tug-of-war-on-international-space-station"&gt;In July, thrusters on Russia’s Nauka&lt;/a&gt; module fired “uncontrollably,” reorienting the ISS by about 45 degrees. It took about an hour to regain control, and NASA said at the time such incidents were rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fH8QK"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709501/russia-soyuz-launch-actress-producer-filming-movie-space-station"&gt;Russian film crew that went up to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; on October 5th for a movie shoot is supposed to return to Earth early Sunday aboard the Soyuz craft that had the thruster incident on Friday. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that the thruster incident delayed some of the movie’s filming schedule. NASA said the craft is still scheduled to undock from the ISS later on Saturday as planned. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief chat with the fired #AppleToo organizer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z6gH_pldp31MNJbVlt325SjeG60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003556/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uUNI6p"&gt;On October 14th, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to comply with an internal investigation. The employee, Janneke Parrish, has been working behind the scenes for months to organize fellow employees who’ve faced harassment and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mujZpQ"&gt;Now, Apple appears to be cracking down on those efforts — under the guise of trying to stop internal information from leaking to the press. In September, Apple fired Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating her confidentiality agreement. Then, it placed software engineer Cher Scarlett on medical leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQWGW4"&gt;Both Gjøvik and Scarlett have filed claims with the NLRB. Parrish’s lawyer, Vincent P. White of White, Hilferty and Albanese, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Parrish plans to sue for wrongful termination and will also be filing a charge with the NLRB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLOmo5"&gt;Parrish spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about her organizing efforts and the circumstances around her termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hhBFfR"&gt;
&lt;p id="wiYBzL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me what the last few months have been like for you. You started doing internal advocacy with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Antonio García Martínez&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;letter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9xD2s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janneke Parrish:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, and that was the first time I really saw employee activism at Apple having an impact. I was already in the remote work advocacy Slack channel at the time, wanting people to be able to make the best decisions for them in regards to how and where they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoXJkT"&gt;But with the Antonio García Martínez letter, we saw that activism can be effective — that when we speak up, executives might listen. That led to more letters from the remote work group, asking for flexibility in terms of where we work. But we didn’t get the same response this time — the response was essentially, “We think it would be better to be back in the office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOag5Q"&gt;Employee advocacy is incredibly important to help make our voices heard, but there’s a limit to what we can do internally. If you’re speaking to people who don’t want to listen to you, you might as well not be speaking at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I50LGh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you and Cher Scarlett start working together on #AppleToo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga1VAc"&gt;While I was doing this work with remote advocacy, Cher was doing work with pay advocacy. We met through needing to advocate for pay equity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;transitioned it into #AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTnJak"&gt;I led the employee stories component — telling the stories of workers who’ve been abused and discriminated against, who’ve reached out through the channels Apple tells us to and heard nothing. It’s the story of remote advocacy being told on a macro scale across the entire business — that we are consistently unheard and devalued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JwNQWB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple doesn’t need to know how much money I lost on GameStop.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVM59P"&gt;I do not know how somebody looks at hundreds of stories like that and does not take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFBYg2"&gt;So I’ve been doing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxFe7l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the impact been? It seems like you haven’t gotten the same pushback internally as Cher and Ashley.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPwWQ"&gt;I have received a lot of supportive messages, and no, I haven’t gotten as much criticism. I honestly don’t know why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCsT6U"&gt;I’m a program manager. I’m not an engineer, and I’m in a department that doesn’t have the same visibility theirs does. I’m in Maps, and it just doesn’t have the same visibility. I also continue to put myself out of the limelight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E1v2n"&gt;And I’m in Austin, not California. A lot of Apple’s arguments around coming back to the office are very California-centric and don’t apply to people in Texas. They talk about running into people in the halls — I never run into execs in Austin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5Bb3L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did the investigation start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FzVHo"&gt;On September 18th, there was a town hall that was live leaked to you. And afterward, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;Tim Cook sent out a memo&lt;/a&gt; saying we’re disappointed and going to find the leakers. In the wake of that memo, Apple started doing investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYheQe"&gt;On September 30th, I was called into a meeting with HR and global security and told I was being investigated for possibly leaking the meeting. My devices were confiscated, but before they were, I deleted apps with personal information, like Robinhood. Apple doesn’t need to know how much money I lost on GameStop. I work on political campaigns, and Democratic political campaign information has to be kept private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbnYEu"&gt;So before turning in the devices, I removed this information. I was given a loaner and asked to continue working, which I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5p0Sp"&gt;On October 8th, I was reached out to again by global security and HR, and they said I was being suspended and took the loaner devices and deactivated all my internal accounts. I was in mid-conversation with some people, and then my internal accounts immediately showed “deactivated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MSsbqu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C458fa"&gt;Doing this set my work back as well. The very fact that it happened at all — I work in Maps, we work with highly confidential information, and our need to keep stuff secret is vital for our success. So even being investigated, my career on Maps was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdFkzv"&gt;On Thursday, I received a call from global security and HR saying I had been terminated for deleting the files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hvbuT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was that personal information on your work device in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcj7er"&gt;On Maps, we’re encouraged to test out the maps and new features. My particular role was the program manager for tools, so I needed to know our tools behaved correctly. For me, using my work phone as a personal phone gave me a great opportunity to test things in the field, which we are highly encouraged to do. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;Apple encourages us to integrate&lt;/a&gt; [our personal and work devices]. When I was first issued the phone, that seemed perfectly legitimate. But in hindsight, it probably was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydbDee"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your view on why you were fired?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjioA6"&gt;I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out, for my work with #AppleToo, and out of concern that I was organizing to help other employees tell their stories. In my view, this is entirely retaliation for trying to bring Apple’s actions to light and publicly asking the company to do better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBTLRZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is #AppleToo done now that you’ve been fired and Cher is out on medical leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzEsTo"&gt;I absolutely don’t think so. I think seeing that Apple would rather fire an employee for speaking out and asking the company to do better instead of actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; better says volumes about the company and its priorities. I hope people see the decision Apple has made and that it is a galvanizing decision. My goal is to make Apple better for everyone. And it seems like Apple is less interested in that than I am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVGtAb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vwVyz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US has set a date to reopen its borders to vaccinated foreign visitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-CANADA-HEALTH-VIRUS-TRAVEL-TOURISM" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gWPzUJnw6W9V-pvnYoI0npzqe6k=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69999344/1234594574.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The US-Canada border reopened to vaccinated visitors | Photo by Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="stjlW6"&gt;The White House announced Friday that the US is reopening its land and air borders to vaccinated foreign nationals on November 8th. State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a press briefing that details will be available ahead of November 8th for airline passengers and people arriving at US land borders for what they’ll need to show full proof of vaccination against COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlKs6h"&gt;As part of pandemic restrictions, non-essential travelers from more than 30 countries had been barred from entering the US since March 2020. This latest news comes as the White House announced Tuesday that the US was ending restrictions at the borders and ferry crossings with Mexico and Canada for foreign nationals vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Br9ePb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584359/canada-border-reopen-non-essential-travel-us-citizens-vaccinated"&gt;Canada began allowing&lt;/a&gt; vaccinated US visitors into the country for non-essential travel in August. Travelers seeking to enter Canada will be required to fill out a questionnaire using the ArriveCAN app and need to demonstrate a quarantine plan in case they don’t meet Canada’s requirements for quarantine exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2zwaz"&gt;Last month, the White House said the US would end restrictions on air travel from more than 30 countries in early November but didn’t provide a date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSRW1J"&gt;Non-US air travelers will be required to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight and proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. For foreign visitors crossing into the US at a land border, only proof of vaccination will be required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFAVlK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 16th 9:23AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds confirmation from White House and comment from State Department&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqUa0m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="aVPTFI"&gt;NASA’s Lucy space probe launched successfully from Cape Canaveral in Florida early Saturday, the beginning of a 12-year mission to study Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGji5y"&gt;The uncrewed spacecraft lifted off at 5:34AM ET aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Lucy sent its first signal to Earth from its own antenna to NASA’s Deep Space Network at 6:40AM ET.  Scientists believe the Trojan asteroids, which orbit the Sun along the same path as Jupiter, may hold clues about the formation of our solar system. It’s NASA’s first-ever single-spacecraft mission to explore so many different asteroids, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-ula-launch-lucy-mission-to-fossils-of-planet-formation"&gt;agency said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqWn4M"&gt;Lucy is named for the fossilized human skeleton &lt;a href="https://iho.asu.edu/about/lucys-story"&gt;discovered in Ethiopia in 1974&lt;/a&gt;, which provided key insights into human evolution. The fossil got her name from the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” which was &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/inspiration-links-the-beatles-a-fossil-and-a-nasa-mission"&gt;playing at the site&lt;/a&gt; where excavators found her. NASA says Lucy the spacecraft will provide insights into our evolution much the way her fossil counterpart did, only this time on a planetary scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JAMP4U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NASA’s Lucy will explore swarms of asteroids around Jupiter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22711372/nasa-lucy-mission-jupiter-trojan-asteroids-12-years-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V07nOe"&gt;Lucy is on a complicated trajectory that will include three trips back toward Earth for gravity assists. First, Lucy will orbit the Sun and then head back toward Earth next year for a gravity assist. That will accelerate and direct the craft’s trajectory beyond Mars’ orbit, when Lucy will head back toward Earth again for another gravity assist in 2024. This will help propel the craft toward the Donaldjohanson asteroid in 2025; after that Lucy will head toward the Trojan asteroids, arriving in 2027. Then, after four targeted fly-bys, Lucy will head back to Earth for a third gravity assist in 2031, which will propel it toward the Trojans for another encounter in 2033.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mKDPw3"&gt;“We started working on the Lucy mission concept early in 2014, so this launch has been long in the making,” &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/840/hal-levison/"&gt;Hal Levison&lt;/a&gt;, Lucy principal investigator with the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) said in a statement. “It will still be several years before we get to the first Trojan asteroid, but these objects are worth the wait and all the effort because of their immense scientific value. They are like diamonds in the sky.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snag a Samsung soundbar for a low price from Newegg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SNrW9JK95Gjy7Dq2eV3hQky3YQ=/0x54:1280x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003340/86_508_325_S08.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T8xwj2"&gt;This slim soundbar from Samsung is currently available for its lowest price ever at Newegg, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-hw-q60t-za-soundbar%2Fp%2FN82E16886508325%3FItem%3DN82E16886508325%26cm_sp%3DDailydeal_SS-_-86-508-325-_-10152021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $298&lt;/a&gt;. This 38-inch soundbar comes packed with 9 forward-firing speakers and a wireless subwoofer for a soundbar that punches well above its weight. There are a couple of things to keep in mind, however. This soundbar only comes equipped with a single HDMI input and output port, so you’ll need to rely on a switcher, or utilize the built-in Bluetooth connectivity if you’re using this soundbar for multiple devices. Another small drawback is the lack of additional rear-channel speakers, which shouldn’t be an issue for smaller rooms, but if you have a particularly large living room, you may want to invest in a pair of tertiary speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8cMtce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10809472"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SnpWrW"&gt;Amazon’s first-generation Echo Buds are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeNewsletter101521/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/echo-buds-1st-gen-anr-true-wireless-earbuds-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Woot&lt;/a&gt; for their lowest price to date: $40. While many earbuds come equipped with voice assistance enabled, the Amazon Echo Buds are always listening, allowing you to call on Amazon Alexa anywhere, just like you would at home. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price"&gt;our initial review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were by the level of comfort they offer and Bose’s proprietary noise reduction technology, which helps “eliminate annoying hums and cut down on street noise.” There are definitely better-sounding earbuds on the market —  we’ve even highlighted a few in our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; — but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a pair this good for a price this low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iI5qIP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ivwtk"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro is a handy little notebook, and thanks to this deal on Woot, you can &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14464697?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-pro-laptop-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab one for $780 while supplies last&lt;/a&gt;. This lightweight, OLED-equipped laptop is surprisingly powerful and can last for up to 20 hours on a single charge. Under the hood, the Galaxy Book Pro uses an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, making it an excellent multitasker. The 512GB of built-in SSD storage also provides more than enough space for any project you’re working on, and given the laptop weighs a mere 2.3 pounds and measures less than 0.5-inches thick, you won’t have to worry about lugging the 15-inch machine around or slotting it into a crowded backpack. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7DM5zL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oTa79E"&gt;The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is currently down to its lowest price ever at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Stick-HDR-Streaming-Long-range/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfNo3SnKpfE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This lightweight streaming device is remarkably easy to use and is small enough to fit in your pocket. While Roku did recently release a new version, dubbed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku Streaming Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, the last-gen Stick Plus still touts access to all the same streaming services and remains just as easy to use. You just need to plug the Stick into an available HDMI port and provide power using the bundled USB cable, making it a quick way to stream content to any TV in your home (just don’t expect Dolby Vision support). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UM4VtZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0LYWQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is turning 10, and you’re invited to the party. Taking place in New York City on the 22nd and 23rd of October, On The Verge is going to be a celebration of everything we’ve accomplished over the past decade, and we want you to be a part of it.

    <title>Dbrand pulls its PS5 Darkplates from sale after Sony threatens legal action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3znqwwjp1lcp4rpyqtuzvNGrpg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002640/DSCF7516.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P8Au9K"&gt;Earlier this year, Dbrand started selling matte black PS5 side plates that it called Darkplates, and when it did, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;baited Sony&lt;/a&gt; right on the product’s info page to “Go ahead, sue us.” We got our hands on some, and they look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review"&gt;exactly like you expect&lt;/a&gt;, making the sides of your PS5 black instead of white. They even have their own tongue-in-cheek take on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icon microtexture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zovZ0O"&gt;As of Saturday, though, you can’t buy Darkplates anymore, as Dbrand has removed them from sale after (perhaps unsurprisingly) receiving a cease and desist letter from Sony. (If you visit the Darkplates site right now, it just shows &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;a list of news articles&lt;/a&gt;, including ones from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGvP4o"&gt;Dbrand shared the letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which we’ve included at the bottom of the article. Sony raises a few grievances in the letter, including taking issue with how the faceplates “replicate SIE’s [Sony Interactive Entertainment] protected product design” and with Dbrand’s versions of the PlayStation icons. Dbrand says the letter was issued earlier this year but didn’t provide an exact timeline as to when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeILg9"&gt;As part of the letter, Sony asked that Dbrand “promptly and permanently cease and take down all marketing and promotion for and cease all sales worldwide of faceplates featuring the product configuration of SIE’s PS5 faceplates or any similar product configuration, including without limitation all faceplates currently for sale at &lt;a href="http://dbrand.com/"&gt;dbrand.com&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhxjVA"&gt;Dbrand does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; appear to be agreeing to comply with a permanent cease and desist, though. It says it will comply &lt;em&gt;for now&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbpPzY"&gt;Or more specifically: “We’ve elected to submit to the terrorists’ demands… for now,” Dbrand writes &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/q94jua/darkplates_are_dead_thanks_sony/"&gt;in this 1,666-word post&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s subreddit, one packed with harsh words for Sony and even a few F-bombs. The company signs off with “talk soon,” suggesting it has already has other plans. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2SMzZQ-TcYG86ygoqiF9I0zka4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22931302/57d43zxbhpt71.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dbrand has an enjoyable bit of whataboutism trying to shift the blame on popular Netflix show &lt;/em&gt;Squid Game&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ikiJYl"&gt;This isn’t the first time Sony has threatened legal action over PS5 side plates. One company that started life as PlateStation5 changed its name to CustomizeMyPlates and then canceled and refunded orders, allegedly after Sony threatened legal action, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-faceplate-seller-is-now-cancelling-all-orders-following-legal-action-from-sony/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in November. That company returned in January and is &lt;a href="https://www.customizemyplates.com/"&gt;selling its custom plates again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVTRaM"&gt;Part of the reason that there is a market for side plates is likely because it’s not too hard to take them off a PS5. In fact, Sony shows exactly &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/CaAY-jAjm0w?t=118"&gt;how you can do it&lt;/a&gt; in its official teardown of the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z4rYhF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaAY-jAjm0w?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=118&amp;amp;start=118" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvxiwv"&gt;The ease with which you can take the PS5’s plates off not only makes it easy to get to the inner workings of the console but could also hint that it plans to release other versions of the side plates in the future. You can now buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;red and black DualSense controllers&lt;/a&gt; and a black Pulse 3D Audio headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675347/sony-pulse-3d-audio-headset-wireless-gaming-midnight-black-color-release-date"&gt;is on the way&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Sony is at least experimenting with other color combinations for its accessories, so an official set of black side plates doesn’t feel out of the realm of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32QsQR"&gt;If you don’t want to wait for Sony, though, you have one less option of third-party side plates to pick from while Dbrand’s are off the market. &lt;/p&gt;
