    <title>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is getting a remake for the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDtQWprp353bLSmJPxSpXior-Yk=/189x0:2238x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836455/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_4.06.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kqGWUl"&gt;The legendary &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; roleplaying game &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/09/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-the-legendary-tale-remade-on-playstation-5/"&gt;is getting a PS5 remake&lt;/a&gt;, Sony announced today at its 2021 fall showcase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoKnz4"&gt;The remake is being developed by Aspyr, which had previously worked on the Mac, Android, and iOS ports of both the original &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&lt;/em&gt;. Sony Interactive Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games will also be working on the remake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2RuSy"&gt;Missing from the announcement is BioWare — which originally developed &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; in 2003 — but doesn’t seem to be involved in the new version, although Sony’s announcement post does note that Aspyr has recruited some of the original development team to work on the remake.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UgYJKBafS6V2xJNNlzMBAPGyO8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837963/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_4.06.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iP8GVP"&gt;Set thousands of years before the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films, &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic &lt;/em&gt;(or &lt;em&gt;KOTOR&lt;/em&gt;, as its known by fans) is considered one of the greatest &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; games ever made, pitting players against the villainous Darth Revan and his Sith Empire. The original game was followed by a sequel (developed by Obsidian Entertainment) and the long-running &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; MMO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y23OIE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake&lt;/em&gt; will be a console exclusive for the PlayStation 5 when it launches, although there’s no details yet on a release window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyccgw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 9th, 4:25pm:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added details on launch exclusivity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch exec takes over secretive car project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glD8qhJRzYoj4Ep5u5PO-wfaL5o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836415/acstro_190902_apple_event_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svd8NW"&gt;Just two days after Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661291/apple-car-chief-ford-doug-field"&gt;hired away Doug Field, the head of Apple’s secretive car project&lt;/a&gt;, the tech giant has tapped Apple Watch exec and former Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch to take his place, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/apple-s-watch-software-chief-takes-over-self-driving-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4s1eN"&gt;It’s the latest changing of the guard for the project, known as Project Titan, which has rotated leaders about as much as it has reportedly shifted focus. To wit, Korea’s &lt;em&gt;Maeil Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/apple-chose-to-develop-apple-car-alone/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier Thursday that Apple may no longer be trying to work with other automakers to bring its autonomous electric car to life. Rather, the report states, Apple now plans to go it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tpGcU"&gt;Lynch started working on the project in July, when he was brought on to help develop the vehicle’s software. He joined Apple in 2013 from Adobe, where he was the company’s chief technology officer. While there, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4124972/adobe-cto-kevin-lynch-allegedly-leaving-to-join-apples-ranks"&gt;he somewhat famously wrote Adobe’s official response&lt;/a&gt; to Apple’s decision to keep Flash out of iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="armIzd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lynch wrote Adobe’s defense of putting Flash on ios, once upon a time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHNbMM"&gt;Curiously, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;writes that Lynch still reports to Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams and not John Giannandrea, the company’s head of AI — who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;was tapped last year to oversee the car project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gsfmvh"&gt;Field, meanwhile, ran Project Titan from 2018 up until this week when he was poached by Ford. Before that, he spent years at Tesla helping bring cars like the Model 3 to market. (Before that, he worked at... Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKqP82"&gt;Launched in 2014 as a reported effort to build an electric car, Apple eventually pivoted the project to focus on the self-driving technology stack. But recently, it seems to have pivoted back, striking up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;conversations with major Asian automakers along the way&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;considering buying electric vehicle startup Canoo&lt;/a&gt;). At this point, though, it might as well exist in a quantum state to anyone not actually working on the project. Until it’s observed, the Apple Car is both everything and nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This NVMe SD card is literally too hot to handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jw1WRPp4ZX5j-o2UAgQkRe_i8pw=/0x5:1108x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836337/anandtech_sd_express_card_too_hot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16938/silicon-motion-sm2708-sd-express-review-nvme-ssd-served-hot" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34QXSL"&gt;When we say a gadget has “blazing-fast speeds,” we don’t mean it literally. But &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16938/silicon-motion-sm2708-sd-express-review-nvme-ssd-served-hot"&gt;when &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; benched&lt;/a&gt; one of the first NVMe-based SD card reference designs, it found the tiny plastic-covered rectangle hitting skin-searing temperatures of 96 degrees Celsius (roughly 205 degrees F). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPVenU"&gt;Last year, we wrote how this next wave of SD cards — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264389/new-sd-express-card-specification-four-times-faster"&gt;SD Express&lt;/a&gt; — might quadruple their theoretical speed to nearly four gigabytes per second, by using the PCI-Express and NVMe interfaces more commonly found in the SSD in your computer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;or next-gen game console&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ICxskW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Theoretical speeds are theoretical, but this is still fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRb149"&gt;We haven’t quite hit those speeds yet, anyhow: the specific card &lt;em&gt;AnandTech &lt;/em&gt;tested topped out at around 900MB/s writes and 400MB/s reads in raw sequential tests, and less in normal use. Besides, the Silicon Motion SM2708 controller is aimed at PCIe Gen 3x1 and PCIe Gen 3x2 for maximum speeds of around 985MB/s and 1,97MB/s, respectively, not the nearly 4GB/s speeds that a future controller might deliver with Gen 4x2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJhIoe"&gt;That’s still faster than today’s SD cards, though, whose UHS-II variety tops out at around 300MB/s reads and very slightly slower writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PoZaX"&gt;But those speeds may be beside the point if the card’s emitting tremendous amounts of heat inside your computer or camera. Hopefully that won’t be true of other cards (or other controllers, at least). For what it’s worth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22545402/sony-alpha-1-a1-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price-features-test"&gt;high-end cameras&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515666/nikon-z6-z7-ii-features-specs-price-4k-60fps"&gt;begun&lt;/a&gt; to standardize on the rival CFexpress format, which already claims gigabyte-plus reads and writes — though some users complain that &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cfexpress+heat+site:www.dpreview.com&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS968US968&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjl5u7R0fLyAhX-IzQIHVdvDhYQrQIoBHoECAcQBQ&amp;amp;biw=1024&amp;amp;bih=604"&gt;they get a little toasty&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cFji7"&gt;For now, you don’t have to worry about it: manufacturers are still working on their SD Express cards and readers. Last we checked, you can’t find them on shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche’s new Mission R electric concept racecar is built to stream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTeQIfgz7nawBW2YRsiUe7A-m0I=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836221/MicrosoftTeams_image__4_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Porsche AG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GILyW2"&gt;Porsche is taking inspiration from the world of esports and livestreaming for its next racecar concept. The all-electric Porsche Mission R, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/motorsports/porsche-concept-study-motorsport-world-premiere-iaa-mobility-2021-munich-25584.html"&gt;first introduced&lt;/a&gt; at this weeks’ 2021 IAA Mobility conference in Munich, is what Porsche believes is “the future of customer motorsport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmOQC7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.porsche.com/stories/innovation/a-peek-into-the-future-porsche-racing-experience?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_campaign=int_2021-09-06_porsche_mission_r&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_term=facebook_feed&amp;amp;utm_content=article"&gt;According to Porsche&lt;/a&gt;, the Mission R is designed to create “new ways for fans and driver to interact.” The car features a mostly glass roof — reminiscent of consumer EVs like the Tesla Model 3 or Porsche’s own Taycan — so the driver can be viewed from above during the entirety of race. Inside there are mounted cameras for the driver’s helmet, a movable camera on the car’s A-pillar, and a backward-facing dashboard cam so fans can get up close and personal. Porsche claims the gaming rig-inspired steering wheel has built-in biometric sensors to track a driver’s vitals throughout, and the car also features a dedicated “Livestream button.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dNBm5B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 42.5%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/601015947?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RqrP7S"&gt;Porsche says the Mission R can go from zero to 100 km/h (around 62mph) in 2.5 seconds, with a max speed of over 300 km/h (around 186mph) thanks to an electric motor. It also has up to 320kW of power in the front axle and one with a maximum of 480kW of power in the rear. That’s equivalent to the same lap time performance as the Porsche 911 GT3 Cup, according to the automaker. The Mission R’s 80kWh battery — provided you have the right charger — also seems impressive, with 900 volt charging from 5 percent to 80 percent capacity in 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ooaKh2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10743599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sHWQsX"&gt;As a subsidiary of the larger Volkswagen Group, Porsche is participating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;in the company’s push for electrification&lt;/a&gt; across the board. The Mission R is the high-end professional side of efforts that started with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;the Taycan in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It might not ever officially hit the racetrack, but it’s an interesting acknowledgment of the weird ways gaming and racing intermingle. When races were canceled due to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/22/21184192/sim-racing-coronavirus-f1-nascar-iracing-veloce-esports-max-verstappen-lando-norris"&gt;virtual races filled the hole&lt;/a&gt;, with the very same drivers. The Mission R is just video game livestreaming filtering back in the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAmB6V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz’s Maybach EV concept helps the rich feel even better about themselves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrKC1oGK2-SZquwrJ720qRMfk3o=/0x0:861x574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836192/03_concept_mercedes_maybach_eqs_2560x1640.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xMUtHe"&gt;Mercedes-Benz has shown off the &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/vehicles/passenger-cars/mercedes-maybach/premiere-of-the-concept-mercedes-maybach-eqs/"&gt;electric Maybach EQS&lt;/a&gt;, an opulent concept car that the company says is a preview of what the future of high-end electric cars may look like. The company revealed the EV SUV at the IAA Mobility show, where it also announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/5/22657738/mercedes-benz-eqg-concept-g-class-suv-electric-iaa-mobility"&gt;G-Class SUV&lt;/a&gt; concept, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/5/22657836/the-mercedes-benz-eqe-is-a-more-approachable-luxury-electric-car"&gt;more attainable electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08gtrC"&gt;When compared to the existing &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/vehicles/passenger-cars/mercedes-maybach/the-new-mercedes-maybach-gls/"&gt;Maybach GLS&lt;/a&gt;, the EQS concept doesn’t look particularly outlandish. Mercedes says that the one-off vehicle is based on its modular electric architecture — the same that powers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;its upcoming EQS sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that the concept is meant to show off its vision for “a locally emission-free future,” without giving up the exclusivity and luxury that the Maybach name implies — Mercedes says the interior is supposed to remind you of a yacht, and the SUV has something called a “Chauffeur package.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Xm60l6XKmfFe1kEEvobP0e0daU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837575/04_concept_mercedes_maybach_eqs_2560x1440.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Maybach EQS doesn’t scream “concept,” or even “EV.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sAC0o3"&gt;For the ultra-luxury segment Maybachs exist in, it wouldn’t hurt for a more ecologically friendly option to exist in the world. The gas-powered Maybach GLS has a thirsty 4L V8, which gets 15 MPG in the city and 19 on the highway, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmercedes-benz%2Fmaybach-gls%2F2021%2Fmpg%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664950%2Fmercedes-maybach-eqs-electric-suv-concept-future-luxury" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Edmunds&lt;/a&gt;. Rolls-Royce’s &lt;a href="https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en_US/showroom/cullinan.html"&gt;Cullinan SUV&lt;/a&gt; is even worse, with a 6.75L V12 (twelve!!), &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Frolls-royce%2Fcullinan%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664950%2Fmercedes-maybach-eqs-electric-suv-concept-future-luxury" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly getting&lt;/a&gt; 12 (twelve!!!) MPG in the city (but 20 on the highway). While EVs obviously aren't going to put a huge dent in the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/1/16718844/green-consumers-climate-change"&gt;outsized carbon emissions of the wealthy&lt;/a&gt;, they probably wouldn’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnQlYZ"&gt;Of course, going green can’t come at the cost of feeling better than everyone around you. Mercedes’ page for the concept car contains some incredible prose describing the Maybach EQS: its silhouette is “dynamic,” its design “seamless.” Thankfully, to go along with the EV environmental friendliness theme, the carpet is “faux fur,” instead of the real deal. That’s all sort of the point, though — Maybach is a capital-L Luxury brand, so any concept has to have an aura of prestige around it. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The concept still includes the appearance of a grille, despite not needing one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q3fZZx"&gt;Oh, and the headlights are surrounded by Maybach logos, because concept cars aren’t for subtlety. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsNPlUz0HGu7rqWvYsw5FsLN4wc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837363/09_concept_mercedes_maybach_eqs_2560x1280.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mercedes-Benz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, it does actually look cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NR8mj7"&gt;There are, of course, already luxury electric cars that you can actually buy. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848460/porsche-taycan-electric-sports-car-turbo-price-specs-mile-range-reveal"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes EQS&lt;/a&gt; come to mind, but those types of cars have... let’s call it a different role, culturally speaking. They’re the types of cars you’d drive, whereas Maybachs are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTm6b6mQTIQ"&gt;the types of cars you’re driven in&lt;/a&gt; (and not by an automated system, like the future Tesla is promising). If you’re cross-shopping a Maybach, your other options &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_6SAsypMNM"&gt;may be more Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt; than, say, Tesla whose build quality can sometimes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1434936396096028674?s=20"&gt;miss the “luxury” mark by a mile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q4BmfZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You don’t drive a Maybach, you’re driven in a Maybach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RaW6Vv"&gt;Again, though, the Maybach EQS is only a concept, so it may be quite a while before you (yes, you, the people who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/27/21723138/samsung-98-inch-tv-deal-sale-black-friday-8k"&gt;bought the $50,000 TV on Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;) can get your hands on one. While it’s an outlandish vehicle from the perspective of everyday drivers, it’s not the type of concept that you’d look at and think “Yeah, maybe in a million years,” like Mercedes’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054573/mercedes-benz-avtr-avatar-vision-concept-car-photos-daimler-ces-2020"&gt;Avatar car&lt;/a&gt; from last year. Mercedes calls the concept “a clear preview of the first fully electric series-production model” in the Maybach line, and the company already has an EV platform kicking around that it could put to use. It’s not a subtle car, so I’m sure it won’t be hard to miss when something like it eventually hits the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe6Z01"&gt;Oh, and I almost forgot: as with many concept cars, there’s a completely inscrutable “film” to go with it. Honestly, the butterflies are a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic is shutting down Houseparty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_0RSALuSs1QxGcL3hBUQlaII7o=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836102/stream_fortnite_gameplay_to_houseparty_1280x720_224cb65f8d7c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Houseparty’s &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt; mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SfgGKy"&gt;Epic Games is going to shut down group video chat app Houseparty, the company announced Thursday. The Houseparty app will be removed from app stores “immediately,” according to Epic, though people who already have the app will be able to use it until the service is fully shut down in October. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368345/epic-fortnite-houseparty-gameplay-streaming-app-video-chat-integration"&gt;Houseparty’s integration with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will also continue to work until Houseparty is shut down in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkzNkK"&gt;Houseparty, which was released by the creators of the popular Meerkat livestreaming app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/28/13081014/meerkat-houseparty-video-app"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, was purchased by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;Epic in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic says that “tens of millions of people” have used the app. Going forward, however, “the team behind Houseparty is working on creating new ways to have meaningful and authentic social interactions at metaverse scale across the Epic Games family,” Epic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnVvCr"&gt;That seems to indicate that Epic has more social features in the works for games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; that the Houseparty team will be contributing to, which could be important tools to keep gamers playing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22653797/fortnite-season-7-finale-live-event-date-operation-sky-fire"&gt;ever&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616779/rocket-league-season-4-cowboy-theme-tournament-updates-psyonix"&gt;updating&lt;/a&gt; games. But for those who used Houseparty to chat with their friends and family, the impending shutdown means they’ll have to move those conversations to another messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eunOOJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mad Max: Fury Road’s iconic fleet of post-apocalyptic War Rigs are up for auction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mad Max Fury Road" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jj7OODwtdN_MC_szO7I8m-O8TyE=/1x0:1599x1065/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836032/FRD-DS-00253.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q7adPC"&gt;Over a dozen vehicles from the 2015 cult classic &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road &lt;/em&gt;are being put up for a virtual auction. The vehicles will be available for bidding in a series of auctions held by &lt;a href="https://www.lloydsonline.com.au/AuctionDetails.aspx?aid=25652"&gt;Lloyds&lt;/a&gt; on September 25th-26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgXR1o"&gt;Reading through the descriptions of each vehicle — and hats off to the auctioneers, they really did a commendable job describing each lot — really made me want to fire up George Miller’s blood-and-sand-drenched movie for another watch. WITNESS ME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ncY8ge"&gt;Blown, super-turbo charged and armed to the teeth with weaponry and War Boys, the machines that outran the end of civilisation have been unearthed in the greatest barn-find ever recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQwYk1"&gt;Nitrous, noxious, and no-nonsense harbingers of hell, marking man’s uncanny ability to wring beauty even from that designed for death and destruction, art from power, meaning from machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gZlZsf"&gt;Imagine going for a grocery run in the War Rig that was driven by Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa. Or picking up your kids from school in the Nux Wagon, the super-turbocharged, nitrous-boosted Deuce Coupe driven by Nicholas Hoult’s chrome-lipped true believer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GS0M4P"&gt;Personally, I may put in a bid for the Doof Wagon, the speaker-staked “morale machine” of Immortan Joe’s army of War Boys, intended to rally the troops and keep them pumped up for battle. As the film’s production designer said, “Every army needs a Little Drummer Boy.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Joe’s army had the Doof Warrior, a blind, bungee-attached psychopath who wielded a fire-breathing guitar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJOS4Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtjGTrVwRr4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PG0EjT"&gt;(Unrelated to the auction, I was today years old when I learned that the Doof Warrior’s mask was made from the dried skin of his murdered mother’s screaming face, and now I probably won’t sleep for a week.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7doHI4"&gt;If you live in Australia and need to inspect any of the vehicles before putting in a bid, an appointment can be made through Lloyds. The auction will also be livestreamed, so tune in if you want to see who gets what. No base prices have been set as of the publication of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYrbwS"&gt;Here’s a full list of the available vehicles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="X6DtSz"&gt;The War Rig: Prime Mover Inc. tanker and ball pig-trailer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="K9y56y"&gt;The Gigahorse: W16 Cadillac pair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GivGnb"&gt;The Doof Wagon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PEDlTZ"&gt;Nux Car: 1932 three-window Chev Coupe, V8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pn33ly"&gt;Convoy Car: Elvis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RADEAR"&gt;Convoy Car: Jag Flamer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YU94Su"&gt;Razor Cola: 1973 XB Falcon Coupe (The Interceptor reborn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SivxGg"&gt;Pole Car: Pontiac Surfari with 20’ pole counterweight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="95RBGT"&gt;Sabre Tooth: F250 Claw Car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oaIaLA"&gt;Fire Car: Dodge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8R8TLx"&gt;Caltrop: El Dorado&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AE0UDs"&gt;Buggy: Ratrod Chev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LbJkZN"&gt;Buick: heavy artillery with Hummer weapon mount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Amazon, fighting SpaceX’s Starlink plans, says Elon Musk’s companies don’t care about rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Founder Jeff Bezos Makes Announcement At Satellite 2019 Conference In DC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GtrGZ3Aj1L7iYscg86KAHmATWSc=/0x0:3249x2166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835766/1148068855.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mark Wilson / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2h7ABW"&gt;Amazon slammed Elon Musk’s SpaceX as a serial rule-breaker on Wednesday amid an enduring fight over the two companies’ plans to build rivaling satellite networks. The conflict, waged within lengthy filings to the Federal Communications Commission, is nothing new. But this time, Amazon sent FCC officials a laundry list of Musk’s past troubles with other regulators, mounting its most aggressive attempt yet to push back on SpaceX’s speedy timeline for deploying its broadband satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDxMiI"&gt;“Try to hold a Musk-led company to flight rules? You’re ‘fundamentally broken,’” Amazon wrote in its filing, referring to the time Musk complained that the Federal Aviation Administration’s regulatory structure slowed down SpaceX’s operations. “Try to hold a Musk-led company to health and safety rules? You’re ‘unelected &amp;amp; ignorant,’” it added, referring to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259159878427267072?s=20"&gt;Musk’s beef with officials&lt;/a&gt; who sought to keep factories closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7bTaK"&gt;This particular fight — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;there have been many&lt;/a&gt; — goes back to earlier this year when SpaceX proposed an update to its Starlink network, a vast constellation of satellites in low-Earth orbit designed to beam broadband internet to rural areas with little to no internet connections. SpaceX has over 1,700 satellites in orbit so far, with about 100,000 customers using its internet services in a beta phase. Amazon is planning a similar satellite network called Kuiper with more than 3,000 satellites, but it hasn’t revealed production plans or launched any satellites to space yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from pad 40 at the Cape..." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJbNMcaLnb4SdxcbGyIdv3JjJBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22648855/1233127360.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX launches its most recent dedicated Starlink mission on May 26th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Upl5re"&gt;Last month, SpaceX filed a request to tweak its proposal to the FCC, asking the commission to approve two plans for deploying Starlink satellites in the future. SpaceX, its filing said, would only implement one of the two plans, mainly hinging its decision on how quickly its next generation of Starlink satellites will be ready for launch and when its Starship rocket would be ready to start launching those Starlink satellites. Since 2019, SpaceX has used its Falcon 9 rockets to launch dozens of dedicated Starlink satellite missions to space. But Starship, a much bigger rocket that’s still under development, would more quickly send satellites in their target orbit, SpaceX says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dovg4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon: reviewing SpaceX’s plans would “require significant effort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2UdotA"&gt;Amazon called foul days later, saying SpaceX’s strategy to propose two mutually exclusive plans runs afoul of precedent and “requires significant effort” for the FCC and other companies to scrutinize. SpaceX wasn’t buying it. “Amazon strains credulity by suggesting it lacks the resources to analyze SpaceX’s application, especially considering Amazon routinely brings as many as six lobbyists and lawyers to its many meetings with the Commission about SpaceX,” SpaceX shot back in another filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6X2f8"&gt;Amazon, in its latest filing, acknowledged it’s “well positioned” to evaluate the proposals but added that “this burden may weigh more heavily” on the other companies that commented on SpaceX’s plan. Companies are allotted time to analyze and oppose other companies’ proposed plans in case there’s a chance it interferes with their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5mLTI"&gt;SpaceX’s rapid development pace of new technologies — supercharged by funding from Musk and lofty investment rounds — often moves faster than government agencies are able to regulate them, creating all sorts of trouble and drama and, sometimes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;direct violations&lt;/a&gt;. Proposing two tentative plans for the FCC to review, while unconventional, is a bid to get the FCC on board with SpaceX’s speedy development ethic, which is defined by the company’s heavily boasted “iterative approach”: deploy the things first, get them in orbit, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; plan gradual updates — or iterations — to weed out inefficiencies in the next satellites’ design. SpaceX started launching the first iteration of some 30,000 planned Starlink satellites in 2019 and has over 1,700 currently in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKb3R8"&gt;Now, SpaceX wants to deploy an upgraded generation of satellites, built bigger and with added capabilities like laser links, which waive the need for ground stations by allowing the satellites to talk to each other and relay communications in orbit as they pass over user areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="62JKVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starlink’s sales boss: iteration is “what keeps people engaged”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eFwFSv"&gt;This production strategy is somewhat akin to SpaceX’s development with Starship: launch the thing first, work out any errors or design inefficiencies that pop up along the way, make design changes, launch again, rinse and repeat. In SpaceX’s rocket world, the iterative approach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22352366/elon-musk-spacex-faa-warnings-starship-sn8-launch-violation-texas"&gt;pissed off regulators&lt;/a&gt;. And in the satellite world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;it’s pissing off SpaceX’s competitors&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX has largely moved ahead regardless of those obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zHV82"&gt;“On the iteration side of things, that’s what keep people engaged,” Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX’s vice president of commercial Starlink sales, said on Wednesday. “With Starlink we’re certainly capitalizing on it, and we challenge everybody else to capitalize on it,” he said, adding that “the conventional way of doing satellites just takes too long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZOm7p"&gt;“People come to SpaceX… because they see action,” Hofeller said. “That’s how you get people engaged in what you’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the largest direct air capture plant will suck CO2 out of the atmosphere  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World’s Largest Carbon-Sucking Plant Starts Making Tiny Dent in Emissions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rz3W2DhLqGn9t1J9BDe-4FpH8s8=/0x85:4000x2752/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835577/1235138610.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The ‘Orca’ direct air capture and storage facility, operated by Climeworks AG, in Hellisheidi, Iceland, on Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Arnaldur Halldorsson/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RPftzT"&gt;The biggest industrial plant yet to suck tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide out of the air came online yesterday in southwest Iceland. &lt;a href="https://atmos.earth/carbon-capture-removal-environmental-justice/"&gt;Direct air capture&lt;/a&gt; plants like this one have been hyped up lately by world leaders and giant corporations — notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; — that are looking to erase their legacy of greenhouse gas pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhH129"&gt;This particular operation is ideally located to test the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;emerging technology. The new plant, built by Swiss company Climeworks, is powered by renewable energy from a geothermal power plant nearby. Climeworks also plans to lock the captured CO2 away in basalt rock formations just three kilometers from the geothermal plant. It’s a storage plan that likely bypasses the need for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;controversial new carbon dioxide pipelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgaH6A"&gt;“It’s going to be, I think, an interesting test case,” says David Morrow, director of research at the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University. “But it’s also sort of a baby step in the big scheme of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6mv1ko"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A baby step in the big scheme of things”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgsD0d"&gt;Climeworks’ new direct air capture plant, called Orca for the Icelandic word for energy, will be able to draw down 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. That’s about how much 790 passenger vehicles might pump out in a year — not a huge amount, even though it’s the largest operation of its kind in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wAsHm"&gt;The new plant is surprisingly compact. Imagine a shipping container that’s open on one side to reveal twelve giant fans. The plant is basically just eight of those containers, stacked two by two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aX8HlD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nLBGM0kZmE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="41sQYX"&gt;Climeworks uses a method&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;called solid direct air capture to trap CO2. Here’s how it works: The fans suck in air. The air passes over a special solid sorbent filter that traps the carbon dioxide. Climeworks wouldn’t get into too much detail about how its filters work in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, other than saying that it uses a base to attract CO2, which is mildly acidic. When the filter is fully saturated, it’s time for step two in the process. The unit heats up the filter to about 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), which releases the trapped carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUJKxA"&gt;Once the CO2 has been separated out of the air, it heads through pipes to an adjacent building where it can be prepped to be permanently stored. Here, it’s mixed with a lot of water — about 27 tons of water for every ton of carbon dioxide. That slurry then travels just a few hundred meters (about a quarter of a mile) away before it is injected deep into the ground. The carbonated water reacts with basaltic rock, creating carbonate minerals. Over the course of two years, what was once a kind of sparkling water becomes solid rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEv5wr"&gt;Climeworks has partnered with the company Carbfix to keep the captured CO2 safely locked away in Iceland’s basalt rock formations. The two companies have already tried this out in a pilot project, but Orca is the pair’s first commercial-scale operation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CR51JBmS02tQpWIo0r9NPJKc6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836822/ada4e9dd_a5e0_40c6_8ecd_038ac83e17f3_Orca_Launch_Website_Image.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Climeworks’ Orca direct air capture plant in Hellisheidi, Iceland.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8ArL8A"&gt;Climeworks’ two other commercial-scale direct air capture plants turn the carbon dioxide into a product used as fertilizer or in fizzy drinks. That CO2 escapes back into the atmosphere relatively quickly. But trapped in rock, Carbfix thinks the CO2 captured by Orca can be safely sequestered for thousands of years. While basaltic rock is relatively common around the world, volcanically active&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Iceland is particularly suited for storing carbon dioxide because it has relatively younger basalt. Fresh basalt is a better home for the captured CO2 because it’s more porous — giving the carbon more nooks and crannies to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wNSbL"&gt;By siting Orca in the same remote location where the CO2 will be stored, the operation avoids one of the potential pitfalls with carbon removal: creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;a new network of pipelines&lt;/a&gt; to transport captured carbon dioxide. There are already some pipelines that move CO2 so that it can be shot into the ground to force out oil reserves, a process called enhanced oil recovery. One such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642806/co2-pipeline-explosion-satartia-mississippi-carbon-capture"&gt;pipeline ruptured&lt;/a&gt; last year in Mississippi, hospitalizing residents of a small, majority-Black community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8csOd"&gt;The other advantage of the plant’s location is its proximity to a geothermal energy plant, which provides the plant with a constant supply of waste heat and renewable energy. That, paired with Climeworks’ solid direct air capture process, gives Orca an edge over other competitors. Even larger direct air capture plants are scheduled to come online in Texas and Scotland in coming years, but those use a different filtration process that requires vastly more heat and energy. As a result, they’ll likely rely on a combination of renewable energy and natural gas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s1jEL"&gt;“If you’re in the business of removing CO2 from the air, you want to emit as little fossil fuel CO2 as possible. Otherwise, the process is not net negative or net removing,” says Christoph Beuttler, Climeworks’ head of climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J5MXoV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cost is another hurdle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoy4Wf"&gt;Cost is another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/19/9174589/climate-change-carbon-removal-capture-air"&gt;hurdle&lt;/a&gt; still keeping the direct air capture industry from growing large enough to make a huge dent in global greenhouse gas emissions. Microsoft, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068799/microsoft-carbon-capture-climate-change"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; last year to capture all of its historical emissions by 2050, is both an investor and a customer of Climeworks. Microsoft and other companies can purchase captured CO2 from Climeworks for around $600 a ton, offsetting a ton of their own pollution in the process. In its 2020 fiscal year alone, Microsoft was responsible for the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;11,164,000 metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of carbon dioxide. Multiply that by $600, and Microsoft would face a bill of nearly $6.7 billion for just one year’s worth of pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xklAYy"&gt;Unless the price can come down significantly, it might not make much financial sense to tackle climate change this way. And some environmentalists worry that focusing on building up this technology could take resources away from other climate solutions, while taking the pressure off companies to quit burning fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0b1cX9"&gt;“One thing people worry about is that all these companies making that net-zero pledges will just use direct air capture instead of cutting emissions,” Morrow says. “But it strikes me as very unlikely that direct air capture would get cheap enough anytime soon for that to make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZXSRe"&gt;So while direct air capture might play a small role in helping the world trap some planet-heating emissions, it’s no replacement for deep cuts to fossil fuel pollution in the first place. “It is at most a supplement that can help us reduce climate change,” Morrow says. “But it can’t take the place of cutting emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8y5kTP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzrjaZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5RKur"&gt;YouTube is cutting the number of subscribers you need to be able to make Community posts in half, &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d1b233e4-4ac2-41a0-abbb-8c3db9665bc8"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Starting October 12th, instead of requiring 1,000 subscribers, you’ll need more than 500 subscribers. In a tweet, YouTube said that will open up the feature to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057"&gt;“millions” more channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oFScVw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Community posts are coming to millions more channels!!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Starting October 12, 2021, we’re lowering the eligibility threshold for Community posts to channels with 500+ subscribers: &lt;a href="https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML"&gt;https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tips for getting started on the Community tab →&lt;a href="https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t"&gt;https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SB1pyfbgUz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SB1pyfbgUz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pl2oeK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9409631?hl=en"&gt;Community posts&lt;/a&gt; are Facebook-like news or status updates from creators that can be found on a dedicated Community tab on their profile. Sometimes, you might also see them in the Home or Subscriptions tab. The feature was designed to replace the Discussion tab, which will be officially removed from all channels on October 12th, YouTube said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojwkra"&gt;For creators with fewer than 500 subscribers who want to use the Community posts feature, YouTube says it is “working to bring Community posts to you in the future,” suggesting that the feature could be rolled out more widely at some point. And once you do cross that 500-subscriber threshold, it might take up to a week until you can make Community posts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
