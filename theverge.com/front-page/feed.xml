    <title>How Samsung beefed up its new folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Are the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 strong enough for everybody?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="biWujD"&gt;I was not expecting Samsung’s third generation of folding phones to be water-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz0Uv6"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; have just as many moving parts as previous generations. Phones have been resistant to spills and short dunks for some time, but folding phones add an entirely new level of complication to waterproofing. There are many more ways for water to get in, and some of those ingress points move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzlpM2"&gt;Samsung’s solutions for sealing up those ports are clever, but they’re above and beyond what Samsung’s folding phones really needed: stronger screens. Samsung says that’s happening, too. In fact, in a call with some of Samsung’s lead engineers, I learned why the company believes these phones are sturdy enough to become mainstream devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8mqKzp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 preview: there’s just something about this phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381267"},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"},{"title":"The Galaxy Watch 4 injects Samsung’s capable hardware with Google software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"},{"title":"How to preorder the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22381610"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JNQqlK"&gt;Samsung has had its share of very public embarrassments. That first Galaxy Fold was canceled before launch because review units broke — sometimes spontaneously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;as mine did&lt;/a&gt;. And of course, there was the fall of 2016 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13202608/samsung-galaxy-note-7-discontinued"&gt;Galaxy Note 7 batteries caught fire around the world&lt;/a&gt;, seriously threatening people’s safety and leading to a recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnM6tY"&gt;But the Fold was eventually released after some changes, and more changes still have been applied to this new generation. And the Galaxy Note — and big batteries in Galaxy phones more generally — also eventually made a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn4gkR"&gt;Samsung keeps trying. And it’s going to keep trying with foldables, where it has a significant lead on the competition and intends to keep it. This year, if you put the stronger screen, a more rigid frame, and that water resistance together, you get a story of a third generation of phones that Samsung hopes will finally put the disaster of the original, canceled Galaxy Fold to rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A deconstructed Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Va9QW0fvFXrR5thoBg73qj7YMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774800/4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deconstructed Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8Di51k"&gt;There’s no magic secret to making a phone water-resistant. Simply find all the places where water can get in and then seal them — either with glue or rubber gaskets. For a lot of the ingress points on folding phones, you just treat a folding phone as two separate phones. Sealing simple things like speaker holes, USB-C ports, and SIM card slots work exactly the same. Done and done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWJ5d9"&gt;But beyond those ingress points, there are complications and the solutions aren’t as straightforward when you’re working with a folding phone. The problem is movement. Specifically, there’s that pesky hinge, an even peskier flexible screen, and the peskiest of all: wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sealing a normal phone against water is usually a matter of simple rubber gaskets, as with this SIM card drawer on the Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_blSrPKsjfOCkXTdB2tbBs2zfWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774936/8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sealing a normal phone against water is usually a matter of simple rubber gaskets, as with this SIM card drawer on the Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 hinge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnxwoVhilAXBpvzSKuTMCnU393o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774812/16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no way to stop water from getting into the Z Fold 3 hinge, so Samsung lubricated the gears inside for protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nylon sweeper brushes on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0TwMhHFhzlM9pMXw7ODUrKdNOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774939/21.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nylon sweeper brushes on a Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="URQZ86"&gt;There’s simply no way to fully seal the hinge; there are too many moving parts that need to be placed in close proximity. Samsung’s solution for keeping dust out of the mechanism is tiny sets of nylon brushes cut to fit into caps that are less than a millimeter wide. (The company tried both carbon fiber and PET before landing on just using nylon.) It’s not a perfect fix for dust, but it has made a big difference in durability on the second generation of folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fc5igM"&gt;But brushes don’t stop liquid. So Samsung just accepted that and instead “developed a special type of lubricant that can really adhere well to all of the small components in the device,” says Hee-cheul Moon, principal engineer on Samsung’s mechanical team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Double-sided tape for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AGYoehVpp7-xvAGIFz5NGV9T-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774945/12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-sided tape for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Double-sided tape on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-wysVQhvNm1-AOCqjHqdiJu4OE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774948/22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-sided tape on a Galaxy Z Fold 3 surrounds every hole underneath the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYefM"&gt;All lubricant can wear off, but Samsung believes that its lubricant should be good for 200,000 folds. Samsung even doused it with Coke. To be fair, Samsung makes no claims that either phone will stand up to soda immersion. The Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 each are rated for IPX8 water resistance, which means they should be able to survive in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. You might be used to seeing IP68 resistance on devices like the iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21, but the “6” is code for a guarantee of dust resistance, which Samsung’s folding phones lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDY9Lb"&gt;As for the screen itself, it’s composed of multiple layers and Samsung simply sealed it up, using what it calls a pressure-sensitive adhesive. So if water gets in, it will literally flow between the screen and the two bodies of the phone, and also get into the hinge. All of that shouldn’t be a problem, Samsung says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDhGsZ"&gt;Sealing the two sides of the phone required new materials. On folding phones, the screen needs to float a bit above the body. It has to move just a bit when the body folds and unfolds. (You can see this most clearly on the Moto Razr, which has a screen that visibly slides around.) There are holes in the body of the phone that need to be sealed, and for that Samsung developed a thick, double-sided tape. It’s thick enough to allow the screen to slide just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83hiEd"&gt;That leaves one more problem to solve: the two sides of the phone need to be connected with wires. There is no way a simple rubber gasket around a flexible circuit board would work. Those ribbons need to move quite a bit in all three dimensions. Samsung’s fix is super smart: “cured in place gaskets.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A cured-in-place gasket for water sealing on a Galaxy Z Flip 3.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bJ1ghw"&gt;“When it’s dispensed, it’s in the liquid or fluid format,” says Moon. “Once it’s exposed to air, it becomes solid.” Think of it as a kind of flexible epoxy that sticks to the phone and the ribbon to make a watertight seal but still allows for more movement than a rubber gasket could. It’s goo when it’s first applied in the factory, and cured before assembly is finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqZLA0"&gt;Is all of this a repairability nightmare? Absolutely. Adhesives are the bane of fixing up phones, and with the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, Samsung has introduced no fewer than three new kinds of sticky materials. Samsung itself offers extended warranty services, and unfortunately, it seems like they might be a very important part of buying these phones — third-party repair shops are going to have a hard time dealing with all that double-sided tape and custom glue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen assembly on a Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5zw7EyqabQhp4gulAmX6vM9IgBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774818/20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen assembly on a Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dspjB3"&gt;Samsung’s big innovation with the Z Flip in 2020 was using Ultra Thin Glass in its folding displays. But it was an innovation that was hidden under literal layers of plastic. It might have helped with the screen’s durability and making it feel firmer, but the thing your thumb actually touched on both the Flip and Fold phones was still a piece of mushy plastic. (Plus, some phones began cracking at the hinge after some use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYCCHQ"&gt;This year, Samsung needed to solve those problems, add waterproofing, and tackle one more challenge: make sure that the Z Fold 3 would be able to endure having an S Pen stylus tapping and scritching away at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYEsfL"&gt;I have no idea if Samsung can really achieve all of those goals — but making the main screen stronger is the most important thing Samsung could do. It’s the part of the phone that’s most fragile and simultaneously the thing you interact with the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfVjIS"&gt;Samsung says it has rearranged the layers of the screen to improve durability. So now the order is the Wacom digitizer layer for stylus input (on the Z Fold 3 only), then the OLED display itself, then the Ultra Thin Glass, then a protective polymer layer, and finally the topmost layer, a new “Stretchable PET” (Polyethylene terephthalate) screen protector on top.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3 hinge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hv7j4fl1rTrX3xGl01NsTH-KdTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774810/14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung says its new PET screen protector is more durable and feels more like normal screen protectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn7nZZ"&gt;As with previous folding devices from Samsung, you are absolutely not supposed to remove that topmost layer. Unlike previous folding devices, this new stretchable PET should have fewer “marks of fingerprints and it’s less vulnerable to scratches or dents,” according to Byeng-seok Choi, a senior professional at the Flagship Product Planning Group at Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Wacom digitizer on the Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S8i3twSZ5a94hGiWFUlbVe3348Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775301/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_8.09.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The digitizer for stylus input has been split in two, and an algorithm determines location when the S Pen is between them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Z Fold 3-compatible S-Pen has a softer, rounded nib compared to other S-Pens." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ETeWv52N6n-kBy17aZDn5tpfV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775299/Screen_Shot_2021_08_10_at_8.08.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3-compatible S Pen has a softer, rounded nib compared to other S Pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUKRKW"&gt;Choi says that for the Z Fold 3, Samsung has achieved “a panel durability which is 80 percent or more higher than our previous iterations.” (Samsung claims it’s 30 percent stronger on the Flip.) He also claims that it should feel much more like the plastic screen protectors that are already commonly used on regular phones, “So, I believe that the users won’t notice much difference anyway, because they’ve already experienced this material.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV4LGO"&gt;My colleagues Becca Farsace and Chris Welch had a chance to see the phones in person and did notice that they seemed to be less likely to pick up fingerprints than earlier folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaAYHx"&gt;As for the Wacom digitizer, Samsung didn’t attempt to make that fold. Instead, there are two separate digitizers on each side of the phone. To the OS, it looks like a single panel — and the gap between them is handled by “a new algorithm” to calculate the stylus tip’s position using data from either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnyJ7Z"&gt;That all sounds good, but the story is undercut somewhat by Samsung’s solution for using an S Pen with the Z Fold 3. Instead of simply allowing customers to use existing S Pens, Samsung is selling a special version with a retractable tip. The tip of the S Pen now has a “rounded, rubber nib” that’s softer than previous versions. When too much pressure is applied, the tip will retract rather than let a user press too firmly on the screen. It’s a complicated solution that makes it clear there’s still a problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Armor Aluminum and parts from Samsung folding phones" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwJ_trXXw7ykztUKyzZv22F_698=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774825/27.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armor Aluminum and parts from Samsung folding phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="d537fQ"&gt;Lastly, Samsung is using a new aluminum alloy it developed, patented, and branded with a new name: Armor Aluminum. Samsung wouldn’t share what exact metals and processes it used to create it, but Sung-ho Cho, principal designer at Samsung’s Advanced Lab, says the company was “able to reinforce the strength by 10 percent or more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOBrXB"&gt;Samsung showed a brief demo where it knocked a block of its Armor Aluminum up against another block of 7000 series aluminum, which is what’s commonly used on smartphones now. (When a tech company touts “aerospace grade” in its aluminum, it’s usually referring to 7000 series.) The dent on Samsung’s alloy was, as you’d expect, much smaller than the damage to the 7000 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92kzq9"&gt;Samsung is using this new aluminum for the frames and hinges on the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, but it also plans on using it on more phones going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWif1j"&gt;Cho says that Samsung stuck with aluminum because of its weight but that this more rigid version of it should help with preventing screen cracks on the outside glass. “It provides such a strong and durable skeleton so that it minimizes the impact on other material,” he says. “It kind of acts as a shock buffer between the different materials.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A deconstructed Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLjmsYgZ0TFDQRTvD_jgyBBKmQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774817/19.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deconstructed Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r85Hb3"&gt;Samsung isn’t shy about its stated goal for foldables this year: make them mainstream. For the Z Flip 3, it’s finally brought the price under that conceptually important $1,000 price point. For the Z Fold 3, the price is still very high, but with stylus support and an under-screen selfie camera, it can legitimately replace the Note as Samsung’s spec-forward flagship phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPXMaa"&gt;But price is just one part of what Samsung needs to achieve here. With these durability claims, it’s hoping to remove one more barrier to making these phones feel like normal alternatives to regular glass slabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUlRMe"&gt;The thing about Samsung is that it’s easy to see when it gets things wrong. The screen fritzes out, the battery starts bulging, or the software gets littered with ads. Samsung gets things wrong all the time — too often, really. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbqKsm"&gt;But the other thing about Samsung is that it rarely walks away from an idea it believes in. And year by year, Samsung corrects its mistakes with small iterations that don’t draw much attention but do make the experience better. Until one year, quietly, Samsung gets it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="70vuUb"&gt;The only question left is whether this is the year. And if it’s not, can Samsung figure it out before another company finds a way to create a truly great folding phone?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is rebuilding its ads to know a lot less about you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNoKhFYiZOQqHNQbg3gfEkpzEB8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710029/Facebook_ads.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cWyULi"&gt;Facebook’s massive business was built on its ability to track users across the internet. But now, thanks to looming regulation and other moves to restrict such data collection, that is changing. Hundreds of engineers are rebuilding how Facebook’s ads work to place more value on user privacy, according to Graham Mudd, a top ad executive at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbIzbI"&gt;The moves by Facebook, which are still in their infancy, illustrate how the ad-supported internet economy is in the process of being fundamentally reshaped. Along with Google, Facebook is examining several privacy-enhancing techniques to deliver personalized ads without knowing anything about the specific individuals who view them. That’s an about-face from how ad targeting has worked online to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khRxG9"&gt;“We definitely see that [ads] personalization will evolve very meaningfully over the course of the next five years,” said Mudd, Facebook’s VP of product marketing for ads, in an exclusive interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And that investing well ahead of that will benefit all of our customers and enable us to help shape that future state of the ads ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nFYFfr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The stakes couldn’t be higher for Facebook to get this right&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cY4j2y"&gt;The stakes couldn’t be higher for Facebook to get this right. Apple recently introduced a prompt to iPhones that makes developers ask for permission to track users across other apps for targeting ads. Facebook has said the prompt will likely hurt its revenue growth. Google is planning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466531/google-android-ad-traking-advertising-identifier-id"&gt;something similar&lt;/a&gt; for Android phones. The European Union is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/targeted-advertising-tech-privacy/"&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; a ban on microtargeted ads as part of a sweeping legislative proposal called the Digital Services Act, and the Biden administration recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;signaled&lt;/a&gt; interest in policing the “surveillance of users” by “dominant Internet platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maSm2i"&gt;Facebook’s new rhetoric about making advertising more privacy-conscious is also, in a sense, admitting defeat. Last year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;mounted a loud PR campaign&lt;/a&gt; in objection to Apple’s ad tracking prompt, arguing that Apple was acting anti-competitively and harming small businesses that relied on ads to reach customers. But the campaign ultimately fell flat, and now Facebook is working on some of the same privacy-conscious approaches to data collection that Apple uses. One example is “differential privacy,” a technique that intentionally messes with datasets to obfuscate individual identities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjMH8v"&gt;Facebook’s problems with Apple, which is currently building up &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-changes-are-poised-to-boost-its-ad-products-11619485863"&gt;its own ads business&lt;/a&gt;, are far from over. Given Apple’s tight control of the iPhone, the two will likely butt heads on an area of technology Facebook is exploring called “on-device learning.” Instead of sending data about users to the cloud, an algorithm runs locally on a phone to determine the kinds of ads someone would find compelling and then show them said ads. The results are later sent back to the cloud in an anonymized and aggregate format for advertisers to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="531sfy"&gt;“I think one of the challenges with on-device learning is that the compute resources required to do it are obviously under the control of the operating systems themselves,” Mudd told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHlPGU"&gt;Mudd, a nine-year Facebook veteran and key leader internally on this shift in philosophy about how ads work, spoke to me in conjunction with &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/building-for-the-future"&gt;a corporate blog post published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that outlines the company’s approach to building privacy-minded ads. We covered a lot of ground, but fair warning that parts of the conversation get somewhat technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6ytuw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kJ4Mc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Heath, senior reporter, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: What is driving all these changes that you all are working on as it relates to ads and privacy? Is it a fear of regulation that’s coming? You all raised a big stink about Apple’s ad tracking prompt for iPhone apps last year, saying it was anti-competitive and going to hurt small businesses. But this seems to me like capitulating to that philosophy to a degree.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlaLQK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graham Mudd, VP of product marketing, Facebook:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a very reasonable question. I would say that in general we both understand and frankly believe in the long-term direction of travel that the industry is headed in, which is towards both more transparency [and] more control over a certain type of data. And that type of data is widely referred to as third-party data. But it’s basically the data that businesses share primarily, in the case of advertising, with ad platforms. It’s used for measurement, for ad delivery, and optimization, and targeting and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9vdSC"&gt;And I think what we see in terms of the trends and frankly our own work, both from a regulatory perspective and the platforms — Google and Apple — is that access to that kind of data will become more limited over the course of the next couple of years. That’s just a reflection, I think, of peoples’ changing expectations around privacy. And I think we’re embracing and trying to build for that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFGVJM"&gt;A big part of building for that future is developing new privacy-enhancing technologies that allow us to do the kinds of things that we have done in the past, like measurement and ad optimization, but in a way that is far more privacy conscious, that doesn’t allow either party, the advertiser or the ad platform — in this case Facebook — to learn new information about individual users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvIYBO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure multi-party computation (MPC). It’s a mouthful. It’s this technology you all talk about in the new blog post. It essentially encrypts data about users that’s shared between companies for ad targeting. I don’t see how that will be easy to do under Apple’s new ad tracking prompt in iOS, which explicitly asks users if they want to block an app from sharing data with other companies. Google’s Android is planning something similar. Do you think that technique works under the platform rules that we’re already seeing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DRJjF"&gt;I don’t think we’ve had any clear guidance from Apple or others about specific technology and whether that’s acceptable given their policy. I think what is clear is that if you read into the approach Apple is taking, when consent isn’t there, that is when a user hasn’t opted in, they absolutely have developed APIs — as have we — to move data back and forth between companies but in a more anonymous way, primarily using aggregation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnXYWy"&gt;This [MPC] is just another approach to anonymous data sharing. Instead of it necessarily being aggregate, you’re using encryption and cryptography technology to ensure that the same end is met, which is that you don’t learn anything about an individual. So philosophically, I think it’s very well aligned. And in fact, I think a lot of experts would say that it is more privacy safe or conscious than just aggregation. Because with aggregation alone, unless there are other protections like differential privacy in place, you can still back into learning about an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lGj31"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think the most interesting technology you mention in the blog post is on-device learning, which essentially moves how ads are targeted from the cloud to an algorithm that runs locally on someone’s phone. Apple is already doing this to a degree. I’m curious if that’s a technique you think third-party apps like Facebook can do well without owning the mobile phone system like Apple and Google? Because I could see Apple opting to give itself preferential treatment for how this kind of data is locally treated and the ad creative it can process and all that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51Bj51"&gt;Yes, I think one of the challenges with on-device learning is that the compute resources required to do it are obviously under the control of the operating systems themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x78rls"&gt;And so if standards are built around how those resources are accessed and used in ways that support competition, then that makes a lot of sense. One of the benefits of multi-party computation is that it doesn’t necessarily require this central operation through an operating system or a device manufacturer. That is one of the reasons that we’re very interested in MPC relative to federated learning or on-device. But we’re very much supportive of the development there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq5AVL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I thought it was interesting that, based on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598592/facebook-second-quarter-earnings-29-billion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;your last earnings call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, higher prices for Facebook ads are what will drive revenue growth for the next couple of quarters. I think most people probably don’t understand this, but Facebook and Google operate auctions for serving ads, meaning that prices are in a sense set by demand. So I’m curious if higher prices are a function of advertisers seeing Facebook as a place they have to spend, even if your ads are becoming less effective due to the Apple prompt or regulation? Or is it just because the ads are becoming less effective and thereby more expensive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cefpa9"&gt;Good question. I think that it’s definitely more a function of the relative value of the outcomes that our ad platforms drive compared to the outcomes that [advertisers] can drive elsewhere. Like you said, it’s an auction. And so advertisers’ willingness to pay is dictated by basically two things: What is the performance of the platform? And what is that performance relative to what they can get elsewhere? And so those are the core drivers of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TPVoy"&gt;If our ads become significantly less performant over time, then you can expect that will drive down prices and not drive up prices, at least on a CPM basis, right? Because willingness to pay is dictated by the performance that can be derived through the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1scK9P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Facebook and Google are still the best places to advertise even if the data isn’t as good anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBCwgx"&gt;Yeah, I mean obviously it’s hard for us to comment on what performance looks like on other platforms. One of the things that we are really concerned about is ensuring that the advertising ecosystem does remain competitive. And I would say that some of the changes that have been introduced make it particularly harder for smaller publishers or ad networks to operate competitively. So I think all the more reason, frankly, for these types of privacy enhancing technologies to consider not just what works for the big guys, but also smaller publishers that have much less opportunity to build out first-party datasets of the kind that larger platforms oftentimes have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdOdXl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can be honest that small businesses succeeding with advertising is how Facebook also succeeds with advertising. That’s your main cohort. I’ve heard from marketers who buy ads on Facebook. In the last few months, they’ve had some small business clients who probably won’t make it because their ads are less effective and therefore more expensive. They can’t spend to reach new customers. I don’t think most people understand how thin these margins can be for small businesses and how they’ve relied on cheap, effective ads to date.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HULC5u"&gt;Couldn’t agree more. In general, smaller businesses are the most vulnerable to these types of changes. And so not only is it important for us to build technologies that allow us to maintain the relevance and performance of ads while making meaningful progress on the privacy front; we also have to do it in a way that they can actually implement from a technical complexity perspective without the kinds of expertise that larger advertisers oftentimes have at their disposal. So yeah, it’s a combination of the technology itself and hopefully over time the ease with which it can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3ubJg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online commerce was a thing well before the pandemic, when you all really started adding shopping features in earnest. I’m curious why shopping wasn’t this much of a focus internally before? Does it have to do with Apple’s changes and other regulations making it harder to track users? If you can’t see when someone makes a purchase outside of Facebook, but you bring that purchasing behavior inside Facebook, you still get to track it and prove that the ad worked, right?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UffFRJ"&gt;I was involved in some of the work on commerce during the early days of the pandemic, and what I can tell you is that the primary impetus for the acceleration of our work in that space was the recognition that smaller businesses were really disproportionately harmed, and they were having a really difficult time setting up an online presence and a storefront. And so it was born primarily out of a desire to help to the degree that we could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpZf7Y"&gt;I think part of what is so challenging about setting up an e-commerce presence if you are a smaller business these days is the way that data flows in our industry is becoming more and more complex and more and more constrained. And so the point you’re making is a very reasonable one. When you set up a storefront on Facebook, it will be easier for us over time to support that storefront with personalized advertising, given that we don’t need to rely on it being shared through an app over a platform that constraints it. It can be equally, if not more, privacy safe in the sense that it never needs to leave our walls. We’ve reduced the amount of data sharing that’s required, which is, at the end of the day, what I think a lot of these changes are meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEj8Y2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think Apple in particular will eventually make it harder for you to collect data about your own users in Facebook’s apps? I know this is a concern that some of your colleagues have. Because right now the focus is on limiting how data is shared between companies. But what if Apple comes for how apps collect data about their own users? I don’t think it’s beyond the realm of possibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKi7Hl"&gt;We would be concerned about that for sure. That said, what’s important to us is that, at every step of the process, our users are fully aware of how data is being collected and used and that it’s intuitive to the degree that we can make it so. I think there’s a lot we as an industry can do to make sure that’s the case. And that limits the potential for those types of actions. In many respects, Apple has defined privacy in such a way that as long as data isn’t shared it can be used to support many different products, including advertising. I think many of their products reflect exactly that philosophy. So it might be a bit challenging to constrain it unless they did so for everyone, including themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3G5wBr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think I know the answer to this one, but speaking of Apple’s prompt, can you give me a sense of how many Facebook and Instagram users have opted into the prompt since you all rolled it out? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucFgll"&gt;Yeah, I think your intuition is correct. Unfortunately, we’re not sharing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9posb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could we ever see Facebook show ads that aren’t personalized at all? Or introduce a toggle to let users decide if they want to see personalized ads or not? Is that something you all have thought about or something we could see? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4Bj63"&gt;Well, we already have controls that I think are pretty well related to that. We have what’s called an online behavioral advertising control. So you can turn off the use of third-party data for advertising already. You can also — through another control called Off-Facebook Activity— at the advertiser level, decide whether you want data associated with your account and used in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69ecMh"&gt;Now there are, of course, degrees of personalization. And so is there a way, if you’re a user, to reduce all personalization so the ads you see are entirely random? No, that’s not a control we have nor one I can imagine us building, because I think we believe pretty strongly that personalization in marketing is the best possible experience for people and for businesses. But the way that personalization occurs — does it use third-party data versus first-party data, or do I have control over what types of ads are useful and interesting to me — that’s the kind of thing that we are very much invested in and will continue to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDu3IG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give me a sense of what this effort is like inside Facebook? Is there a dedicated team that has been set up to work on these new ad products? This reminds me of some big pivots Facebook has done over the years. I imagine that this is a new way of thinking about the business and the technology for you all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0mSMI"&gt;I think you’re absolutely right that this is a very meaningful pivot. We definitely see that personalization will evolve very meaningfully over the course of the next five years, and that investing well ahead of that will benefit all of our customers and enable us to help shape that future state of the ads ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCiKr2"&gt;So yeah, there are definitely dedicated teams and hundreds of engineers who are working on these types of technologies. Because data and personalization is at the heart of almost every one of our systems, from targeting to ad optimization to measurement, almost all our systems will be rebuilt over the next couple of years. And that’s already very much in progress, to reflect this change in how data is used in support of advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uwflxa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like there’s a disconnect between the media world and the world of regulators about data and advertising and what matters versus what normal people care about. I’m not sure normal people even know the difference between first-party or third-party data, much less think that sharing third-party data is somehow evil or anti-privacy. Obviously, we’ve seen examples of how that has been abused by data brokers, but those are edge cases it seems. I’m curious if you think this is actually a trend that will resonate with normal people who are Facebook users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hEvv1"&gt;We certainly do a lot of research into peoples’ sentiments and beliefs around privacy, and those help to shape the investments that we’ve made. I would say that in most of these cases, regulators, policymakers, and the media tend to be both ahead of and helping to shape consumer opinion here, as is their role. What we’re trying to build for is that longer-term future state. And if you just look at the trends in both regulation, platform changes, and consumer sentiment, this approach to us makes a lot of sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ7Fl2"&gt;So yeah, I think if your read is that the policy elite are ahead of the general population in terms of their understanding on this? Yes, I think that is accurate. But we are seeing consumer sentiments shift as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgXo4G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you agree that prioritizing first-party data and limiting third-party sharing creates further entrenched, large companies? I think it does. I think it makes you all more powerful. I think it makes Google more powerful. The apps with scale will adapt and get bigger. That could be an unintended consequence of Apple and all this regulation around data sharing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjfLJq"&gt;I think there have been many folks who have pointed out the paradox between privacy and competition. I think that’s what you’re driving at, and I agree that relationship exists and it’s something that we need to be really conscious of. I think there definitely are ways to improve privacy that end up harming competition meaningfully. But I think there are also approaches that don’t have that effect, or at least have a much less meaningful impact on competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3DeRe"&gt;To be honest, I think one of the most important ways to do that is through industry collaboration. And in some cases, we’ve seen that work really well. And in other cases, when that’s not there, what we end up seeing is that the either intended or unintended consequence becomes much more real. Put simply, I would say collaboration is the best antidote to the potential competitive harms of privacy changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EHHsv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you all fairly aligned with Google on this? I know Google is more in the federated learning camp. It’s doing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLoC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387492/google-floc-ad-tech-privacy-browsers-brave-vivaldi-edge-mozilla-chrome-safari"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;getting a lot of pushback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Is this march toward more privacy-conscious ads something that you and Google will work together on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVe5iU"&gt;Yeah, these are the types of technologies that we are very much seeking feedback on and talking about in forums like the W3C, where Google is a very meaningful participant. We absolutely hope that they will continue to engage on this and provide feedback. And the same is true of our other partners in the industry. But I just want to be super clear: I think our view is that the path forward here is likely an ensemble of privacy enhancing technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cUp3t"&gt;It’s not a situation of it’s FLoC or MPC. FLoC addresses a specific use case — behavioral targeting — without revealing anything about a given individual. And the beta that we have running right now is really focused on measurement. In some cases federated learning is going to be the right underlying technology to implement to support a given use case. And in other cases it might be multi-party computation. I don’t think there’s necessarily a silver bullet here. And these technologies don’t necessarily compete with each other because they’re addressing, in some cases at least, different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tT6cpx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook seems to be setting the stage for big changes. You said you are in the process of rebuilding a lot of the core technology. I’m thinking about two things right now: You have custom audiences and you have lookalikes, which are the underpinnings of how you all have grown into the ad behemoth you are. They let advertisers easily use data from other places to match people on your apps and reach those people. Are custom audiences and lookalikes going away, or at least going in a more anonymous direction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIPcL1"&gt;I think you can assume that over time they do become more anonymous, or at least more privacy conscious for sure. I’ll give you an example on lookalikes: Right now lookalikes often use a seed audience — a group of people that an advertiser knows or has a relationship with. If an advertiser and Facebook have the consent of that user to share that user-level information, then our expectation is that will continue and should continue. Consent will play a really important role in products like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wamy3M"&gt;But in cases where we don’t have consent, that’s where privacy enhancing technologies like multi-party computation can actually play a pretty meaningful role in trying to understand which types of people would find an ad relevant without ever learning about individual people. The whole point of a lookalike audience is actually not to target necessarily distinct individuals that have been identified by one of our partners; it’s to find new customers. And MPC allows us to identify those users without learning about the individuals that might have been the audience in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp to allow chat history transfers between iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X2brZDnuXD5qdkpL7r3K_JFmbrA=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69710030/Cross_Platform_Switch_UI__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The transfer process.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OcEv6z"&gt;WhatsApp is adding the ability to bring your chat history with you when you switch from iOS to Android — including all voice notes, photos, and conversations. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597661/whatsapp-ios-to-android-chat-history-backup-transfer"&gt;long-rumored feature&lt;/a&gt; was announced during Samsung’s launch event today and will initially cover transfers from iOS to the company’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; and other Samsung phones “in the coming weeks.” Eventually, the feature will cover all transfers between iOS and Android phones, though it’s unclear when it’ll be available for all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl2fRL"&gt;The new feature should help address one of WhatsApp’s most frustrating elements, which is that it’s never been officially possible to transfer your chat history between mobile operating systems. If you choose to use WhatsApp’s cloud backup feature, then iOS chat histories are stored in iCloud, while Android’s are in Google Drive, meaning it’s only possible to transfer your chats between phones running the same operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HNOYLm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The process uses a physical connector cable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XV3VxI"&gt;The new feature transfers chat histories using a physical Lightning to USB-C cable rather than sending them via the internet. Unfortunately, if you’ve transferred between iOS and Android in the past and have two separate cloud backups, the new transfer feature won’t merge them together into a single chat history. Instead, WhatsApp tells me that if you use it to migrate your chat history and then back it up, it’ll overwrite any existing backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZfpOW"&gt;WhatsApp says the new feature will allow transfers from iOS to Samsung’s new foldables at first, and it will allow transfers to Samsung devices running Android 10 and up “in the coming weeks.” It declined to say when the feature might arrive for non-Samsung Android phones or when it’ll allow Android to iOS transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 review: nailing the basics with style</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;When the entry-level earbuds are this good, why go Pro?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JrxXrK"&gt;Alongside the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is also introducing the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748797006058682479#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;. The $149 earbuds replace the Galaxy Buds Plus as the entry-level position in the company’s lineup. That family now consists of the Galaxy Buds Pro, bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live, and the Galaxy Buds 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqDxM1"&gt;The Buds 2 improve upon their predecessors by adding active noise cancellation. But in the few days I’ve spent with them so far, I’d say the bigger, most impressive progress Samsung has made is with their design and fit. These are the company’s smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds yet. And in my ears, the Buds 2 provide a flush, discreet fit that uniquely stands out among the company’s top competitors. Still, they trail the Buds Plus in battery life, so not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is necessarily better. But Samsung got enough right that these could end up the new go-to pick for Android users who want an easy and reliable pair of wireless earbuds with satisfying sound. In fact, Samsung did so well with the Buds 2 that the flagship Buds Pro just became a much harder sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="srqG5p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10695648"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2cV6tz"&gt;The Buds 2 come in a case that’s similar in size and shape to the Buds Pro and Buds Live before them; Samsung seems to have settled on this jewelry box style for the whole lineup, and I can’t complain. It’s small enough to be comfortably pocketable, supports wireless charging, and closes with a nice &lt;em&gt;thunk&lt;/em&gt;. The outside of the case is a glossy white, while the matte interior is color matched to whichever hue of the Buds 2 you get: white, dark gray, green, or purple. The earbuds themselves have a glossy finish, which could make them a little slippery in the summer heat, but so far I’ve managed to not drop them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKKynJBCoA04Zi7RagNuJaU9rdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775336/IMG_1106_Edited_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 replace the Galaxy Buds Plus in Samsung’s earbuds lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="doApXY"&gt;They’ve got a similar curved shape to the Buds Pro, but the reduced size makes the Buds 2 practically disappear into the crevices of your ear. Looking at someone wearing them straight on, you could miss the Buds 2 entirely. They’re really that subtle. Comparing them to the bulkier Galaxy Buds or Buds Plus, you’re left with an indisputable example of the leveling up Samsung has done in earbud design. If you’re more interested in earbuds as a fashion accessory, the Galaxy Buds Live still exude more unique style. But I’ll take the barely there Buds 2 any day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUB1AP"&gt;Considering how well concealed the Buds 2 are, I assumed voice call quality would suffer. But Samsung managed to outperform my expectations here. Those I spoke to on the phone or over Zoom said it very much sounded like I was speaking through earbuds — but the mics were able to pick up on everything I said without issue. Samsung says the Buds 2 include a new “machine learning-based solution that filters out a variety of distracting background noises.” I’m not sure how much that’s really doing, but I can make calls on the Buds 2 and be confident they won’t be a garbled mess. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5MXoS9PYWRG6dC3Rv5svetGDnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774320/cwelch_210809_4705_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are Samsung’s smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DgYa5J"&gt;Battery life is the one criteria where the Buds 2 can’t measure up to the Buds Plus. Samsung estimates they’ll run for up to five hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled (with the case stretching that to 20 hours). Turning noise cancellation off will extend that to 7.5 hours (or 29 hours including the case). That’s by no means bad, but it’s several hours short of the 11 hours of straight play time the Buds Plus could achieve, which frankly puts those earbuds in their own league. I don’t know many circumstances where you’d be listening to music for 11 hours in a row without ever putting the earbuds back in their case (or just for the sake of giving your ears a break), and it seems Samsung was willing to trade some stamina for this smaller, sleeker form factor. I think it was the right decision. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXFLXuo6JoKWzpabyCSgtcElC8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776008/DSCF4579.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Buds 2 sit very flush against your inner ear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f7hJ5u"&gt;But what about the Galaxy Buds Pro? How do Samsung’s entry-level earbuds stack up to its most expensive pair? The company predictably says its top-tier earbuds deliver superior audio quality and more powerful ANC. The latter point is accurate: the Buds 2 have the kind of noise cancellation that’s competent but never wows. Their ambient sound also sounds very computerized and artificial, so that’s another area where the Buds Pro fare better. And some features like 360 audio and automatic switching between Samsung devices are absent. I think the most significant real-world difference between the Buds 2 and Buds Pro that will matter to potential buyers is that the latter are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance. The Buds 2 are a mere IPX2, so using them in the rain is risky, and trainers or athletes who will sweat a lot might want to go with something more durable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4DE1eRYCHyLC3UAGXtbTZgmCxE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774316/cwelch_210809_4705_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case has a USB-C port and also supports wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xgNq2Q"&gt;Those sacrifices aside, they deliver on the sound front — to the point where telling the two sets of earbuds apart just by sound signature can be challenging. Like the Buds Pro, the Buds 2 have a two-way driver design with a woofer and tweeter in each earbud. The bass and treble are dialed up in keeping with the standard EQ curve that many consumers find pleasing to their ears. But I was pleasantly surprised by the broad soundstage of the Buds 2 when listening to the latest Bleachers record, &lt;em&gt;Take The Sadness Out of Saturday Night&lt;/em&gt;. Bruce Springsteen’s voice cuts through with just the right touch of grit on “Chinatown,” and even busier tracks like “Stop Making This Hurt” have a nice layered sound rather than coming across as muddled. The earbuds support AAC, SBC, and Samsung’s Scalable codecs, and they’ve mostly been free of audio glitches or cutouts in my time testing them so far. I’ve had the sound occasionally go warbly for a couple seconds when walking on a busy street, but on the whole, performance is solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="zGf8Pe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10695658"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxaAF1"&gt;Since the Buds 2 are Samsung’s least expensive true wireless earbuds, you don’t get the whole grab bag of features that are standard on pricier models: there’s no auto-pause when you remove an earbud, for example. But that’s not to say there aren’t thoughtful inclusions: when you remove one earbud, ANC is automatically disabled on the other to prevent discomfort, and ambient mode is switched on to help you hear what’s happening. Once you reseat the original earbud, noise cancellation kicks back in. That’s not a mind-blowing trick, but I’ll take it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loA4CT"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Wearables app includes the usual set of options to locate your misplaced buds or customize their controls. The Buds 2 recognize single, double, and triple taps, and you can also assign a function for a press and hold gesture. You need to be somewhat deliberate with your taps for them to register, but aside from that the controls have worked consistently. The companion app also now has a fit test to see which of the included three sizes of silicone tips is the best match for your ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68TRqo"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 didn’t need to blow the doors off to be a success. They’re destined to become the default pick for many Android phone owners — especially once the sales, discounts, and bundles with new phones start hitting. They sound perfectly good, fit comfortably, and perform reliably. But above all else, I’m taken with just how compact and low-profile these earbuds are. Just like its latest foldables, the Galaxy Buds 2 are evidence that Samsung isn’t sitting still. It’s hitting on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="DVOBgU"&gt;Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22608535/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-z-fold-flip-earbuds-watches"&gt;August Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; took place today with foldables and wearables tossed about, but it appears that OnePlus has a thirst for attention that simply can’t wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vF5RFu"&gt;The company tweeted out this &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSZhpf1C9WW/"&gt;brief video clip&lt;/a&gt; with some kind of two-screened mobile device, although it was unclear exactly what we should expect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8XjCDG"&gt;What we could expect... &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSb8HNLi5a6/"&gt;was a 50 percent off sale&lt;/a&gt; for the OnePlus 9. Are two phones the same as one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;? It won’t leave you with a seam in the middle of the screen, but I doubt they’re targeting the same market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A hacker stole over $600 million of crypto coins — now they might be giving it back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T5Du1pQ52hAoSaWgvvnciKHK4xQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709882/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p0O3cx"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114045/at-least-611-million-stolen-in-massive-cross-chain-hack"&gt;estimated that over $600 million worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; has been stolen as the result of a hack on a protocol called the Poly Network. And now, whoever stole it seems to be in the process of returning it, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/cryptocurrency-theft-hackers-steal-600-million-in-poly-network-hack.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1425440880824143873?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chainalysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/hackers-steal-600-million-in-likely-largest-defi-crypto-theft"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s quite possibly one of the largest hacks in the decentralized finance, or DeFi, space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGRo3R"&gt;The Poly Network is a protocol that lets people transfer cryptocurrencies between blockchains. And because of that role as a bridge, the stolen assets come in the form of &lt;a href="https://bscscan.com/tokenholdings?a=0x0d6e286a7cfd25e0c01fee9756765d8033b32c71"&gt;hundreds of different types&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xc8a65fadf0e0ddaf421f28feab69bf6e2e589963"&gt;of tokens&lt;/a&gt; — from Ethereum to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573812/binance-crash-cryptocurrency-regulation-lawsuit"&gt;Binance&lt;/a&gt;’s BNB to Dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijPa0M"&gt;The Poly Network cites the massive amount of money stolen in a message to the hacker, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425123153009803267?s=20"&gt;which it posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The message begins “Dear Hacker” and goes on to talk about how the attacker would be in trouble with law enforcement for stealing from “the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84lPXI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Yzw4oDenjC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yzw4oDenjC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Poly Network (@PolyNetwork2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425123153009803267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tE2HG2"&gt;The message may have worked. The hacker posted a string of messages (by embedding text in transactions sent to themselves), saying they were ready to return the stolen funds but &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x79245fb1d1ae48a214118e25d6ad2f9324f514ec6708135a19ba9d4cfa6344f6"&gt;needed some way to send them back&lt;/a&gt; to Poly Network. Poly Network &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425321860539949056"&gt;provided addresses&lt;/a&gt; to send the crypto to, and the coins have started to flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylFZkp"&gt;As of 10AM ET on Wednesday, around $5 million have been returned, but it seems that the attacker is getting rid of the lower-value cryptos first. They &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa7cd9cb0211942998602e22ad6f7fd7d9c1eef9515f4e4154a76237d5fd71aa3"&gt;embedded a message&lt;/a&gt; saying they were “DUMPING SHITCOINS FIRST.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SbxVVL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Perhaps they got tired of the hundreds of people begging for a Robin Hood-esque redistribution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xM3QDQ"&gt;There have been multiple theories about how the attack was carried out. One security team says that, &lt;a href="https://blocksecteam.medium.com/the-initial-analysis-of-the-polynetwork-hack-270ac6072e2a"&gt;according to its initial analysis&lt;/a&gt;, either the attacker was able to sign transactions with a legitimate private key or they were able to exploit a bug to get a message signed. Poly Network has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425130017546149891"&gt;pushed back on that analysis&lt;/a&gt;, saying the attackers exploited an interaction between two contracts. Poly Network pointed to &lt;a href="https://slowmist.medium.com/the-root-cause-of-poly-network-being-hacked-ec2ee1b0c68f"&gt;another security firm’s research&lt;/a&gt; that found similar results. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1425440880824143873?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chainalysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has said that it will post a full analysis today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu6OSb"&gt;It’s likely that we won’t know what really happened until a more thorough investigation has been done, and we won’t know how much the hacker actually got away with. It’s possible the crypto community will rally to blacklist the stolen tokens, making them essentially worthless — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1425090760609832978"&gt;it’s already been done&lt;/a&gt; for around $33 million worth of tokens, but it wouldn’t be so easy for the rest of them. &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114045/at-least-611-million-stolen-in-massive-cross-chain-hack"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the frozen assets were USDT coins, which are under the control of a company called Tether. A lot of the other stolen coins though, are decentralized — meaning no one entity can decide what can or can’t happen with them, and there are no promises as to what the community will decide to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iUO61T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are aware of the &lt;a href="https://t.co/IgGJ0598Q0"&gt;https://t.co/IgGJ0598Q0&lt;/a&gt; exploit that occurred today. While no one controls BSC (or ETH), we are coordinating with all our security partners to proactively help. There are no guarantees. We will do as much as we can. Stay &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SAFU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SAFU&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/TG0dKPapQT"&gt;https://t.co/TG0dKPapQT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CZ   Binance (@cz_binance) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1425091869709570060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zFZHO5"&gt;There’s also the question as to why the attacker has started returning the funds. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114045/at-least-611-million-stolen-in-massive-cross-chain-hack"&gt;they posted a message that read&lt;/a&gt;, in part “not so interested in money, now considering returning some tokens or just leaving them here.” Since then, they’ve &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd239b01026c49b234d075e3d23a07efd1c3234239cfb440c0f90d5e84836fbe2"&gt;posted a message&lt;/a&gt; saying that returning the money (or saving the world, as they put it) will make them “an eternal legend.” But &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87715ad26621431c2c27f44d9214798e0c81a97d938ba5d4580dcd72f07ec6a8"&gt;another message they posted&lt;/a&gt;, asking for donations from those who support their decision to return the funds, calls the “not so interested in money” thing into question. Perhaps they’re simply returning the funds out of fear that they wouldn’t be able to use them or they got tired of the &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-panhandlers-beg-poly-network-attacker-for-share-of-613m-haul"&gt;hundreds of people begging for a Robin Hood-esque redistribution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Start11 brings a classic Start menu back to Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rIg6BoPmu771Xs3iihcRH_vZejk=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709820/S11_10.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start11 includes an old style of the Windows Start menu.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Stardock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVJJq8"&gt;Stardock is back again with another app to skin the appearance of the Windows Start menu. This time, it’s for Windows 11, which hasn’t even been fully released yet. &lt;a href="https://www.stardock.com/products/start11/"&gt;Start11 is available as a beta&lt;/a&gt;, and it brings back the classic appearance of the Windows Start menu inside Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpWny6"&gt;“This first beta is designed to regain some of the lost functionality in the current Windows 11 Start menu,” &lt;a href="https://www.stardock.com/news/506215/stardock-announces-start11---get-into-the-beta-today"&gt;says Brad Wardell&lt;/a&gt;, Stardock CEO. “We have a lot of exciting new features planned to make the Start menu not just more accessible but also more useful to companies and power users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6rmlaR53sTJtPtI3ciMeRC--iyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775860/start11_beta1_ss02.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start11’s Windows 7-style Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MgFh25Sa4d4hKeqmOsDxpHdcY38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775862/start11_beta1_ss01_min.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Stardock&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start11’s modern Start menu with classic features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W33xAC"&gt;Start11 includes a configuration UI that will support future Start menu designs, according to Stardock. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/13/9147089/stardock-start10-windows-10-start-menu-app"&gt;previous Start10 app&lt;/a&gt; aimed to bring back the classic Windows 7 Start menu to Windows 10, Start11 will go further in future to add extra features to the Windows 11 Start menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="327jvJ"&gt;“Start11 will be extending this to support a host of new Start menu ideas such as the concept of pages, tabs, minimalism, and features for our enterprise customers,” explains Wardell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2ghby"&gt;The Start11 beta is &lt;a href="https://www.stardock.com/products/start11/"&gt;available today&lt;/a&gt;, priced at $4.99, and offers the choice between a Windows 7-style Start menu or a more modern one that brings back some of the classic style and features of the Start menu.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Galaxy Buds 2 with active noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYmdftXD65HRDUQ3mF5BLeRn598=/0x81:2040x1441/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709726/02_02_Berry_Family_01_galaxybuds2_family_graphite_white_olive_lavender_H.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qlb9bM"&gt;In addition to launching two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; foldable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381267"&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt; and a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"&gt;smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung today announced its latest set of wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 2 cost $149.99 and will replace the Galaxy Buds Plus in the company’s lineup. (It’s still possible to find remaining stock of the Buds Plus at some retailers, but they’ll be gone once that inventory runs dry.) Preorders start today in a range of colors that include dark gray, white, purple, and green, and the Buds 2 will be available on August 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wIFP0"&gt;They’ve got a design that’s similar to the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, only smaller. In fact, Samsung says these are the smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds it has made yet. Also like the Buds Pro, the Buds 2 have two-way drivers with a woofer and tweeter in each earbud that “deliver crisp, clear high notes and a deep bass.” They set themselves apart from the older Buds Plus with the addition of active noise cancellation, and Samsung includes an ambient sound mode that lets you adjust how much outside noise is let through. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uj51j-oVYboufbVKgY8BFuIh9zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775057/DSC01569.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 come in four colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3hGXR"&gt;Battery life for the Buds 2 is up to five hours of continuous playback with noise cancellation enabled (or 20 hours including the case). Switching off the ANC can extend those numbers to 7.5 hours and 29 hours with the case, which supports wireless charging. That doesn’t quite match the marathon 11 hours of nonstop listening that was possible with the Galaxy Buds Plus, but I think Samsung has made enough improvements here to accept that tradeoff. Just don’t expect much in the way of water or sweat resistance, as these are only rated IPX2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfZXyk"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are now the cheapest product in Samsung’s earbuds lineup: they join the $199.99 Galaxy Buds Plus and $169.99 Galaxy Buds Live, though both of those sets are on sale as I write this. I’d expect similar discounts on the Buds 2 eventually, which might make them hard to resist as the new default wireless buds for many Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vkAy_MA7eXdDv0cMKvhzUoQFHcQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709729/cwelch_210809_4701_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The flagship foldable now has a 120Hz cover screen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0w0eqe"&gt;It’s August, and today is Samsung’s latest big Unpacked event. Normally that would mean the time has come for a new Galaxy Note. But in the company’s own words, not “this time around.” There’s no new Note being announced this year, and so the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra will stay right where they are in Samsung’s lineup. Instead, this summer the focus is on  what Samsung sees as the future of phones: foldables. The company has just introduced the new Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, a pair of devices that showcase the potential of folding screens in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tIGL5"&gt;The Z Fold 3 is a productivity powerhouse that now has 120Hz displays both inside and out. And it’s carrying over some of the Galaxy Note’s DNA by adding support for the S Pen stylus. But what’s even more important than the usual spec upgrades is the message Samsung is sending about durability: the Fold 3 is more resilient than its predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeOr2A"&gt;Remember: this is technically the &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; Galaxy Fold if you count the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511170/samsung-galaxy-fold-delay-indefinitely-statement-screen-display-broken-issues"&gt;flawed, abandoned first attempt&lt;/a&gt;, and the company recognizes there are still lingering durability concerns it needs to overcome. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;made strides with the Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, but some people still encountered cracking screens and other show-stopping problems from normal usage that just shouldn’t happen — even if Samsung’s customer service made it right for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N7EqwY3wJ9ltWxXj_rzTis_zbNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773894/cwelch_210809_4701_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s first foldable phone to work with the S Pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0ZZgK"&gt;So for the Fold 3, Samsung made a slew of changes to the device’s materials and internal design that should give the $1,799 foldable smartphone a better chance of lasting years into the future. It looks similar to the Fold 2, but refinements are everywhere. The screen’s protective film is now 80 percent stronger; Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;using Gorilla Glass Victus on the cover screen&lt;/a&gt; for improved drop protection; the aluminum in the Fold 3’s hinge is now 10 percent stronger. And the entire device is now rated IPX8 for water resistance, meaning you can submerge it for up to 30 minutes and it should come out unscathed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9Y8uLKny8i2vHz8hkHx8fuOFRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773896/cwelch_210809_4701_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3’s cover screen now has an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IpchRbs_7eLZFtcrhVgYxG4wsNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773904/cwelch_210809_4701_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otherwise it’s very similar to last year’s Z Fold 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PVh7xk"&gt;The Z Fold 3 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888, has 12GB of RAM, and comes in 256GB or 512GB storage configurations. Its three rear cameras are close to what was in the Fold 2: the f/1.8 wide, f/2.0 ultra-wide, and f/2.4 telephoto cameras still use 12-megapixel sensors and the apertures are unchanged. But the tele lens now features optical image stabilization. The 10MP camera on the cover screen is also the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Y5TlP"&gt;But there’s quite a change to the camera that’s on the Fold 3’s primary screen. Samsung has switched from a hole-punch selfie camera to an under-display camera. It’s not the first time we’ve seen such an approach; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617979/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-announced-under-display-camera-cup-specs-price"&gt;Xiaomi just yesterday announced&lt;/a&gt; a phone with an under-display camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aAdAF"&gt;Samsung’s got a 4-megapixel sensor beneath the screen’s pixels. That sounds measly for photos, but the purpose of this camera is really for video chats. The company says it’s perfectly adequate for Zoom calls and other videoconferencing, and 4MP is good enough to produce HD video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0uZEXIAL1p8orTp4RdCOHJ7qU9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775779/ZFOLD_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no missing the under-display camera if you look for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPGLa5nbrdYr_7gIMymosUaJXQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775788/ZFOLD_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it does a better job blending in when your eyes are focused elsewhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uR0ssg"&gt;But let’s just be up front about it: you can absolutely tell there’s a camera in there. Samsung says there are “minimum pixels applied on top of the camera hole,” and they’re extremely noticeable when you’re looking right at the circle. (It’s even more obvious in photos, so don’t be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; put off by the image below.) The point isn’t to completely hide the camera; it’s to make the display feel like an “unbroken canvas” when you’re using the phone. Focus on any other part of the screen, and the under-display camera sort of vanishes from view in a way that a hole-punch camera wouldn’t. It still seems like a lot of work for minimal payoff, but sometimes Samsung just likes to flex. Also, yes, the crease in the middle of the screen is still present. I find myself barely noticing it when the display is on, but it’s very much there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFYS-xmn2aq5btTOh9Oo4RvrEwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773900/cwelch_210809_4701_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung is confident the display can handle stylus input.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7zlYU"&gt;As for the S Pen, the stylus works on the Fold 3’s 7.6-inch primary screen — though oddly not the cover display, Samsung told me. The company developed a special “Fold Edition” S Pen that covers all the basics, and the more expensive S Pen Pro is also supported and adds air gestures and some Bluetooth tricks. (Both are sold separately from the Fold 3.) The S Pen Pro has a nifty toggle switch that you can flip when using the stylus with other Samsung devices; they apparently use a different frequency than the Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN1PLd"&gt;Both compatible S Pens have “a specially engineered retractable tip” that limits the force you can apply to the Fold 3’s screen. The screen protector might be 80 percent stronger, but it’s still delicate ultra-thin glass under there. Even so, I pressed down fairly hard during my hands-on time with the phone, and neither S Pen left any permanent line marks on the protective film. But I realize that’s not helpful for determining how the Fold 3 will hold up to a year or more of taking notes, sketching, editing PDFs, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlrS26qU2ytWFumU0g7-BPL0NOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773901/cwelch_210809_4701_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3 supports the Fold Edition S Pen and S Pen Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0aQDu2"&gt;Samsung seems determined to help Z Fold 3 owners do more with its spacious screen real estate — even in cases where app developers aren’t yet on board. A new Labs feature in settings lets you put any app into split-screen or pop-up view when multitasking. You can also customize an app’s aspect ratio. The company says it has polished up the multitasking gestures and is promising an experience that feels more cohesive and intuitive. You can now permanently pin your Edge Panel to the side of the screen like a dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEuNaZ97IGDaIQXWX_fVC1kIvuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773903/cwelch_210809_4701_0020.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="N4bzU7"&gt;Preorders for Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 start today and it’s available in three colors: black, green, and silver. The flagship foldable will go on sale August 27th alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 3, Galaxy Buds 2, and two new smartwatches that Samsung also introduced today. Stay tuned for our full review soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 announced with much bigger, more useful cover display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eduWjOCaMeCVpz_GBpyOQY_o_jc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709727/cwelch_210809_4701_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;What a difference a usable secondary screen can make&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jp5CFV"&gt;For all the multitasking prowess and sheer productivity potential Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; offers, there’s something about the just-announced Galaxy Z Flip 3 that’s got me even more excited. Maybe it’s the look: one of the colors is a fantastic cream hue that reminds me of vintage ‘70s gadgets. More likely, it’s the larger outer display that’s so much more practical and useful than the teeny, tiny cover display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;on the original Flip&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an it factor about this phone that I can’t put my finger on. Honestly, there’s just a feeling of &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; to the Flip 3 — right down to the stylish cases Samsung is making for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ybxJ2"&gt;A lower price is certainly part of the appeal: the Galaxy Z Flip 3 starts at $999, bringing Samsung’s foldables down below the $1,000 mark (without discounts) for the first time. That’ll get you 128GB storage and 8GB of RAM. Like the much pricier Fold 3, the Flip 3 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888, has robust 5G support, and is IPX8 water resistant — so it can survive a swim. Like last year, Samsung is including a pair of wide and ultrawide rear cameras around back. Both are 12-megapixel sensors, with the standard camera offering an f/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization, and the ability to record HDR10+ video. Digital zoom tops out at 10x, so you’re not getting the extended “space zoom” capabilities of the S21 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WE-15X7mD6EOAfeTGJ80Od5eXyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773884/cwelch_210809_4701_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3’s primary screen now tops out at a smoother 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aLU7M9"&gt;The primary 6.7-inch, 22:9 display has been upgraded from 60Hz and now has a smoother 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that adjusts automatically to optimize battery life. There’s still a selfie camera cutout at the top of the screen; Samsung switched to an under-display camera on the Fold 3, but kept things simpler here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnY7rb"&gt;On both phones, the company has made durability improvements to the protective film that covers the ultra-thin glass. In the case of the Flip 3, Samsung says it’s 30 percent stronger. That could lead to fewer blemishes and indentations on the screen protector. But hopefully it’ll also mean fewer phones that break unexpectedly from perfectly normal, daily use — a frustration experienced by some owners of the original Flip and Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXzvpXH_RmM6k8pub0w6H6JpKc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773888/cwelch_210809_4701_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung is selling some fun cases for the Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiPRXm5_Bjo5GCPSOUc4nAYKdSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773890/cwelch_210809_4701_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, the crease is still evident when the display is off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aby4E4"&gt;A smoother primary display is certainly a welcome improvement, but the most critical upgrade to the Z Flip 3 is that outer cover screen. It’s now four times larger than the small oval that was of such little use on the original Z Flip. This time you’ve got more room. More room for widgets (music, calendar, timer, weather, etc.) and more room for checking notifications: Samsung says the cover screen can show several lines of text. Clearly Samsung has taken some lessons from Motorola’s Razr foldable here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ7fDz"&gt;In fact, the cover screen is now big enough that you can use it as a viewfinder when taking selfies. Samsung says it can be used for video recording and vlogs, but to me that would be pushing it. You can also access Android’s quick settings or use Samsung Pay from the cover display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2EbG-bY5V9eWt18OKDos1SQweGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773887/cwelch_210809_4701_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cover screen is now four times larger and way more useful as a result.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ubQPf"&gt;Expanding the size of that outer screen makes the whole concept of the Z Flip 3 so much more appealing to me. It feels like Samsung has made enough refinements that you’ll be able to pull the folded phone out of your pocket, respond to a notification or text without having to open it, and tuck it back away. It lends the phone’s purpose more legitimacy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDMTpPKrcJIjkLtcYaBZFf1oVXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773891/cwelch_210809_4701_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHnr4G"&gt;Other upgrades to the Z Flip 3 that aren’t so obvious at first glance include new stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos audio. And Samsung says the Flip 3’s “Flex Mode” — activated when the phone is partially folded — will put media like videos or album art at the top half and automatically relocate controls to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xqnd3E"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is being offered in seven colors: cream, green, purple, black, gray, white, and pink; the latter three are exclusively available from Samsung’s website. Preorders start today, and the phone will be available in stores on August 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
