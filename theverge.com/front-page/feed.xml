    <title>The founder of Facebook’s CrowdTangle tool is leaving</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vR9bZ"&gt;Brandon Silverman, the founder and CEO of the Facebook-owned analytics tool CrowdTangle, is leaving the company, according to an internal farewell post to colleagues posted Wednesday that was seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAXuxg"&gt;His departure comes as Facebook is under pressure to publicly share more data about the content that spreads on its service. CrowdTangle, a free tool that lets anyone track popular posts across Facebook and Instagram, is at the center of that debate. In recent years, it has been used to show that far-right personalities are regularly the most engaged-with accounts on Facebook. That irritated some Facebook executives who felt that the data being shared by CrowdTangle was incomplete, and earlier this year, the CrowdTangle team was disbanded as a standalone team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuHsqY"&gt;Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne confirmed Silverman’s departure and said it would have “no change on day-to-day functioning of the CrowdTangle product experience.” He added that Silverman left “day-to-day management” of CrowdTangle after it was moved into Facebook’s broader Integrity organization a couple of months ago “as part of a growing suite of transparency resources,” such as the company’s ads library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5raMRq"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle"&gt;bought CrowdTangle in 2016&lt;/a&gt; as it was courting media companies to post more on its News Feed, and the tool is still used to track viral posts on the social network. “You don’t do this work because you’re looking for some specific outcome our credibility or legitimacy or trust, but because so many public interest orgs simply need this data to do their work,” Silverman said in his farewell post to employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yr7hkV"&gt;“I’m not sure what the future holds for CrowdTangle or data transparency here at Facebook, but I’m optimistic,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijY3n9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeNMtK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve opens up a Steam Deck to explain why it thinks you shouldn’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The inside of a Steam Deck." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WNO1MjuN_PRE7_T6yKYTMQZMc-U=/151x0:1768x1078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960594/bdddb89899430cef189a44098fca1d4ec2f9512f.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghmMYo"&gt;Valve has posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnr2FAADAs"&gt;an official teardown&lt;/a&gt; of its upcoming handheld gaming PC, the Steam Deck. Before diving into the teardown, though, the company spends about a minute to strongly caution against taking one apart unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSwVON"&gt;“Even though it’s your PC — or it will be once you’ve received your Steam Deck — and you have every right to open it up and do what you want, we at Valve really don’t recommend that you ever open it up,” a Valve representative said in the video. “The Steam Deck is a very tightly designed system, and the parts are chosen carefully for this product with its specific construction, so they aren’t really designed to be user-swappable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The inside of a Steam Deck." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m44kPZk0fhkyUFFQ4wf3r7v1MeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905537/bdddb89899430cef189a44098fca1d4ec2f9512f.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of a Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TxSsaG"&gt;Despite its warnings, however, the company likely understands that people are going to take the Steam Deck apart anyway, so this video could be a handy resource for people who are considering doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hogvWm"&gt;In the video, Valve shows how to swap out two parts of the system. First, Valve shows how to replace the thumbsticks. The company cautions that they are completely custom, but says that it will offer a source for “replacement parts, thumbsticks, SSDs, and possibly more” in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5OyXx"&gt;After that, Valve shows how to swap out the SSD, which could be helpful for people who may have reserved the cheapest version of the device with an eMMC hard drive with the intention of upgrading it themselves. Be aware that all versions of the Steam Deck use an m.2 connector, including the version with the eMMC drive, so if you plan to make a swap, you’re going to have to reinstall the OS and bring over any games you might have had loaded on your other drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns3oUZ"&gt;Valve says the Steam Deck will begin shipping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, though the initial reservations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582617/new-steam-deck-reservations-q2-q3-valve-hand-held"&gt;flew off the virtual shelves quickly&lt;/a&gt;. If you reserve one now, you’ll have to wait until at least the second quarter of 2022 for the opportunity to actually make an order. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is making it easier to delete accounts attached to third-party apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxUHuOO390QMUu-AQFuGQ-31_kw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960516/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqpUG8"&gt;Apple will require developers that offer a way to create accounts in their apps to also offer a way to delete them, starting with app submissions on January 31st, 2022, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo"&gt;the company shared Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The account deletion requirement was originally announced alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;several other changes to Apple’s developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WWdtz"&gt;Account deletion is a minor convenience, but considering how often apps require accounts and how easy it is to delete an app without ending your relationship with the company connected to it, it’s welcome. Apple’s announcement suggests only that developers “allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app,” so it’s possible implementations of these account deletion features could bump you to a browser during some part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hb1xPI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Free yourself from third-party accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1HbSp"&gt;Apple has also &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul"&gt;confirmed the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of its more prominent app reporting tool &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;that was spotted on iOS a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the “Report a Problem” button is available on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and also macOS Monterey once it’s released. The button allows users to report scams or offensive, abusive, and illegal content — even for apps they haven’t purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IkTIs"&gt;Apple’s made other recent tweaks to the App Store — like allowing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;the company’s own apps to be reviewed&lt;/a&gt; — but for a full look at all of the changes the company has made to its storefront over time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;check out our article running them down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly slows feature development for ‘reputational reviews’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TRG3g7fdx3pE1XLACuYZr4WBDUc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960457/acastro_180319_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OfOEy7"&gt;Facebook is slowing down the release and development of some new products and features to make sure they won’t bring more scrutiny towards the company or harm children, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-slows-new-products-for-reputational-reviews-11633535983?page=1"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The “reputational reviews” come as Facebook is facing backlash from the public and policymakers after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;a wave of reports&lt;/a&gt; citing Facebook’s own research showing ways Instagram could have a negative effect on teen girls’ mental health. Facebook was also slammed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;in congressional hearings&lt;/a&gt; by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shed more light on Facebook’s internal research, as well as its business model and algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYePuo"&gt;Some of Facebook’s recent public actions and statements back up the idea that it’s being extra careful right now. In late September, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;announced it’s “pausing” work&lt;/a&gt; on a version of Instagram made for preteens, citing concerns (including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;those raised&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting) that the public had about the project. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;In a Tuesday Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; responding to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;the whistleblower’s testimony before Congress&lt;/a&gt;, Mark Zuckerberg said the company’s leaders would be doing “deep dives” on its current work to get a clearer picture of how Facebook is trying to make “important contributions across safety, integrity, research, and product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FPvor6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zuckerberg pushed back against the whistleblower and WSJ in his post&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yG5EhO"&gt;Facebook has also pushed back against the recent reporting around it and against the claims made by Frances Haugen. In the post mentioned above, Zuckerberg called parts of her testimony “deeply illogical” and said that &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting mischaracterized Facebook’s research (echoing Instagram lead &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;Adam Mosseri’s comments&lt;/a&gt;).  Facebook also claimed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;banned a group of ad transparency and misinformation researchers’ access&lt;/a&gt; to its platform because they improperly scraped data, a justification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612545/facebook-banned-third-party-researchers-inaccurate-says-ftc"&gt;which the FTC called “inaccurate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V24IoS"&gt;The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about added reviews during product and feature development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="boDoB4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook runs the coward’s playbook to smear the whistleblower","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"},{"title":"What’s good, bad, and missing in the Facebook whistleblower’s testimony","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Bw8Wzj"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Facebook is examining its internal research that could be potentially damaging if it made its way to the public, according to some of the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. This lines up with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/technology/facebook-instagram-teenagers.html"&gt;a recent report from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which noted that Facebook’s legal team had contacted a researcher about a past report and that another researcher was told by their manager to not run any queries that could appear suspicious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vMrqyW"&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s whistleblower report confirms what researchers have known for years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/70T0yOLoTaZRmclEMQIMyrrbB8Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69960215/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7t7smo"&gt;For weeks, Facebook has stared down mounting anxiety over a leaked internal study about the harmful effects of Instagram on teenage girls — and Tuesday night, Mark Zuckerberg finally responded to the scandal personally. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;In an open letter to Facebook staff&lt;/a&gt;, Zuckerberg scoffed at concerns raised by whistleblower Frances Haugen, doubling down on earlier Facebook claims that the report has been misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFlHHv"&gt;“If we’re going to have an informed conversation about the effects of social media on young people, it’s important to start with a full picture,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We’re committed to doing more research ourselves and making more research publicly available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RK8LGq"&gt;But for researchers who study social media, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;internal study&lt;/a&gt; that sparked the controversy was mostly confirmation of what they already knew — that Instagram makes teen girls feel worse about their bodies, and that they blame the platform for anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xcjR0"&gt;Megan Moreno, principal investigator of the Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says Haugen’s interpretation of the internal research squares perfectly with other work done on social media, especially Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X998Ow"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I didn’t feel like it was tremendously surprising”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3PITK5"&gt;“For a certain population of youth, exposure to this content can be associated with diminished body image, or body image concerns,” Moreno says. “I didn’t feel like it was tremendously surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCB1Jt"&gt;In fact, social media researchers have spent around ten years gathering evidence on how teen body image is affected by social media. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X15002249"&gt;Studies regularly find&lt;/a&gt; that teen and preteen girls who use Facebook, for example, are less satisfied with their bodies and do more self-objectification. &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2013.0305"&gt;One 2014 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of around 100 middle and high school girls showed that those who spent more time with Facebook photos had more weight dissatisfaction and more of a drive to be thin. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272431613501083?journalCode=jeaa"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found that girls who spent more time online and on social media were more likely to diet. More recent studies on Instagram show similar findings: female college students were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144518301360"&gt;less satisfied with their bodies&lt;/a&gt; after seeing Instagram images of thin body types. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1740144516300936"&gt;A 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; of that same demographic showed that seeing images of peers and celebrities from Instagram led to more body dissatisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42Go5V"&gt;Facebook has defended itself by pointing out that Instagram makes other teens feel better about themselves — but that’s also been duplicated by other studies, and not all the researchers find it reassuring. Teens who are confident in themselves already might not be negatively affected by Instagram, Moreno says, or it may help their self confidence — but kids who have lower self esteem are still vulnerable to the negative effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e2EOTU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UG2Brb"&gt;“The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer,” Moreno told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re acknowledging that the people you harmed were already at risk, that suggests you’re uniquely disabling people that are vulnerable, I’m not sure that argument suggests that you’re out for people’s best interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbVAnC"&gt;The findings fit into a larger body of work on &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213269.2010.525737"&gt;other forms of media&lt;/a&gt;, like reality television and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2016.1250702"&gt;magazines&lt;/a&gt;. Teen and adolescent girls who interact with that content also tend to say they’re more dissatisfied with their bodies. They’re also more likely to spend more time comparing themselves to others, and that type of social comparison is linked to anxiety and fears around the way they’re judged by others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WIG7oE"&gt;Social media, though, is unique in that users are seeing people they know. “There’s this sense that you’re comparing yourself to people that you’re connected to, in some way,” Moreno says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5jsxj"&gt;The Facebook data’s consistency with past research also makes it harder to explain away the findings, and cast doubt on the &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21072223-instagram-teen-annotated-research-deck-1"&gt;annotations&lt;/a&gt; Facebook made when it released the underlying report. The research appears from the published slides to be strong and carefully done, Moreno says. “The design is excellent,” she says. “Their study was designed in the way that I’ve seen many others designed, which again is I think a measure of its quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHKeyA"&gt;Facebook also argued that the data wasn’t representative of all Instagram users, that there were also findings about positive benefits from Instagram, and that the number of people surveyed in some cases was small. But while pointing out limitations is an important part of analyzing research data, the limitations here are similar to what might be seen in other studies, Moreno says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medtronic issues ‘urgent’ recall of insulin pump controller vulnerable to hacks</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1H03Kp"&gt;Medical device company Medtronic issued an &lt;a href="https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/customer-support/product-and-service-updates/notice16-letter"&gt;urgent recall&lt;/a&gt; of the remote controller for certain insulin pumps because they’re vulnerable to hacks. It’s possible for someone to copy the signals sent from the controllers to the pumps and deliver or block a dose of insulin, which could be dangerous for diabetic patients using the pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBiGa3"&gt;In the recall statement, Medtronic said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that it wasn’t aware of any situations where this type of hack has occurred. The company was first made aware of the issue in 2018 after an independent cybersecurity researcher found the vulnerability and told users about the problem. That initial alert told users how to disable the remote control feature when they weren’t using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njJtXa"&gt;Now, the company says people shouldn’t use the remotes. “After further review, Medtronic has determined that the potential risks associated with the MiniMed remote controller outweigh the benefits of its continued use,” it said in the recall alert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmRq47"&gt;Medtronic also put out &lt;a href="https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/customer-support/product-and-service-updates/notice11-letter"&gt;a safety notice&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 warning about the risk of hacks in the same set of insulin pumps, the MiniMed 508 insulin pump and the MiniMed Paradigm family of insulin pumps. The Food and Drug Administration also got involved and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-warns-patients-and-health-care-providers-about-potential-cybersecurity-concerns-certain"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that the agency was concerned about the potential for someone to hack into the pumps and change the dose of insulin delivered to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QefiVa"&gt;Experts have worried about the cybersecurity risks of insulin pumps for nearly a decade, since security researcher Jay Radcliffe &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/medtronic-security/medtronic-insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hackers-idUSN1E77O1VJ20110826"&gt;broke into his own Medtronic pump&lt;/a&gt; onstage at a conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeCeyP"&gt;As more and more medical devices are connected to the internet and healthcare becomes a bigger target for ransomware attacks, worries about things like insulin pumps, pacemakers, and other products have only grown. “There hasn’t been a really high-profile case of a patient being killed or seriously harmed, but it’s just a matter of time,” Mike Johnson, a securities technologies expert at the University of Minnesota’s Technological Leadership Institute, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686000/medical-device-cybersecurity-hack-minnesota"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in September. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA shuffles astronaut crew assignments amid ongoing Boeing delays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-BOEING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDy4JP8bm-UTfO26DEKsAnAi9-s=/0x107:4805x3310/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959929/1234021721.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqavii"&gt;Two NASA astronauts originally slated to launch on an upcoming flight of Boeing’s new Starliner spacecraft have been &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-astronaut-changes-for-upcoming-commercial-crew-missions"&gt;reassigned to an upcoming SpaceX flight instead&lt;/a&gt;, as delays continue to push back Starliner’s next flight to space. Astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada were supposed to be among the first human passengers on Starliner during its first crewed flights in the coming years. Now, they’ll fly together on SpaceX’s fifth crewed mission to the International Space Station, which is slated to take place in the fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adPtgS"&gt;Mann and Cassada were first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17647474/nasa-commercial-crew-astronuts-spacex-boeing-dragon-starliner"&gt;assigned to fly on Starliner in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Mann was supposed to fly on the Starliner’s first crewed test flight, along with Michael Fincke and Butch Wilmore — a critical test to prove that Starliner is safe to carry people. Cassada was slated to fly on the next flight after Mann’s, Starliner’s first official crewed mission, which also includes NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Jeanette Epps. Both Mann and Cassada are rookie astronauts, while many of the other Boeing flyers have been to space before, except for Epps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JDfiRS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s unclear when any of these Starliner missions will take place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0VNFXX"&gt;However, it’s unclear when any of these Starliner missions will take place, as Boeing is still working on a valve problem with the spacecraft. With no end in sight for the fix, NASA seemingly shuffled around crew assignments so that Mann and Cassada could get their first taste of space sooner rather than later. “Nicole and Josh have done a tremendous job pioneering the training and path forward for astronauts to fly on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft,” Kathy Lueders, associate administrator of the space operations at NASA, said in a statement. “They have gained experience that they will take forward as they train to fly in SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and serve aboard the International Space Station.” The reassignment was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/nasa-likely-to-move-some-astronauts-off-starliner-due-to-extended-delays/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g7MhILEhfBF-WoUOyvycas9Y7AE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905253/mann_cassada.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek7zix"&gt;Starliner is a Boeing-built spacecraft, designed to take passengers to and from the International Space Station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The vehicle is one of two made for the program; the other is SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, which launched its first crew of astronauts in May 2020. As part of the development process, NASA wanted each company to launch its vehicle on an uncrewed test flight, followed by a test flight with crew on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4p0T1"&gt;So far, Starliner has only flown once without passengers on board, and its debut flight did not go to plan. During its launch, the spacecraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;suffered multiple software glitches&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately prevented the vehicle from reaching the orbit it needed to achieve to meet up with the International Space Station. Boeing was able to bring the spacecraft back to Earth safely, but NASA launched an investigation into the flight, coming up with a total of 80 corrective actions the agency wanted Boeing to take before proceeding. NASA and Boeing agreed that the company would get a do-over mission, in which Starliner would launch again without people on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5uemM"&gt;However, it’s still an open question when that redo will take place. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing hoped to fly a passenger-less Starliner again this summer&lt;/a&gt; and even got as close as stacking the spacecraft on top of an Atlas V rocket on the launchpad. But the launch had to be postponed just hours before liftoff after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;Boeing discovered issues with some of Starliner’s propulsion valves&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the company took Starliner off its rocket and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623609/boeing-starliner-capsule-iss-launch-valve-troubleshooting-delay"&gt;transported it back to the factory&lt;/a&gt; to take a deeper look. There hasn’t been a solid update on when the issue will be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5nIi2"&gt;“We understand the agency’s need to make adjustments to get members of the current astronaut class flying experience on an operational vehicle while the development of the Starliner spacecraft continues,” Boeing said of the astronaut reassignment in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We fully support NASA’s decisions and remain committed to putting the safety of the astronauts who will fly on our vehicle first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYiPuo"&gt;Meanwhile, SpaceX successfully completed its test flights with Crew Dragon and has already conducted two full passenger missions to the space station, launching a total of 10 astronauts to the ISS. The company’s next mission, called Crew-3, is slated for takeoff on October 30th. SpaceX is also slated to bring home its second group of passengers, Crew-2, from the space station in mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHSV1p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo will reveal Animal Crossing’s next big update on October 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwBHHXSObM0pfO9CYMvXt9FZGog=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959874/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_OnlinePlay_SCRN_02_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mLg2J7"&gt;Like the &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; Direct before it, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is getting its own showcase coming October 15th. The &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account revealed the news, promising 20 minutes of updates and announcements of what to expect for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195022/animal-crossing-switch-sales-japan-famitsu"&gt;Nintendo’s bucolic hit of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z5zSsb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;[Announcement]&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimalCrossing&lt;/a&gt;: New Horizons Direct will air on Oct. 15 at 7am PT! Tune in for roughly 20 minutes of information about the content coming to Animal Crossing: New Horizons in November. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ACNH?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ACNH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gc7rfFoxpk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gc7rfFoxpk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Isabelle (@animalcrossing) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1445750713619943428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXOJrc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; has been in a bit of a new-content dearth. While seasonal items used to spruce up villagers’ islands are added regularly, new events have been a bit slower to roll out. This year, we’ve seen three new events: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250249/animal-crossing-new-horizon-nintendo-switch-festivale-update"&gt;Festivale party&lt;/a&gt; that happened in January, and May Day and National Museum Day, which both took place in May. To keep players occupied with new shinies, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; featured tons of crossover events featuring &lt;a href="https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/news/#!/free-update-for-animal-crossing-new-horizons-delivers-new-content"&gt;Sanrio characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288246/animal-crossing-new-horizons-mario-update"&gt;Mario items&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqvGad"&gt;This new update, scheduled for November, seems to contain the much-anticipated café. In previous Animal Crossings, the café was a place to casually chat with villagers during their off-hours while also letting players work in exchange for coffee beans and furniture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOHSVg"&gt;New Horizons Direct takes place October 15th at 10 AM EST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jWB5K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCRQw9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halide’s latest update brings the iPhone 13 Pro’s Macro Mode to older iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzUynfgZ0Yy2u-5dFqIZcRbXLGk=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959756/macro_mode_halide.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Halide&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFyEUx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide/id885697368"&gt;Halide&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best photography apps on the iPhone, and the company has just updated its app with a new macro feature, designed to perfectly complement the new macro mode that Apple added with this year’s iPhone 13 Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlozy"&gt;But Halide’s 2.5 update doesn’t just add support for the iPhone 13 Pro’s existing macro feature that Apple made. It takes things a step further and adds a macro mode for older iPhones, too, using Apple’s Neural Engine for “AI-based detail enhancement,” which uses a neural network to squeeze extra detail out of the close-up shot, even when you crop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iK9cub"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10792972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iAwKxX"&gt;The “official” macro mode on the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max uses the new ultra-wide lens that Apple offers on its more premium models, which — unlike the ultra-wide on the regular iPhone 13 models or older iPhones — add an auto-focus mode that makes the ultra-close up photography possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBeYID"&gt;Halide is mimicking that effect in two ways: first, it determines what camera lens on your device can focus the closest, and then the app offers “sub-millimeter” focus control to get the perfect shot. Then, it uses the aforementioned “Neural Macro” feature to upscale the image, allowing for sharp photos even when cropped in by 2x or 3x. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3O4TRY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not quite as good as the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s a fun tool to try&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LgNRc"&gt;To use Macro Mode in Halide, you’ll first need to update your version of the app to Halide 2.5 from the App Store. Then, tap the “AF” button to toggle off autofocus, which brings up the manual focus menu, where you’ll be able to tap a new flower icon to enable Macro Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npllIL"&gt;I was able to briefly test out a beta of the new update on my iPhone 12 Pro, and the results are pretty impressive. It’s still not quite on the level of the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro capabilities — there are still limits to what the older hardware is physically capable of doing — but it’s certainly a better solution than simply holding your phone close to your subject and hoping for the best and a fun tool to play around with. And while I don’t have an iPhone 13 Pro handy to test with further, Halide says that its Macro Mode enhances that feature for even better macro shots, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15mnFcycsVzK9vyP6wWxBWm6vo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22905014/IMG_3350.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9MbsQ"&gt;The new Macro Mode addition works on any iPhone that offers Apple’s Neural Engine (which includes the iPhone 8 and all subsequent releases) and is a free update for Halide owners. Halide itself can be downloaded for free from the App Store with a seven-day free trial and can be purchased for either $2.99 per month or $11.99 per year subscriptions or a flat $ 49.99-lifetime price upfront. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chevy Silverado EV will debut at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logos Of The World" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bwf2pKDr7Y3xdU-parpv9klQcJU=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959711/1188353086.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JJQY37"&gt;General Motors will debut the all-electric Chevy Silverado at the 2022 Consumer Electronics show in January in Las Vegas, Nevada, as part of CEO Mary Barra’s opening keynote address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1ugbo"&gt;The Silverado EV will be the second electric truck announced by GM, following the pickup version of the resurrected Hummer. The Silverado is one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s much larger push into electric vehicles — an effort that GM described in greater detail on Wednesday during an investor event where it also announced a new version of its hands-free driver assistance system. It will be the first electric truck for the Chevy brand, though, and it’s sort of fitting that it will debut at CES, considering that the production Bolt EV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10725182/chevrolet-bolt-electric-car-ces-2016"&gt;revealed there in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bn78m"&gt;The Silverado EV will be built on the same Ultium battery pack and electric drivetrain that GM is using to power the Hummer, the Cadillac Lyriq, and multiple other vehicles. The company claims that will let the electric Silverado travel more than 400 miles on a full charge. It will be sold in both consumer and fleet versions, much like the Ford F-150 Lightning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srxw5H"&gt;GM announced Wednesday that all-wheel steering will be an option for the Silverado EV, as well as a “fixed-glass roof,” which it teased in a photo. While it’s not as expansive as the all-glass roof on Tesla’s cars, or Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, it’s much bigger than a typical moonroof and hopefully won’t give GM some of the same adhesion problems that those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696482/ford-mustang-mach-e-glass-windshield-recall-roof"&gt;other companies have dealt with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y871J2"&gt;Otherwise, not too much is known about Chevy’s first mass-market electric truck, including when it will be on the market. GM has already made some big promises around its Ultium generation of electric vehicles, even while it struggles with its first generation thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677539/chevy-bolt-recall-gm-electric-vehicles-fire-tesla-competition"&gt;massive recall of the Bolt EV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
