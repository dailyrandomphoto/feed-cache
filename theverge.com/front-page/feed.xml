    <title>TikTok adds automatic captions to videos in accessibility push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiAbwm0TUAd5NniZTkYZs9eyjL8=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69082469/image__5_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creators will have the option of editing captions once they’ve been generated.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Idgne"&gt;TikTok creators will soon be able to &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-auto-captions"&gt;add automatically-generated captions&lt;/a&gt; to their videos as the app attempts to make itself more accessible. The option to add auto captions will appear in the editing page after a video has been uploaded or recorded. TikTok says the feature will be available in American English and Japanese at first, but that it plans to add support for more languages “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKlq90"&gt;The platform is adding the feature to make TikTok videos easier to watch for deaf and hard of hearing viewers. However, a TikTok dialogue box also says the feature is useful for anyone watching videos “when it’s difficult or inconvenient for them to listen to audio.” Creators can edit their captions after they’ve been automatically generated to fix any mistakes, and viewers can turn captions off via the captions button on the share panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V7WTnk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok plans to add support for more languages “in the coming months”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RvoSg8"&gt;As automatic-transcription has gotten better over the years, services have increasingly been adding it to their software to make content more accessible. Last month, Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/live-caption-chrome/"&gt;built the feature into Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to generate captions for audio played through the browser. The company’s Live Caption system is also available as a system-wide feature for &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en-GB#:~:text=Live%20Caption%20works%20in%20English,and%20selected%20other%20Android%20phones.&amp;amp;text=When%20Live%20Caption%20is%20turned,media%20playing%20on%20your%20device."&gt;select Android devices&lt;/a&gt;. Video chat services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9300310?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt; can auto-generate captions during calls, and Instagram also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1369351891445030918?"&gt;seems to be testing&lt;/a&gt; a similar feature for its videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXiKIc"&gt;TikTok’s auto captions are only its latest accessibility feature. The app also warns creators about videos that &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy"&gt;might trigger photosensitive epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; and provides filters for viewers to avoid these videos. A text-to-speech feature was also &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-au/refreshing-our-policies-to-support-community-wellbeing-au"&gt;added late last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to check if you’re part of the Facebook data breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3-r8N_92l9QQADIYqkgUciFza8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076936/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ElKllT"&gt;By now, you have probably heard of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366822/facebook-personal-data-533-million-leaks-online-email-phone-numbers"&gt;the huge Facebook data breach&lt;/a&gt;, in which upwards of 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries had personal data leaked online, including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, birthdates — you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxRycs"&gt;Your first question will be, of course, how to check whether you are part of that breach. There are a couple of places out there where you can find out whether your data has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkMEo3"&gt;One well-known site that tracks data breaches is &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt;. Just follow the link to the site and put in your email address or phone number. You will find out not only if you’ve been part of the Facebook breach, but also any other breaches in which your data may have been compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkw7yg"&gt;Troy Hunt, creator of Have I Been Pwned, was considering whether to include a phone number search (as this comes with certain privacy risks), but ultimately decided to add the feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zqQUbx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Should the FB phone numbers be searchable in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt;? I’m thinking through the pros and cons in terms of the value it adds to impacted people versus the risk presented if it’s used to help resolve numbers to identities (you’d still need the source data to do that).&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378503918284460035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYiCcI"&gt;Another tool for checking your phone number against the leaked Facebook database (suggested by &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-to-check-if-your-phone-number-is-in-the-huge-facebo-1846617849"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is a site called &lt;a href="https://www.thenewseachday.com/facebook-phone-numbers-us"&gt;The News Each Day&lt;/a&gt;, in which you input your phone number to find out whether it’s part of the breach. However, that site is not as well-known, so until more is known about it, you may want to stick with the more trusted site listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8Ngp9"&gt;And if you do find out that your data has been compromised? Some of the steps you can take are to change the passwords of compromised sites, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;use a password manager&lt;/a&gt; so that you can create and track unique passwords for each site (so that if one is compromised, it won’t affect any others), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;use two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; for additional security, and stay alert for news of any other breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43SYA8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Tuesday April 6th, 7:51AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated the story to note that &lt;/em&gt;Have I Been Pwned &lt;em&gt;now also lets you search for your phone number in the Facebook data breach. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yelp is making it easier for users to search for Asian-owned businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ft2OVyyY-AhCB_Gn11a9bZGioNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69082326/akrales_180411_2467_0070.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vUROOt"&gt;Yelp is rolling out a new tool that will allow businesses the option to identify themselves as Asian-owned, chief diversity officer Miriam Warren announced today. The new optional attribute will make it easier for Yelp users to find and support Asian-owned businesses easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvq950"&gt;Business owners will be allowed to edit their existing listing on Yelp and select the attribute that notes they are an Asian-owned business. The feature will be available when a business owner logs in to their Yelp for Business account. Once enabled, users who filter by “Asian owned” restaurants will find a list of businesses near their location that have self-selected that attribute. Yelp previously rolled out similar attributes for businesses to display, such as the option to identify as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281887/yelp-new-search-tool-black-owned-businesses-app-donation-matching"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/michelle-cheng/yelp-search-women-owned-businesses.html"&gt;women-owned&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5fwG_mN0EXySZAIBv1YUsKK77U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416771/Yelp_for_Business_App_Selecting_Asian_owned_Attribute.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Yelp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yelp for Business will allow owners to enable the Asian-owned attribute. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpnyd1"&gt;Yelp also confirmed in its &lt;a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/diverse-business-report"&gt;latest Economic Impact Report on diverse businesses&lt;/a&gt; that searches on Yelp for Asian-owned businesses increased by 130 percent in February. The company also said that, during the months of April and May, the Yelp Foundation will double match any donations a Yelp employee makes to selections that are Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving, such as &lt;a href="https://www.advancingjustice-atlanta.org/"&gt;Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stopaapihate.org/"&gt;Stop AAPI Hate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel 5 reportedly gets big GPU performance boost with new update</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g6tbQ4"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/105130965?hl=en"&gt;started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; the April Android security update for Pixel phones, and it looks like it’s brought some performance improvements to the most recent devices. Google says the update includes “performance optimizations for certain graphics-intensive apps and games” on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and, as &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-5-massive-gpu-performance-gains-april-2021-update/"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some testers are noticing substantially improved GPU performance on the Pixel 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl9kak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;previously &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16442/the-google-pixel-5-a-minireview/3"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the Pixel 5 turned in much worse GPU results than other phones using the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip. Now, the site’s reviewer Andrei Frumusanu &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1379143336943058952"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that performance on his Pixel 5 has been “essentially doubled” from the review’s initial figures and is now “in line or better than other 765G phones.” Benchmarks don’t necessarily translate into real-world results, of course, but combined with Google’s reference to optimizations for graphics-intensive apps, it does sound like GPU performance should be better with the new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJpZXV"&gt;In addition, Google says that the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G should receive “improvements to camera quality” in some third-party apps. There’s also a fix for a startup freezing bug on Pixel 4 and 5 devices, as well as one for missing home grid settings on the Pixel 3 and 4 generations of phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The long overdue Apple TV refresh may offer 120Hz support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77g2c5m5yj_buMEQU2PmaZt4R9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69081252/akrales_170919_1976_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vSzAlX"&gt;The Apple TV 4K hasn’t been updated for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017"&gt;more than three and a half years&lt;/a&gt;, which is an eternity in technology. But &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/05/tvos-14-5-beta-code-suggests-120hz-support-coming-to-a-new-apple-tv-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new tvOS 14.5 beta references support for 120Hz refresh rates — a capability that no currently available Apple TV models have — which could indicate Apple is working on a new version of its set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFM1DX"&gt;While it’s not clear what Apple may use a 120Hz refresh rate for in a new Apple TV, one of the more intriguing possibilities is for smoother gaming, like what’s offered with 120Hz support on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Apple has been showing increased interest in gaming as of late, so it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if the new Apple TV had more gaming-focused features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni0cS9"&gt;For example, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad"&gt;just added&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of new games to its Apple Arcade gaming subscription service, which lets you play games on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV and carry your progress across platforms. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;the iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/macos-big-sur-113-adds-fixes-for-ios-apps-on-desktop-support-for-ps5-and-xsx-pads"&gt;macOS 11.3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1612241720"&gt;tvOS 14.5 betas&lt;/a&gt; also all include support for the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller and the Xbox Series X controller — presumably, that support will carry over to the final software releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3a7Zc"&gt;The rumored 120Hz support for Apple TV would also line up with a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from December&lt;/a&gt;, which said Apple was working on a new Apple TV for sometime this year with a “stronger gaming focus.” (That report also said the new set-top box would have a redesigned remote, which will hopefully be easier to use.) While we don’t know exactly when Apple will announce this rumored device, or if it will announce it at all, if you’re in the market for a new Apple TV, you might want to wait just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US government will pay you up to $500,000 to design a less annoying face mask </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XwtLje0nixN-XOkSgsl20xgvbfc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69081043/acastro_200512_1777_faceMask_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGLgK4"&gt;Over a year into the pandemic, we’ve seen a wide variety of masks, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21318991/etsy-mesh-masks-coronavirus-poor-protection"&gt;totally unsafe fashion pieces&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;RGB nightmares&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention a bunch of other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22174639/masks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19"&gt;stylish options&lt;/a&gt;. But if you think you might have an idea for a better mask that more people might want to wear, the US government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) &lt;a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/mask-innovation-challenge/"&gt;has announced a competition&lt;/a&gt; to design “the next generation of masks” — with a potential $500,000 total prize waiting for the winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR33zk"&gt;The Mask Innovation Challenge was created in partnership with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH, an organization under the CDC) to address some of the common complaints leveled at masks, like the fact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21301830/face-mask-glasses-fogging-how-to-stop-clear"&gt;they can fog up glasses&lt;/a&gt;, irritate your skin, become uncomfortable to wear, get in the way of communication, and potentially let COVID-19 particles in through the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QNgjcD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Masks may stick around even after everyone’s vaccinated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="plMKIp"&gt;The contest will have two phases. The first phase, focused on “design,” is split into two tracks, one that considers redesigns of existing masks, and another that’s focused on new technologies and materials. Submissions are supposed to include actual schematics for building the proposed masks, which NIOSH says may be tested in the future as well. Phase One will produce up to 10 winners, each of whom will receive $10,000 to help build a prototype of their masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTK3Du"&gt;The second “proof-of-concept” phase will require contestants to respond to a hypothetical scenario with a brand-new mask design, not based on any existing mask. Phase two entrants will submit physical prototypes of their masks for NIOSH to test. Up to five winners from phase two will split a total prize pool of $400,000. NIOSH and BARDA say more details on the second phase will be available at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi3oyx"&gt;Holding a design contest to find a “better” mask could produce some real solutions, but beyond that, I think it reflects &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/24/will-masks-become-the-new-normal-even-after-the-pandemic-has-passed-some-americans-say-so-.html"&gt;the increased role masks may play&lt;/a&gt; in our lives, even after a majority of people are vaccinated. And that’s not to say that the masks you may already own aren’t effective; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html"&gt;they are&lt;/a&gt;. There are really multiple problems getting in the way of mask use; addressing complaints in mask design is one direction, but another big issue is availability. Masks manufacturers aren’t yet able to consistently meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgW9ya"&gt;For instance, it’s still not as easy as it should be to get N95s and KN95s, two frequently recommended masks that offer a step up in filtration from cloth varieties. There’s a lot at play here too; the long term effects of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decades-offshoring-led-mask-shortage-pandemic/"&gt;offshoring medical supplies manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; have impacted availability, but so have shortages of key mask making materials &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/covid-n95-medical-mask-shortage-manufacturing/"&gt;like meltblown textile&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also the separate issue of counterfeit masks. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 60 percent of KN95s in the US aren’t as effective at filtering COVID-19 particles as their labels might indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReZDpA"&gt;The Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22240453/joe-biden-defense-production-act-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;has set plans into motion&lt;/a&gt; to force the creation of more essential pandemic supplies and alleviate some of these issues, but it’s important to remember that building a better mask is just one facet of a much larger strategy. There’s no guarantee more people will wear the winning masks just because they don’t fog up their glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLN2Y1"&gt;The deadline for submission to phase one of &lt;a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/mask-innovation-challenge/"&gt;the Mask Innovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt; is April 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flight Penguin is a new flight search Chrome app that promises ‘no collusion’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIcf7nLy-zJBBC-yjntUfKO-Pu0=/204x0:963x506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69081000/33t687fbfzy4vdol.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4mY874"&gt;The founders of Hipmunk are launching a new startup today that’s aimed squarely at taking on their own former product. Called &lt;a href="https://flightpenguin.com/"&gt;Flight Penguin&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a Chrome browser extension that simultaneously searches a bunch of airline websites and then presents the results in a familiar format. Rather than taking a commission or affiliate fee, Flight Penguin will instead charge its users $10 per month — it’s designed for people who travel a lot (or, since there’s still a pandemic on, people who will imminently travel a lot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGhJMw"&gt;Flight Penguin is also not pulling any punches when it comes to its rhetoric: it promises that there will be “no collusion” with the airline industry, specifically noting that “Some of the largest travel sites hide flights from you in exchange for special favors from airlines.” The site is also gunning for Kayak, saying it will put that search “on ice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Azebjx"&gt;Hipmunk was a beloved site for travelers in its day, making it easy to compare flight costs across different airlines. Flight Penguin’s spiky stance toward other travel sites and toward the airline industry itself is likely meant to appeal to the people who used the travel site before it was shut down last year. The stance also positions Flight Penguin as a kind of super tool for travelers in the know — at launch users will have to sign up for a waitlist to even try it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJELmV"&gt;To use Flight Penguin, you click on the extension in your Chrome browser tool bar and enter your search terms — it can handle one-way and round-trip searches for now. Hit enter, and you’ll watch a timer wheel spin for a minute or so. While that wheel spins, the extension is searching airline sites for you in the background and then organizing the results. You can sort by price, timing, or by “pain” — Flight Penguin’s term for a mix of characteristics like price, layovers, timing, etc. At launch, Flight Penguin will also let you search for flights you can pay for with Chase rewards points. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3JpJ8kA1YldjkAFSKhebPYjIuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422984/unnamed.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClytRL"&gt;In some sample searches during a demo, I saw some results that wouldn’t have been likely to appear on other flight search sites — including results from airlines I didn’t expect and results that mixed airlines that typically wouldn’t go together. In a search trying to go from Oakland to Shreveport, for example, it came up with an itinerary that combined Sprit and Allegiant which was significantly cheaper than other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJS5VX"&gt;Adam Goldstein and Steve Huffman (better known &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155845/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-tiktok-privacy-concerns-spyware-fingerprinting-tracking-users"&gt;now as the CEO of Reddit&lt;/a&gt;) are the only two investors — both were founders of Hipmunk back in the day. Goldstein left Hipmunk in 2018 some time after it was purchased by Concur, which shut down the &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sap-concur-shuts-down-travel-search-engine-hipmunk/"&gt;consumer version of Hipmunk just before the pandemic hit last year&lt;/a&gt;. The entire Flight Penguin team consists of three people — the extension itself is largely coded by another Hipmunk expat, Sheri Zada. “I don’t need this to be a huge company,” Goldstein says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFrdlm"&gt;Goldstein says that after he and Huffman saw Hipmunk was shutting down, they wanted to create a flight search tool “with less headache, with less dependence on backroom dealing.” He says that they call it the “no collusion philosophy” and that his company does not have any relationships with airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzQTFc"&gt;It’s not exactly surprising that there aren’t deals with airlines, because what seems to be happening behind the scenes is that the browser extension is essentially scraping the search results on each individual airline’s website. Because it’s a browser extension, to the websites it looks like a normal user doing a normal search, when in fact it’s the Chrome extension clicking the buttons and filling in the fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gw140PkWZou7Sx6zJMvZd57lQtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422298/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_12.22.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ1Bbi"&gt;Putting an entire flight search service inside a Chrome extension is clever, but it does require a level of trust in the company. Depending on how it’s written, a Chrome extension can gather a significant amount of information about your browsing habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SePmX"&gt;Goldstein says his company will not collect or share any use data beyond what’s necessary to get payment information for the subscription (and some basic analytics). You can see its &lt;a href="https://subscribe.flightpenguin.com/privacy"&gt;privacy policy here&lt;/a&gt;. Since it’s a subscription service, he also says that Flight Penguin takes no commissions and will show no ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jdZkL"&gt;We’ll need to kick the tires on the service ourselves before we can say if it’s any good. One big question looming over the entire enterprise is whether the airline industry will do anything (either technically or legally) to try to block the Flight Penguin extension from gathering search results from their sites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest budget phones ask: is refresh rate more important than resolution?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuFrMXoqVwLqUN3dC0KTspxBkuU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69080845/galaxy_f12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="du4xVp"&gt;If you had to choose: would you choose a sharper screen on your smartphone, or a smoother-scrolling one? This year, budget phone buyers may be asking themselves that question: the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/oneplus-brings-a-90hz-smartphone-to-the-us-for-180/"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;Moto G50,&lt;/a&gt; and the new Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-fullonfab-galaxy-f12-with-true-48mp-quad-camera-and-90hz-display"&gt;Galaxy F12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-india-launches-monsterreloaded-galaxy-m12-with-8nm-exynos-processor-and-90hz-display"&gt;M12&lt;/a&gt; all refresh their screens 90 times per second (which is good!) but with a lower-than-optimal screen resolution of 720p. That’s the same resolution as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review"&gt;Galaxy Nexus from 2011&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Liz9"&gt;Compared to your average iPhone, that’s a paltry number of pixels. Since the iPhone 4 debuted in 2010, every Apple handset has offered at least 326 pixels per inch (PPI), enough so you can’t make out those individual pixels with the naked eye at typical viewing distances. (The marketing term is “retina display.”) Here, the PPI would be more like 270. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i9AjxE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yj1go6OuZ4A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rxfEv"&gt;And yet Apple has never offered an iPhone with a high-refresh-rate screen, which we’ve often found to be one of the most desirable features on high-end and mid-range smartphones since it makes everything you do (not just games) feel much smoother. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;Apple might make it happen later this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk7ygU"&gt;But the Galaxy F12 and M12, the OnePlus and Moto all show that high-refresh doesn’t need to be a high-end feature at all, or even a $300 one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;like we recently saw with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The Samsung phones in particular cost under $150 each, as long as you’re willing to sacrifice pixels to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jlaiw"&gt;In other ways, the 9,999-rupee handsets seem like they might be decent picks too: they’re based on the same basic platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;as the Galaxy A12 and its four-camera array&lt;/a&gt;, but with a larger 6,000mAh battery that dwarfs many others on the market. You get a sidemounted fingerprint sensor. Just note while its 8nm Exynos 850 processor might sound shiny and new, it’s not comparable with Qualcomm’s recent 800-series Snapdragon chips. It’s closer to 2019’s Snapdragon 665 in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xibs7b"&gt;It’s not clear whether either of these phones will come to the US quite yet. The OnePlus Nord N100 already has, and the G50 launched in Europe late last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAN6mD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse’s new direct payments let you toss a coin to creators, and they get 100 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Surveillance Fears After Clubhouse App Takes Saudi By Storm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0GaFF7avwGqg9zlq5Ic6E4QXIM=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69080758/1231631217.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YslMkG"&gt;Social audio app Clubhouse will let all users pay other creators starting Monday. It’s the first monetization tool built right into the app. Clubhouse says it won’t take a cut of payments, meaning that creators get the entirety of what somebody sends them. Not everyone will be able to &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt; payments just yet, though; that will be rolling out in waves, “starting with a small test group,” &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/introducing-payments"&gt;Clubhouse says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXgsc8"&gt;To pay a Clubhouse creator who can receive payments, tap on their profile, then tap on the “Send Money” button, and then choose how much you send them. You’ll also have to pay a  “small card processing fee” that goes to Stripe, which is Clubhouse’s payments processing partner. The first time to try to pay someone, Clubhouse will ask you to add a credit or debit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DrY5y1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10430926"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wrl4Wb"&gt;The news of direct payments comes a few weeks after Clubhouse announced its first creator accelerator program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330281/clubhouse-accelerator-creators-davison-app"&gt;Clubhouse Creator First&lt;/a&gt;, which will take on 20 aspiring hosts and creators to help them build their audiences and monetize their shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP83j8"&gt;The accelerator and the new direct payments could give creators more incentive to stay on Clubhouse instead of jumping to one of the many other social media platforms that have copied &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;Clubhouse’s social audio format&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Clubhouse is only available on iOS as an invite-only app, though an &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/"&gt;Android version is in the works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d6kabX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Clubhouse defined a format — now it has to defend it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nQlw5k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Once again, someone tampered with an entire drinking water supply via the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTb389vr_q7sBL5g9c3njARfEO4=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69079493/2012-10-09_10-32-34-1024.1349976126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLoBc6"&gt;You would think that something as critical as a town or county’s drinking water supply would be well-protected  — you know, like how America’s nuclear armament was isolated from the internet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931800/usa-nuclear-8-inch-floppy-disk-solid-state-transition"&gt;even relied on eight-inch floppy disks until just recently&lt;/a&gt;? And yet we’ve now had &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; instances where someone was able to remotely log into a municipal water supply in a way that could have harmed people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofuTfj"&gt;Remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273170/hackers-water-treatment-facility-florida-hacked-chemical-levels-changed"&gt;the story of the Florida water treatment facility&lt;/a&gt; where someone was able to change the chemical levels? Something similar happened in March 2019 in Kansas’ Ellsworth County, too, where 22-year-old Wyatt Travnichek now stands accused of shutting down the region’s water cleaning system “with the intention of harming” it, according to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ks/pr/indictment-kansas-man-indicted-tampering-public-water-system"&gt;a statement from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DHRtxy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maybe remote access shouldn’t be a feature of our nation’s drinking water supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9SvyY0"&gt;The wildest part is that in both cases, these municipalities left themselves wide open to tampering — they installed the remote access software themselves so employees could log in to monitor the systems! That’s what Travnichek was hired to do in Kansas, and authorities aren’t even accusing him of “hacking” the system &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20536881-travnichek-indictment"&gt;in their indictment&lt;/a&gt;. He simply “logged in remotely” months after he left the job, began shutting things down, and is now facing up to 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgJDk0"&gt;That sounds remarkably similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277300/florida-water-treatment-chemical-tamper-teamviewer-shared-password"&gt;what happened in Florida&lt;/a&gt;, where the water treatment plant never bothered to change the password or even remove an old piece of remote control software after they’d installed a newer one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzGhcn"&gt;Maybe we should stop doing that. President Joe Biden is currently trying to push &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;a $2 trillion infrastructure plan&lt;/a&gt;, including billions to deliver safe water and replace lead pipes, among &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362079/joe-biden-infrastructure-plan-abandoned-oil-gas-wells-mines"&gt;other hazards&lt;/a&gt;. To keep the water safe, we also need to keep the water secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzKHJf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/kansas-ellsworth-water-district-hack-travnichek/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberscoop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;spoke to a customer service rep at the Kansas water utility, who claimed the incident didn’t harm residents’ drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
