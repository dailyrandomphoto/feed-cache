    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7bYHJu"&gt;The sweeping federal antitrust case against Google has given rise to a significant fight over data held by Microsoft, and the company is now facing a subpoena for millions of documents that could shed light on its attempts to compete with Google’s search engine. Having initially cooperated with prosecutors in building an antitrust case against Google, Microsoft could be obligated to produce millions more documents at the request of Google’s defense team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwFB3H"&gt;At a status hearing on Friday morning, Judge Amit Mehta heard arguments from both Google and Microsoft on the issue, but ultimately found more information was required before the court could give guidance as to how much internal data Microsoft would be required to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OtQ38e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M62YXy"&gt;“These are hard issues for any judge to resolve in a way that’s objective and meaningful,” Mehta told attorneys, “and that’s particularly so given that, with respect to the additional custodians, I don’t have any sense of the volume that would produce … or what that volume would mean for the timing of production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZTnd6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws"&gt;Filed in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google focuses on anti-competitive behavior in search and search advertising, alleging among other claims that the company’s exclusivity agreements on Android and iOS shut out competing search engines. Separate antitrust cases against Google have also been filed focusing on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333848/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-complaint-chrome-privacy"&gt;browser privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;alleged manipulation of search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J1V9J"&gt;In advance of the Department of Justice filing charges, Microsoft provided more than 400,000 documents to civil investigative demands from prosecutors. In a filing before today’s hearing, Google &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21020163-google-microsoft-subpoena-compliance"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that participation entitles the company to a similar range of documents that might be helpful to its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zdCpz4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case,” says Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3Ii7K"&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft. The DOJ and Colorado Complaints refer to it or its products dozens of times,” Google’s filing reads. “Having so obviously pressed for and cooperated in the preparation of the present Complaints to be filed against Google, Microsoft cannot credibly avoid significant discovery in these cases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ki2vR7"&gt;Google first issued a subpoena to Microsoft in April, seeking “older documents that will shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully on the merits.” But Microsoft agreed to only eight of the 27 executives to be searched, and drastically limited the search strings to which they would be subject. Google is now asking for a more powerful court order to compel the production of documents from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQP43v"&gt;In an appendix to its filing, Google listed 19 current and former Microsoft executives who may hold communications relevant to the case, including former Windows Phone chief Andrew Lees and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/12/4515830/terry-myerson-microsoft-windows-reorganization"&gt;former Windows head Terry Myerson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmcIXV"&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case: the development and distribution of Microsoft’s various search engines, Microsoft’s search advertising business, and Microsoft’s effort to market devices that would give it yet more search access points beyond the ever-present Windows desktop,” the filing reads. “Google simply seeks discovery commensurate with Plaintiffs’ allegations, which reach back two decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Drctt9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/169/united-states-of-america-v-google-llc/"&gt;In its own filing&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pushed back against this logic, arguing Google is filing unnecessarily broad requests in an effort to additionally delay the case. “In the past nine days, in fact, Google has proposed seventeen&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;additional custodians,” Microsoft’s filing claims, “including nine on July 19, five on July 26, and three today, July 27. Google has not explained why it believes searching these additional twenty-eight custodians ... is necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVYq9s"&gt;Weighing the two arguments, the court seemed to slightly favor Google’s side of the case, but ultimately asked for more data on the burden required to produce the documents. “The description of the people [Google has] identified as additional custodians certainly struck me as not reaching,” Judge Mehta said, “and I haven’t heard Microsoft say today that there’s minimal chance that they’re likely to have records at all that are responsive and relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT7QOM"&gt;However, the court ultimately found there was insufficient information about the burden posed by production, and the dispute is likely to continue at least until August 20th, the deadline set for further filings on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kh5UE"&gt;“The best I can do for you today is to give you a deadline by which to get back to me with concrete information,” Judge Mehta told the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRUtgj"&gt;The finding is one more turn in what is likely to be a long and contentious discovery period for the antitrust case. Microsoft says it believes the first phase of its own document production will last until at least October of this year. Trial proceedings for &lt;em&gt;US v. Google&lt;/em&gt; are scheduled to begin on September 12th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCBFsH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watchdog denies Blue Origin’s challenge to NASA’s lunar lander program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Founder Jeff Bezos Makes Announcement At Satellite 2019 Conference In DC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkETxgEPwxS6SXCGoljeDWEei6w=/0x25:1270x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656764/1148070239.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bbrulx"&gt;Blue Origin’s protest against NASA’s decision to pick just one company to build its first human lunar lander in decades was denied by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the watchdog agency said Friday, also denying a similar protest from Dynetics. The decision keeps Blue Origin’s rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the sole winner of NASA’s lucrative Moon lander program and hands a loss to Jeff Bezos, whose space company waged a months-long fight to win the same funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIsuxy"&gt;In a formal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; filed in April, Bezos’ Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics had accused NASA of running afoul of contracting law when the agency shelved their proposals and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;gave Elon Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; a lone $3 billion contract to land a crew of humans on the Moon by 2024. NASA had said it could award up to two companies for the contract, but never committed to that number, and went with SpaceX’s Starship proposal. The GAO found that NASA “reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mCex1"&gt;In picking only SpaceX, NASA said it did what it could with the short funding it had from Congress, which gave NASA a quarter of the roughly $3 billion it requested for its astronaut Moon lander program. In its protest, Blue Origin said NASA should’ve called off the program or retooled it when the agency realized it wouldn’t have had enough money to fund two contractors. But the GAO rejected that argument, saying “there was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement as a result of the amount of funding available for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcuEyk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The special effects behind Loki’s doomed planet of Lamentis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MrvmiO2Djk8NzyAFyADQTu1eaA=/714x0:3126x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656723/LMT2640_103_comp_v031_20210609_r709.1068_R_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How the team at Digital Domain destroyed a world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="p3n7Ok"&gt;When special effects studio Digital Domain was approached by Marvel to work on an episode of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeLokiSpecialEffects073021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; there was one sequence in particular that was exciting: the chance to destroy an entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6onOR"&gt;The third episode of the series is set on the moon of a planet called Lamentis, which is about to collapse on itself, taking the moon with it. As Loki and Sylvie wander the desolate, purple landscape, meteors pound the ground around them. This all leads up to a crescendo when they reach a small town, which is battered by debris as the planet rips apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAmVl1"&gt;Even before he had any idea about the rest of the show, or how the story would play out, VFX supervisor Jean-Luc Dinsdale knew that this would be an important moment for &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. “It was pretty clear from the start that this was a huge sequence and a big milestone for the series,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Technically, it’s a really challenging sequence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHD7Lg"&gt;Prior to that point, most of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; was set inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;the retrofuturistic hallways of the Time Variance Authority&lt;/a&gt;, which made the shift to Lamentis all the more jarring. When Loki and Sylvie first step outside on the moon, viewers are greeted to a grim, dirty landscape that looks like nothing else on the show — though that wasn’t always the plan. According to Dinsdale, the teams at Marvel Studios and Digital Domain played around with a few ideas for the planet and its moon, including a lush world covered in greenery, and another dominated by massive oceans. At one point they considered having a planet with a molten core that would create quite the spectacle when it finally imploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5khVfu"&gt;“We explored that for a bit, but after a while the decision was made to make it more of a dead planet, a planet that had been mined to a crazy extent and basically had died through all of the exploitation,” Dinsdale explains. “So we ended up literally with this dead husk of a planet, that, as you can see in the final footage, has mining holes all over it and has really been ravaged to the point that there’s nothing left to it. Which I think explains why it imploded; the core of the planet got mined, and there’s no structural integrity so it falls apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lieCZ-1Ps-uz3TTAI6m0WTcVDy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750937/LCL1000_103_TRL_comp_v042_r709_UHD.1012_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gINiwQ94OhJmuzyMrCQ06eOGvyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750966/ARC_103_10587_R_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBavPAql711-YAAOcP_O77xJdqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750961/ARC_103_09262_R2_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPn8R0"&gt;That decision ties into the way Dinsdale likes to approach VFX, which is to base them in reality. Sure, none of us have ever seen a planet explode and take a populated moon with it, but the idea is that, with a grounding in real physics, this outlandish visual can be more believable. In addition to looking at lots of reference material, the team used software called Houdini to simulate how the explosion would happen, right down to the amount of dust and debris that would appear. “In my experience, the best way to approach visual effects is to base it on reality,” says Dinsdale. “What is the reason for this planet to be exploding? We always walk this fine line of what makes sense and what looks really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="yIVkyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10677788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NucFsJ"&gt;This also ties into some of the world-building going on in the episode. The purple-hued moon of Lamentis is not a very welcoming place, and viewers learn this largely through the visuals. The miners left on the planet wear shabby clothes, and the few buildings look weathered and beaten. The team at Digital Domain was able to expand on this not just through the landscape, which is largely barren, but also the equipment seen in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IvcdI"&gt;“The production [team] really wanted to give the sense that they had been mining for a while,” says Dinsdale. “The mining equipment on this planet is dilapidated, it’s been used for a very long time, and it’s not like it’s super high-tech. To me it was similar to James Cameron’s &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;, the design aesthetic where there’s nothing fancy about this planet, therefore it’s dirty and used and dusty.” Much of this involved the labor-intensive process of adding lots of extra detail to everything, whether it’s dents in a spaceship or layers of dirt on some mining equipment. “You don’t necessarily see all of those individual details, but just this buildup of detail creates the sense that this thing looks real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7jM6"&gt;The effects studio worked on the show for about a year and a half, and eventually contributed more than 300 VFX shots. One of the challenges was that, despite lasting just 43 minutes, the episode cycles through many different and varied tones. At the beginning it’s like a chase sequence, as Loki and Sylvie run to escape the meteors raining down on the surface. Later, things are much more subdued as the pair have quiet, heartfelt conversations while the world is crumbling around them. This all culminates in that big final sequence when the town is destroyed. And all of these moments required something different in terms of special effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Pz5NgX1mB5lPOTjgPvj1sNTOys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750972/LTR4000_103_comp_v106.1027_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSkBvvcdW3oUF_5HZ2oI_hFzdjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750973/LSU2900_103_comp_v097.1099_C_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8117T4wMzSGDvK0e20RQ7kp_tSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750983/LTR7020_103_comp_v073.1103_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IT52Or"&gt;“We need the meteors to be scary, we need them to have a lot of velocity and huge impacts, debris flying everywhere, to create that sense of jeopardy,” Dinsdale says of that early chase sequence. “But later on in the show, as they’re walking towards the mining town, the filmmakers wanted the threat of the meteors to still be there, that’s why you’re always seeing them in the background. But a different look was created to give the sense that, yes the meteors are always there, there’s always a bit of jeopardy, but it’s not the big Michael Bay moment where they’re about to be crushed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZlJV8"&gt;These sections also proved to be challenging from the VFX side because of how they were filmed. During the action sequences, real debris was thrown around on set in order to give the actors something to respond to. It made for more true-to-life acting, but as Dinsdale explains, “that makes work for us a lot harder, because we have to go in and remove the stuff that was dropped on set, replace the backgrounds, and then layer back in debris to bring that sense of danger back. Even though it’s more work for us on the backend, the results are much more satisfactory. You end up with a pretty amazing look.” He adds that “the amount of cleaning up that had to be done to the footage was extensive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wMad0B"&gt;The amount of work involved was similar to that of a feature-length film, and the result is arguably the most visually striking of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s six episodes. From its harsh color scheme to its desolate vibe, Lamentis really doesn’t look like anything else in the series — which is what makes it so memorable. “We basically got to create our own little world separate from the rest of the show,” says Dinsdale.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Normally $50 a pop, BuyDig is offering a trio of Google Nest Minis for nearly 60 percent off. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mrCmsy"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, the Google Nest Mini is a miniature take on the larger smart speakers that came before it. The compact device doesn’t boast the same sound quality as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, but it's impressive for its size, especially when mounted to a wall or placed in a smaller room. What’s more, it packs backlit volume buttons and many of the same features that have come to define the category, including the ability to answer voice queries, control your smart home, and play music, adding to its overall versatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvIwq9"&gt;If you’re already tapped into the Google ecosystem or are looking for an inexpensive way to strew audio throughout your home, BuyDig is currently offering a three-pack of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F334087468632%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals073021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22600005%2Fgoogle-nest-mini-smart-speaker-apple-magsafe-charger-macbook-air-m1-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Minis on eBay for $64&lt;/a&gt;, significantly less than if you were to pay per Mini. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lJFfNl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; has officially arrived, however, if you’re looking for a cheaper means for charging your iPhone 12, 12 Pro, or an older device that supports Qi charging, there’s always Apple’s MagSafe Charger. The simple, wired accessory attaches magnetically to the latest iPhone 12 models and allows for 15-watt charging speeds when paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt; (sold separately). And while far slower than a traditional USB-C cable — it takes about an hour to charge an iPhone 12 to 40 percent — it’s also more convenient, especially given that it can charge AirPods models with a wireless charging case and older Qi-compatible accessories. Normally $40, Apple’s MagSafe Charger is currently &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?sid=VergeDeals072921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-magsafe-charger-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Woot for $30&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best-ever price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla agrees to pay $1.5 million to settle battery throttling lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uqgT5nkQefNjFAYNf66IKXsQoYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656244/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GieOUA"&gt;Tesla agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the company used a software update to reduce the maximum battery voltage for some of its Model S sedans, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-agrees-pay-15-mln-settle-claims-over-temporary-battery-voltage-reduction-2021-07-29/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNihWo"&gt;The software update, which was released in 2019, resulted in slower charging speed and diminished range for around 1,743 vehicles, the plaintiffs alleged. As a result of the settlement, Tesla agreed to pay $625 to each of the affected vehicle owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5YGEYM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla agreed to pay $625 to each of the affected vehicle owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bRHx1G"&gt;“This amount is many times the prorated value of the temporarily reduced maximum voltage, and thus represents an excellent and efficient result for the Settlement Class,” the court document reads. “In return, the Settlement Class will release claims related to the software updates that imposed and then restored the batteries’ maximum voltage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze74f3"&gt;Lawyers for the owners said they conducted an investigation that found that “voltage limitation was temporary, with a 10% reduction lasting about 3 months, and a smaller 7% reduction lasting another 7 months before the corrective update was released in March 2020. Following that second update, the vehicles’ voltage showed steady restoration over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdNCLq"&gt;It’s not immediately clear how the plaintiffs will receive their payment from Tesla. A US district court judge will convene a hearing on the proposed settlement on December 9th. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment; Tesla dissolved its PR department in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7wFs4"&gt;This isn’t the first time Tesla has been forced to pay its customers for throttling their vehicle batteries. Last May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451101/tesla-fine-norway-throttle-battery-charging-speed"&gt;the company was ordered to pay&lt;/a&gt; 136,000 kroner ($16,000) each to thousands of customers in Norway for slowing down charging speeds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The bad science behind trans healthcare bans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A pile of papers with their text blacked out with a marker.

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers cling to flawed evidence while restricting care for trans youth&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="co53IH"&gt;Conservative legislators and special interest groups are using scientific studies as a cudgel in their attempts to limit children’s access to gender affirming healthcare. One of the biggest battles is taking place in Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0rhd0"&gt;“We can’t act like these studies don’t matter,” Arkansas state Senator Alan Clark said on March 29th, arguing in support of &lt;a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1570&amp;amp;ddBienniumSession=2021%2F2021R"&gt;HB 1570&lt;/a&gt;, a ban on gender affirming healthcare for minors in Arkansas. Clark was referring to cherry-picked research that depicted various treatments as dangerous, experimental, and unsafe for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgqgvF"&gt;After a vote, Arkansas became the first state to pass such a bill into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl8cHD"&gt;The ACLU &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/were-suing-arkansas-over-its-ban-on-health-care-for-trans-youth/"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Arkansas in May challenging the constitutionality of the law. A judge &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/judge-blocks-arkansas-ban-gender-affirming-care-transgender-minors-rcna1477"&gt;temporarily blocked&lt;/a&gt; the ban on July 21st, days before it was set to go into effect. “We were able to show that these laws are irrational,” said ACLU attorney Chase Strangio at a press conference, “we’re going to keep arguing that up through the court system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIDOSh"&gt;Arkansas is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country"&gt;one of 20 states&lt;/a&gt; to attempt bans on gender affirming medical care for young people in the last year. All of the bills try to weaponize science — in the form of questionable, outdated, or misinterpreted research — against trans children and their parents while willfully ignoring both the experiences of trans people and the expert opinion of many groups of scientists, scholars, and doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjMdmx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;They’re saying they’re doing science, but they’re ignoring what all the scientific associations are saying,” says Florence Ashley, a transfeminine jurist and bioethicist who studies the ways science and legal systems affect trans youth. The &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/advocacy-update/march-26-2021-state-advocacy-update"&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/news-releases/frontline-physicians-oppose-legislation-that-interferes-in-or-criminalizes-patient-care"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/03/09/transgender-legislation-030921"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Latest_News/AACAP_Statement_Responding_to_Efforts-to_ban_Evidence-Based_Care_for_Transgender_and_Gender_Diverse.aspx"&gt;American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2019/transgender-custody-statement"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/Public%20Policies/2020/FINAL%20Joint%20Statement%20Opposing%20Anti%20Trans%20Legislation%20Jan%2028%202020.pdf?_t=1580243903"&gt;World Professional Association for Transgender Health&lt;/a&gt; (WPATH), and others have consistently opposed the bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0PRwy"&gt;HB 1570 shares nearly identical language with proposed trans healthcare bans that are making their way through legislature in other states. That’s because they’re &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/03/anti-lgbtq-orgs-drafting-anti-trans-bills-policymakers/"&gt;copy-paste bills based on “model legislature”&lt;/a&gt; from a coalition backed by anti-LGBTQ hate groups. Here’s a breakdown of why the arguments presented in these bills don’t hold up to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Su9wwl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="B1at2J"&gt;The idea that many trans kids will grow out of it is referred to in research as desistance. The term comes from criminology, where it describes the process of ceasing criminal behavior. The concept of desistance is often used to remove children’s agency in discussions of their own identities, painting them as confused or going through a phase. It’s also used to advocate for “reparative” conversion therapies, which, unlike gender affirming care, are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-conversion-therapy-associated-severe-psychological-distress-n1052416"&gt;unethical and dangerous&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0k6hTd"&gt;The most frequently cited desistance statistic is that around 80 percent of kids who experience gender dysphoria will go on to be cisgender adults. This percentage is usually attributed to four studies, published from 2008 to 2013, which looked at young children at gender identity clinics in Canada and the Netherlands. There are a number of problems with how those studies were carried out and how their findings were interpreted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9uTOW"&gt;All of the studies included children who had not actually expressed gender dysphoria and had instead been deemed gender-nonconforming by their parents. Labeling those children as desistant drastically inflates the percentage. In three of the studies, participants who didn’t follow up with the researchers in adolescence or adulthood were assumed to be desistant, again inaccurately raising the desistance percentage. The methodological issues are further discussed in an article &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5951646/"&gt;by researchers&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/detransition-desistance-and-disinformation-a-guide-for-understanding-transgender-children-993b7342946e"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://juliaserano.medium.com/reframing-transgender-desistance-debates-68648a4fd01a"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; by trans writer and biologist Julia Serano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0Et2F"&gt;The desistance myth is also beside the point because it refers to children younger than those who would be eligible for the physiological interventions listed in the bills. “It’s just not relevant,” says Ashley. “This is a prepubertal population. It’s not the group that’s being offered puberty blockers. Those being offered puberty blockers are the ones that have already not desisted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qRvIqE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EDK1Ih"&gt;This line is likely referencing &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885"&gt;a 2011 study conducted in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, which sponsors of the bill have mentioned specifically in their arguments. That study did find that adult trans participants had higher rates of mental illness, suicide attempts, and death by suicide than cisgender people of the same age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmpwEV"&gt;What the senators failed to mention is that the researchers &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; acknowledged that gender affirming surgeries alleviate gender dysphoria, and that their findings should inspire better care for trans people after surgery. The researchers state explicitly that their results should not be interpreted to say that gender affirming surgeries increase mortality. The study is also limited in several ways; most notably, its focus was trans people who were treated in the 1970s and ‘80s, and significant improvements in treatment, from mental health care to surgical techniques, have been made since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l27dh4"&gt;Avery Everhart, a trans medical and legal geographer who studies trans healthcare access, points out another issue with these kinds of studies — it’s difficult to directly compare the mental health of cis and trans kids because there are so many variables to take into account. “It’s not ideal to compare to cisgender, mentally healthy, well-adjusted, youth of the same age, instead you should be comparing to other youth who also experience comorbid issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qW54OV"&gt;Trans youth aren’t more predisposed to mental illness and other problems simply by nature of being trans, Everhart says. Living in a transphobic society, where children may not have family support and lawmakers are trying to restrict their rights, is bound to have negative effects on mental health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgNG3W"&gt;“In biomedical research, in general, there’s an assumption that it is better to pathologize the individual,” says Everhart, “as opposed to diagnosing the society that gave them suicidality, that caused them to be depressed, that may have led them to have substance abuse issues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wtCIDZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CXPV6y"&gt;“Puberty blockers have been around a long time, and weren’t invented for trans children,” says Jules Gill-Peterson, trans historian and author of &lt;em&gt;Histories of the Transgender Child&lt;/em&gt;. There’s plenty of evidence that they do what they’re supposed to do: delay puberty. They’ve been prescribed for decades &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnzjk/no-one-had-a-problem-with-puberty-blockers-when-only-cis-kids-took-them"&gt;for cis children&lt;/a&gt; who enter puberty at particularly young ages, and are approved by the FDA for that use. The blockers used for trans and cis children are the same, are only used temporarily, and their effects are reversible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0luOK"&gt;A lack of long-term studies doesn’t equate to a lack of knowledge about puberty blockers’ risks or benefits for trans children. The use of puberty blockers for trans children is in line with the WPATH &lt;a href="https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc"&gt;Standards of Care&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/11/3869/4157558?login=true#99603316"&gt;Endocrine Society’s guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(17)30099-2/fulltext"&gt;2017 review&lt;/a&gt; of available evidence determined that puberty suppression is reasonably safe and is associated with improved psychological health. Preliminary results from a &lt;a href="https://ijpeonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13633-020-00078-2"&gt;longitudinal study in the US&lt;/a&gt; suggest lowered depression and suicidal ideation in trans youth on hormone treatments, including puberty blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ECRCgD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt; “Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4q5xSe"&gt;The lack of randomized clinical trials isn’t really a smoking gun here. It would be unethical to run studies where hormones were given to some people and withheld from others. Like puberty blockers, hormone therapies are prescribed to cisgender people for a variety of reasons. For example, anti-estrogen drugs are recommended for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166145/"&gt;teen cisgender boys with persistent gynecomastia&lt;/a&gt; (breast enlargement) who experience psychological distress, though they’re not approved by the FDA for that use. There are no randomized clinical trials for such treatments for cis children. Lawmakers seemingly have no objections to hormone therapies unless they’re used for trans children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIyhrd"&gt;Minors are prescribed hormones after careful consideration and discussion between healthcare providers, children, and their caregivers. There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X16000963"&gt;barriers and gatekeeping&lt;/a&gt; to gender affirming care, and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11673-020-10086-9#Abs1"&gt;researchers argue&lt;/a&gt; that young teens are often capable of making their own decisions about when to start hormones. WPATH, the Endocrine Society, and other medical associations consider hormone therapy safe and beneficial for trans youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="u8pQtw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“It is of grave concern to the General Assembly that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing the benefits of such interventions outweigh the risks.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tfoe26"&gt;Very few minors undergo gender affirming surgeries of any kind, especially genital surgeries. Those who do are usually at least 16 years old and have already been socially and medically transitioning for some time with the guidance of healthcare providers. The WPATH Standards of Care recommend waiting until the age of majority, and having been on hormones for at least a year. It’s also worth noting that the use of puberty blockers can prevent trans children from needing many surgeries later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyDPOT"&gt;The vast majority of trans youth do not get any surgeries until they’re over 18, but there is growing evidence that there are benefits to having certain procedures done at a younger age. &lt;a href="https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(17)30108-X/fulltext"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; noted that transfeminine patients were more likely to keep up with vaginoplasty aftercare while at home with family members, as opposed to recovering while away at college. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2674039?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=JAMA_Pediatrics_TrendMD_1"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; of transmasculine people who had chest surgery earlier in life found very low rates of regret, as well as significantly lower dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcNFXC"&gt;People who oppose trans healthcare rely on fear-mongering language around gender affirming surgeries, using words like “irreversible” and “sterilizing” and making comparisons to mutilation. But bodies go through irreversible changes all the time, from puberty and aging to appendectomies and tonsillectomies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxRSEW"&gt;“It’s a fantasy that the cis body is some sort of organic, naturally developing body that just perfectly unfolds according to nature’s plan, and never undergoes any sorts of significant changes,” says Gill-Peterson. “The human body is fundamentally biologically plastic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kab9Ue"&gt;“Irreversibility makes a couple of assumptions when we see it talked about this way, that it’s a zero sum that something either is or is not reversible, as opposed to on a spectrum,” says Everhart, “some things will return to their previous state, but maybe not fully, others will totally reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yfPGQU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HB 1570&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Gender transition procedures” do not include: (i) Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development including a person with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous [...] (ii) Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development that the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing [...]”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dKuYhL"&gt;The bill bans surgeries for trans youth, but specifies that the ban doesn’t apply to procedures on intersex people. This exception leaves room for healthcare providers to continue the traumatizing practice of operating on intersex children of all ages without their consent or knowledge. “They’re going to force intersex people to endure the things that they’re withholding from trans people,” says Gill-Peterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAif7U"&gt;Unlike medical treatments that trans youth seek out to affirm their identities, procedures done on intersex children, often during infancy, do cause irreversible physical and psychological harm. Medical opinion has &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/09/17/us-medical-association-stands-against-unnecessary-intersex-surgeries"&gt;shifted away&lt;/a&gt; from promoting intersex surgeries as medically necessary, and intersex activists are still &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolang/lurie-childrens-hospital-intersex-surgery"&gt;calling on hospitals&lt;/a&gt; across the country to stop performing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pfDkzh"&gt;“That’s the tell. That’s how you know none of these bills have anything to do with science and are purely ideological,” says Gill-Peterson. “[It’s] all the same medicine for cis, trans, and intersex people. They’re just treated entirely differently now under the law, and I think that’s really, really disturbing.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use transitions to make your TikTok videos more interesting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntvV3iB9aOvgQt8w_Z3xKqT-hJ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656197/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4bJQV"&gt;If you’re a TikTok creator, then you know how quickly those minutes of video can fly by. One of the ways you can move storytelling along is by using transitions between clips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUBOh7"&gt;While TikTok offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573640/tiktok-video-template-how-to-beginner"&gt;a handful of templates&lt;/a&gt; that resemble slideshow presentation transitions, these don’t seem to be very popular. Instead, many users opt for manual transitions that use video editing and recording tricks to make their video flow from one clip to the next. Some of these transitions are relatively simple and only require a couple of steps, while others need a little bit of planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8cecE"&gt;All the transitions serve a purpose, though, and that is to move the video along and keep pace with either the music or what the person is saying. Transitions can also be used to reveal something new, like an appearance change, or to signal the speaker is moving onto the next topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dJD4d"&gt;Here’s how to do a simple TikTok transition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="92Wr7J"&gt;Use one hand to hold your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qGZSmU"&gt;Turn your camera so it’s on selfie mode. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AGkRXz"&gt;Press and hold the record button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APPS2s"&gt;Say or do whatever you would like to say or do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x0k4H5"&gt;Once you’re finished talking, use your free hand to cover the phone’s camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4nO9Fc"&gt;Stop recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g2zw4p"&gt;Set up your next shot by moving elsewhere or getting ready to start speaking again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TRpDNp"&gt;With your hand still on the camera, start recording again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="75vIxH"&gt;As you start speaking, move your hand away from the camera. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Frj3U"&gt;Finish the clip and stop recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Nf4EgN"&gt;Play the clip back on the next screen to make sure the transition looks smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i9Gtof"&gt;Either continue recording or publish the video! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lbKYyn"&gt;If you need an example, I use this transition method below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oAnOXG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/6989714772916833542" data-video-id="6989714772916833542" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@verge" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge"&gt;@verge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;How to turn yourself into a cartoon for your next Zoom call &lt;a title="techtok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/techtok"&gt;#techtok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="technologyhacks" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/technologyhacks"&gt;#technologyhacks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="zoomuniversity" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/zoomuniversity"&gt;#zoomuniversity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="howtomake" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/howtomake"&gt;#howtomake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - The Verge" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6989714661298014982"&gt;♬ original sound - The Verge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eNzWpd"&gt;Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can begin experimenting. Making transitions convincing really comes down to placement of the camera and timing. Some combinations require your phone, body, or both to stay in the same place for each frame. Other transitions, especially with objects or body movements, need the right timing when you’re editing the clips. Matching up the previous movement to the next movement is what makes a transition feel seamless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcSQ33"&gt;Here is an example of a more intricate transition and a visual explanation of how the creator did it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gngGTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@nickviddzz/video/6982950961073474821" data-video-id="6982950961073474821" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@nickviddzz" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nickviddzz"&gt;@nickviddzz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;RESULTS AT END &lt;a title="transition" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/transition"&gt;#transition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="transitiontutorial" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/transitiontutorial"&gt;#transitiontutorial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Master - ߹߰robert⑉❦" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Master-6968110527289494277"&gt;♬ Master - ߹߰robert⑉❦&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="jv3tj7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R89sgq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russia blames software glitch for misfired engines that shoved ISS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eq2GEayCaShfdZpF6_ryNNUth-8=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656143/5689982352.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roscosmos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5eE4im"&gt;Russia’s space agency blamed a “short-term software failure” for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600306/uncontrolled-firing-from-russian-module-causes-brief-tug-of-war-on-international-space-station"&gt;yesterday’s engine mishap&lt;/a&gt; with its new science module. The module’s thrusters unexpectedly fired hours after docking, shifting the International Space Station off its normal position. The software glitch caused the Nauka module to think it was supposed to back away from the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pAn0x"&gt;The space station, a football field-sized research laboratory floating 270 miles up in low-Earth orbit, was shoved 45 degrees off track once Nauka’s thrusters started firing. NASA said it lost control of the station’s positioning minutes later, but it was eventually repositioned back to normal after thrusters from another Russian module counteracted Nauka’s errant firings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM39dn"&gt;“Due to a short-term software failure, a direct command was mistakenly implemented to turn on the module’s engines for withdrawal, which led to some modification of the orientation of the complex as a whole,” Vladimir Solovyov, the flight director of the space station’s Russian segment &lt;a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/22251/"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OFLxF"&gt;Roscosmos will lead the investigation into the erroneous thruster firings and keep its US partners posted on any fixes, NASA’s space station manager Joel Montalbano told reporters on Thursday. The mishap forced a delay to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing’s planned launch of its uncrewed Starliner capsule&lt;/a&gt; to the ISS, which was slated for Friday at 2:53PM ET and is now planned for Tuesday, August 3rd at 1:20PM ET, the agency said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/07/29/update-to-nasas-boeing-orbital-flight-test-2-mission/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ThoL7N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nauka is operating normally, Solovyov said&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz1oqL"&gt;The space station and its new Russian module are “operating normally” now, Solovyov said, adding that “a reliable internal power and command interface was created, as well as a power supply interface that connected the module to the station.” He said the station’s Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov are balancing the pressure in Nauka and plan to enter the module to start “purifying the atmosphere and begin normal regular work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKWNi"&gt;Nauka, which means science in Russian, is a multipurpose science module designed to hold cargo and humans. Its long-delayed development began in 1995 and has gone through several design changes that pushed its original launch date of 2007 to 2021. It finally launched July 21st. Upon reaching space, it almost immediately encountered propulsion and communications issues that delayed its insertion into orbit. The module docked successfully eight days later, on Thursday, before its thrusters glitched out and shoved the station off-track.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mark Cuban-founded audio app Fireside is asking its own users to invest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ccaAj5n5B1QvdZobYVbgd25AKWw=/225x0:1515x860/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69655806/Screen_Shot_2021_07_29_at_10.12.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fireside&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8cqlOx"&gt;The Mark Cuban-funded and co-founded audio app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations"&gt;Fireside&lt;/a&gt; has yet to publicly launch, but already it’s asking the limited creators on its platform for money. In an email sent to users late last night and viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, co-founder and CEO Falon Fatemi says she and the team are accepting investments through the month of August from anyone who’s interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmDmUG"&gt;“If you believe in our vision, this is your chance to be part of it,” she writes. “Put your money where your mouth is :) (We did.)” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FusHV9"&gt;The email says more details are to come and doesn’t disclose the deal terms, how the investments will work, what the app’s valuation is, or how much the team is hoping to raise. But the email does also make a couple other announcements about the future of the app and its vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kZ3MDy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fatemi says the live conversation app was “miscategorized” as social audio&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QC9akC"&gt;Next week, at the conference Podcast Movement, Fatemi says she and Cuban will take the stage to announce a partnership with podcast hosting service Libsyn. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, Fireside hosts live audio chats similarly to Clubhouse and allows users to record those conversations. The team had told creators it planned to allow them to distribute their files as RSS-based podcasts, and the Libsyn partnership appears to be the solution for that goal. Fatemi says users will be able to optionally distribute their shows as a podcast with “one tap.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFpvef"&gt;Additionally, she says the team has arranged a deal with audio hardware company Rode to offer users discounts on various equipment. Again, no details were provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKOwQj"&gt;A Fireside spokesperson declined to comment. We’ve also reached out to Libsyn and Rode and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H4t76"&gt;Meanwhile, the Fireside app launched on iOS last week in a closed beta. Users who download the app can sign up with their phone number and email to try to get off the waitlist. Fatemi writes in her email that the app is very much not like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Live Audio Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaRHtH"&gt;“As many of you know the early media speculation miscategorized us as social audio — as many of you have stated we are creating an entirely new category,” she writes. What exactly that new category is, I’m unclear. You can see a teaser trailer for the app below, which focuses on digital creators owning their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84HfMr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/564324070?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfX1sV"&gt;Still, despite Fireside’s ownership goals, podcasting newsletter &lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/podcast-hosts-tos?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-07-26"&gt;flagged last week&lt;/a&gt; that some of the app’s terms stood out as not creator friendly. Notably, Fireside and associated parties may use the “recordings, including your name and likeness, for any commercial and non-commercial purposes (including the creation of NFTs), including to use, reproduce, distribute, and license to others in accordance with Fireside’s Terms of Service, in any manner of media whatsoever now or hereafter known, without further compensation or permissions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4d2tV"&gt;The terms also seem to give Fireside ultimate ownership of recordings that happen in the app, and an arbitration clause is included, as well. Some of these details might be standard, but again, they stand out because of Fatemi’s stated interest in freeing creators from binding ownership agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwhpPa"&gt;It’s unclear when Fireside will publicly launch, arguably the detail everyone wants to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qpo5Uq"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600255/amazon-q2-2021-earnings-aws-andy-jassy"&gt;Amazon’s Q2 earnings are in&lt;/a&gt;, it has submitted a 10-Q filing with the SEC that includes &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/f373b2a5-224e-4ace-b470-bdb5d2e1b223.html#"&gt;additional details&lt;/a&gt; like this eye-popping note about a fine imposed by Luxembourg’s National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3EGvXK"&gt;On July 16, 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CMwS9e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The largest GDPR fine to date was a €50 million penalty handed to Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psN8At"&gt;That converts to about $887 million US, which would be the largest fine ever under Europe’s data protection law. The CNPD has not publicly committed on its decision, and Amazon didn’t specify what revised business practices the commission is proposing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4u6H8"&gt;EU commissioners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;announced in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it was their belief Amazon’s retail business misused non-public data to compete with other sellers in France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOPoaw"&gt; In a statement given to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-hit-with-record-eu-privacy-fine-11627646144"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon says, “the proposed fine is entirely out of proportion with even that interpretation.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes that GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) regulations allow for fines of up to 4 percent of a company’s revenue, with the released number amounting to about 4.2 percent of Amazon’s reported $21.3 billion income for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9X6ik"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="78oJY3"&gt;Maintaining the security of our customers’ information and their trust are top priorities. There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party. These facts are undisputed. We strongly disagree with the CNPD’s ruling, and we intend to appeal. The decision relating to how we show customers relevant advertising relies on subjective and untested interpretations of European privacy law, and the proposed fine is entirely out of proportion with even that interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9LTTFp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 9:35AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to clarify that the Luxembourg commission is imposing the fine, and to add a statement from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
