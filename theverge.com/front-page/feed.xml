    <title>This is the best Windows File Explorer design concept I’ve ever seen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-HnCHUXF1kw4jH_5hTJ9MhrxO8s=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129461/fileexplorer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;File Explorer concept.&lt;/em&gt; | Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K62khu"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows File Explorer has existed in the operating system since Windows 95, and it has served as a focal point for design concepts ever since. I’ve seen a variety of mockups over the years that try to redesign the File Explorer and modernize it, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/"&gt;Reddit user Alur2020&lt;/a&gt; has really nailed what modern file management should look like in Windows 10. This is the best Windows File Explorer concept I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdnNDA"&gt;The concept, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/mouth-watering-user-concept-of-windows-10-file-explorer-has-reddit-salivating/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is immediately striking for its sheer simplicity and usability. The default home area imagines a location where you can quickly see pinned items, drives, and recently used files. It’s a simple location to find anything important. Alur2020 has also incorporated Microsoft’s new Windows 10 system icons, and even color coded groups for files and folders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIGZkSYosBT6JmlQ7tNU2z6rcjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445533/qr815nfao5t61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;File Explorer concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J487z5"&gt;Aside from the pure design, this concept also imagines what tabs might look like in a modern File Explorer. It looks very similar to Microsoft Edge browser tabs, allowing File Explorer users to open up multiple folders in a single view. Microsoft was working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17092752/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-tabs"&gt;Sets feature for Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; that included tabs in File Explorer, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512250/microsoft-windows-10-sets-feature-app-tabs-removal"&gt;put this work on hold&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago. It’s not clear whether File Explorer will ever officially get tabs support in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMnxS4"&gt;This concept File Explorer also offers up a cleaner way to deal with images in folders, with a minimalist ribbon of options. There’s even nested folders on the side panel, allowing Windows users to quickly switch between folders that are buried deep in multiple folder structures. The breadcrumb bar has worked well for navigation at the top of the File Explorer for years, but this nested folders option offers even more ways to navigate around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI-F_tfre5N0nthEHeXpWMj8r4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445534/d24v4rfao5t61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This File Explorer concept also imagines how nested folders would work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="os25cz"&gt;Alur2020’s concept has proved &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/"&gt;popular over on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, with hundreds of comments praising the design, thousands of upvotes, and a number of Reddit awards. The concept comes just weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348639/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-new-icons-system-update"&gt;Microsoft unveiled new File Explorer icons&lt;/a&gt; as part of a larger visual overhaul for Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ON73aX"&gt;Microsoft has also created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10 this year, as part of a planned “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” codenamed “Sun Valley.” The company is expected to detail its Windows UI plans and more about the future of the OS in the coming months as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;dedicated news event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Experience now optimizes settings for creative apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_dC01ffSimR3w9c8JJfjka0CuM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129299/NVIDIA_Studio_Optimal_Settings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ua1U8O"&gt;Nvidia has &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/14/studio-gtc-apr-14/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new feature for its GeForce Experience software that helps users of creative applications make sure they’re getting the best performance out of their GPUs. GeForce Experience can now tell you whether you have the best settings enabled for more than 30 creative apps including DaVinci Resolve, Adobe’s Lightroom and Illustrator, and Autodesk’s AutoCAD. If certain GPU features aren’t active, you can turn them on from within GeForce Experience itself “with a single button press.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wdtG3"&gt;For example, DaVinci Resolve users can automatically optimize settings for GPU acceleration in various modes, which may or may not have been switched on already. The idea is that GeForce Experience can now be a central hub for creative apps that helps you maximize performance. Nvidia isn’t doing anything specific here to actually improve how the apps work — though it is also releasing a new Studio Driver today for creative software — this is just a convenient way to make sure that you’ve set them up in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlyN5F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia focuses further on creators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2aIAAX"&gt;GeForce Experience is an application for Nvidia GPU owners that’s usually associated with gaming-related functionality. For example, Nvidia releases “Game Ready Drivers” through GeForce Experience that optimizes new games for its GPUs, and the application can serve as a launcher for those games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3qs7R"&gt;With this move, the software is further expanding its focus to encompass creative users as well, which is an area that Nvidia continues to concentrate on. Earlier today the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383572/open-broadcaster-software-obs-nvidia-noise-removal-rtx-voice-broadcast"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that its RTX-powered audio noise removal feature would be directly integrated into Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), the popular streaming software.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang and Olufsen’s latest speaker disappears into your bookshelf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuFnBC2uAegi9TLsdcL8eDwFkh8=/0x1:1920x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129265/Beosound_Emerge_0037.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emerge’s design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXyBDB"&gt;Bang and Olufsen’s latest connected speaker is the Emerge. Its thin form-factor should blend right in to most bookshelves, and that’s no accident. In a press release &lt;a href="https://press.bang-olufsen.com/d/gKpSDxqk8eyT/news#/april-2021/bang-olufsen-introduces-beosound-emerge-an-incredibly-slim-yet-powerful-home-speaker"&gt;announcing the speaker&lt;/a&gt;, the company says its design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book” with side panels that wrap around like a cover, and a logo on the front that’s meant to evoke a title printed on the spine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJuu6"&gt;It’s a nice contrast from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9470909/40000-speaker-bang-olufsen"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of Bang and Olufsen’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17795192/bang-olufsen-edge-speaker-price-release-date-ifa-2018"&gt;previous speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have had huge, hulking form-factors that are hard to imagine in any normal home. Instead, the Emerge takes a similar approach to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;Ikea’s Symfonisk speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have pulled double duty as lamps or shelving to help them blend in with the rest of your furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ej1XNnSteAinXaMG66GaGIq6uyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445488/Beosound_Emerge_0041.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get it? Like a title on a book spine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jM8rD4"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the Emerge speaker’s small form-factor shouldn’t make it a slouch in the sound quality department, however. “The vision for Beosound Emerge was to create the slimmest speaker possible that could still deliver full range, ultra-wide sound despite its size through its revolutionary driver configuration,” says the company’s head of product management Christoffer Poulsen. Internally there’s a triple-driver configuration consisting of a 4-inch woofer, a 1.45-inch mid-range, and a 0.6-inch tweeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ5ETC"&gt;In terms of connectivity, the Emerge supports all the standards you’d expect out of a modern connected speaker. There’s Spotify Connect support, Bluetooth 5.0, Airplay 2, and Chromecast streaming, as well as a built-in microphone with Google Assistant support. Physical connections include a line-in/optical jack, Ethernet, and a USB-C port for power. And yes, you can pair two Emerge’s together to create a stereo pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snGSOu"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the speaker uses the same replaceable connectivity module that appeared in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264409/bang-and-olufsen-beosound-level-modular-streaming-smart-speaker-bluetooth-airplay"&gt;recent Beosound Level&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow it to receive “new performance updates and features for years to come.” Eventually this module can be replaced if it gets outdated, B&amp;amp;O says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGB7po"&gt;The Bang and Olufsen Emerge is available in select European markets starting today, and will release globally this autumn. Pricing starts at £539 / €599 9around $717) for the black model, while the gold model which has an oak wood cover costs slightly more at £669 / €749 (around $879).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can finally ‘inquire to buy’ LG’s rollable TV in the United States</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ifhZfIuKMiDAUC6ATWqz4JzhC0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69128432/cwelch_190107_3143_lgoled_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UBIzWt"&gt;We may never see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;LG’s incredible rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; come to market, now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;its smartphone days are done&lt;/a&gt;, but at least the rollable TV we’ve been eagerly tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866060/lg-display-rollable-oled-tv-65-inch-ces-2018"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; is finally making it to the United States. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Flg-signature%2Frollable-oled-tv-r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22384789%2Flg-rollable-tv-usa-united-states-price-release-date-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can now “inquire to buy” one&lt;/a&gt; at the company’s website, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://hdguru.com/lg-quietly-fielding-inquiries-in-u-s-for-rollable-oled-r-tvs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HD Guru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-rollable-oled-r-available-us-222137792.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98g18O"&gt;While the company doesn’t list a price, we highly doubt you’ll nab one for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054005/lg-rollable-oled-4k-tv-shipping-price-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;the $60,000 originally promised&lt;/a&gt;; the motorized TV-in-a-box &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;went on sale in South Korea&lt;/a&gt; last October for 100 million won, or over $89,000 in today’s US dollars. We also wouldn’t be surprised if you have to pay for more than just the TV itself, seeing how we reached the voicemail of a “custom integration specialist” when we called the provided number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijQ78S"&gt;While the rollable TV will be quite the conversation piece, you should also know it’s a couple years behind the times when it comes to certain specs and image processing. Then again, if you’re the kind of person who can afford one, you can probably retire to the bedroom when you crave more power, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/27/21723138/samsung-98-inch-tv-deal-sale-black-friday-8k"&gt;your 98-inch 8K set&lt;/a&gt; is no doubt ready to embrace you with every one of its 33 million pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goodbye, funky hacks: you’ll soon be able to download albums on the Spotify desktop app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biwCHYYymRmaLMwyZlMKgHrfxxg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127866/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI2zLe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-25/introducing-a-new-spotify-experience-across-desktop-app-and-web-player/"&gt;Spotify’s desktop app refresh&lt;/a&gt; seems to be rolling out to users, and it brings with it a very handy feature: album downloads. The app has supported downloading playlists to your computer for quite a while. The update should make it easier to keep your library managed if you want to keep the music going even when you’re offline. It is worth noting that this feature is limited to Premium subscribers — according to Spotify’s documentation, free users are only able to download podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PukiGg"&gt;Downloading an album works similarly to downloading a playlist: just navigate to the album’s page and press the download button. It should then be available the next time &lt;a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/listen-offline/"&gt;you go into Offline mode&lt;/a&gt;. This should make it easier to manage your offline library if you’re the type of person who’s very particular about what you want to listen to. (For example, I had a carefully curated playlist called “Downloads” that I would dump songs and albums into as a workaround to not being able to save individual things for offline listening.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pcd0e7zo3xrpiKlsp_bvUkhnkbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444463/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now I can download individual albums and set my Downloads playlist free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVmau"&gt;The update also features tweaks to the look of the desktop and web player, as well as how playlist management works. It appears to be currently rolling out — some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff got it yesterday, others today. So if you’re not seeing it, just hang tight. You should see a screen letting you know that you’ve got the update.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A74ZJo4uGApYH1E0e467pzs6g1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444480/image__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who doesn’t love offline use?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PLAw0r"&gt;Use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine remains paused in the United States as officials gather more information about the rare clots reported in six people who got the shot. An independent advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it didn’t have enough information yet to say which groups might be at risk of the clots or to recommend who should get this vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxuo3v"&gt;“I don’t think we have enough information today,” said Grace Lee, associate chief medical officer for practice innovation at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in California, during the committee’s meeting on Wednesday. The group will reconvene as rapidly as possible — likely next week — after gathering more data and evaluating that information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G5E2F"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Tuesday morning that the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;pause use&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine in light of six reports of unusual blood clots in people who got the shot. Although there is no proven relationship between the clots and the vaccine, and the events are probably rare, the agencies wanted time to investigate the reports and give doctors information on how to treat the condition. The agencies said Tuesday that they hoped to resolve the pause as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B2i8Dx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The agencies said Tuesday that they hoped to resolve the pause as quickly as possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WVe4Dx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/14/johnson-johnson-vaccine-pause-whos-affected/"&gt;Underserved communities&lt;/a&gt; in the US are most affected by a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson pause. The easy-to-store, one-shot vaccine was being used for homebound seniors, at pop-up clinics in rural areas, and for people experiencing homelessness. The effect of this pause on those groups was a serious topic of conversation during the meeting today. “This one and done vaccine that didn’t require the cold chain is a significant loss,” said Camille Kotton, the clinical director of transplant and immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. That group, though, might have the most challenges getting treatment for a clot if they do develop one, noted Helen Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9a2B3"&gt;The CDC received the six reports between March 19th and April 12th through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Unusually, all six patients had cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (a type of blood clot in the brain) in combination with low levels of platelets, a type of blood cell involved in clotting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="brVGST"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RRYHx1"&gt;The CDC was keeping a special eye out for reports of these clots because of the issues seen with the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/07/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-linked-to-blood-clots/"&gt;AstraZeneca vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in Europe and the United Kingdom, Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, said during the committee meeting. “This is a really good example of how robust the US vaccine safety monitoring system is and how in this case, during a large-scale national mass vaccination program, the system worked in various functions exactly as planned,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ayk4lD"&gt;The COVID-19 working group at the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met earlier this week to go over the reports. The six people who had clots were all young women. Even though they were rare, they occurred at a higher-than-expected rate in that group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9VQtd"&gt;Sara Oliver, an epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04/05-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during today’s meeting that the working group noted how much we still don’t know about these clots. It’s not clear how often the combination of both the clots and low platelets would normally appear in the general population, which makes it difficult to say how far above the norm these reports are. We also don’t have a good sense of the risk factors for developing this condition. There also could still be more reports — nearly 4 million people received doses in the past two weeks, and those people are still in a window where a clot may occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PUw8Kl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine isn’t the only shot available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlFICg"&gt;The group also noted that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine isn’t the only shot available in the US. Officials aren’t seeing the same problems in people who got the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Only around 5 percent of vaccines given in the US so far were the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXQD1D"&gt;“We are very fortunate because we have multiple other alternatives in the US to end the health pandemic,” Talbot said. “We’re in a different position and can be more cautious.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2d8hb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVrUUD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10’s Timeline feature is going away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o-ts_3kNOlrALTUPkU-VhXmVJ1E=/16x0:2392x1584/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127703/Screen_Shot_2021_04_14_at_5.21.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEMbfp"&gt;Windows 10 is officially losing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15610612/microsoft-windows-10-timeline-feature"&gt;once-ambitious Timeline feature&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft announced today. Timeline, first launched in 2017, was designed to make it easier for users to swap between multiple devices — transitioning seamlessly from a Windows 10 PC to an Android or iOS phone and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87JrNs"&gt;It’s no surprise that Timeline is getting deprecated: it was a feature that heavily relied on Microsoft’s Cortana assistant, which would prompt users to resume tasks from device to device. Cortana was a particularly important part of building out the Timeline experience on iOS and Android devices, where Microsoft (obviously) had less control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uirryj"&gt;Given that Cortana’s prevalence in Windows has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349827/microsoft-cortana-shutdown-devices-ios-android"&gt;heavily diminished&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/16/20967875/microsoft-cortana-ios-android-app-removal-countries-support-document"&gt;the mobile apps completely discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, it makes sense that Microsoft would sunset Timeline as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3LIeX"&gt;The news was announced as part of the changelog for the &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21359/"&gt;Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 21359&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0Kmr2M"&gt;If you have your activity history synced across your devices through your Microsoft account (MSA), you’ll no longer have the option to upload new activity in Timeline. AAD-connected accounts won’t be impacted. To view web history, Edge and other browsers have the option to look back at recent web activities. You can also view recently used files using OneDrive and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CquIKS"&gt;Insider build users should already see the changes once they’ve installed the new update, while users on the standard update track should see the removal of Timeline in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUlxxV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has changed its blog post and contacted us to say that Timeline is not actually going away, only “a capability within Timeline that is specific to roaming across devices.” But since the whole point of Timeline is roaming across devices, it still sounds like the feature as we know it is dying. We’re asking Microsoft for clarification. The company’s blog post now adds: “Note: Timeline and all your local activity history still remain on Windows 10.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook sign public letter supporting voting rights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Georgians Go To The Polls In Critical Senate Runoff Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAygLURtchrk9l3qXiPKGnV_IZo=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127514/1294607789.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4hB9rh"&gt;Amazon, Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, and Facebook have joined hundreds of corporations, executives, and celebrities in signing a public letter today supporting voting rights and condemning legislation that would “restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/ceos-corporate-america-voting-rights.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50cX9m"&gt;The public letter appeared as a full-page ad in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday and was organized by former American Express credit card company executive Kenneth Chenault, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, and the Black Economic Alliance. You can see an image of the ad, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dgelles/status/1382293992705028100?s=20"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; reporter David Gelles&lt;/a&gt;, below: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zzZqbE1bKWaWp7yKUunabIcTIOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443984/Ey7kSH_WEAAaJe_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The letter as it appeared in &lt;/em&gt;The New York Times&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vzXFDg"&gt;The text reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sH9bz8"&gt;WE STAND FOR DEMOCRACY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsTWEP"&gt;A Government of the people, by the people. A beautifully American ideal, but a reality denied to many for much of this nation’s history. As Americans we know that in our democracy we should not expect to agree on everything. However, regardless of our political affiliations, we believe the very foundation of our electoral process rests upon the ability of each of us to cast our ballots for the candidate of our choice. For American democracy to work for any of us, we must ensure the right to vote for all of us. We should feel a responsibility to defend the right to vote and to oppose any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot. Voting is the lifeblood of our democracy and we call upon all Americans to join us in taking a nonpartisan stand for this most basic and fundamental right of all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ePOjzB"&gt;Supporting voting rights is an unfortunately evergreen issue in the US, but this letter is particularly timely because of Georgia’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22352112/georgia-voting-sb-202-explained"&gt;recently passed SB 202&lt;/a&gt;. Georgia’s new bill puts more power over voter eligibility in the hands of Republican state officials and requires voters to provide personal ID when using absentee ballots, among other restrictions. The bill has been heavily criticized by activists, law experts, and other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360514/microsoft-georgia-election-integrity-act-blog-brad-smith-voting-rights"&gt;like Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which signed onto today’s letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKJViI"&gt;Other companies, like Coca-Cola, Delta, Home Depot, Walmart, and JP Morgan Chase declined to sign the letter, &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;writes. Both Coca-Cola and Delta spoke out against the  Georgia law after being threatened with boycotts online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvuhAn"&gt;Statements like these are all fine and good, but when it comes down to it, saying you support voting rights with a national ad is the mega corporation equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21359098/social-justice-slideshows-instagram-activism"&gt;reposting a social justice slideshow&lt;/a&gt; on your Instagram story. It can raise awareness and give people an idea of where a person or company stands, but it’s only committing to words and beliefs rather than actions. Companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, Facebook, and every other business signing this letter “vote” with their money. And history has shown that they’re either not willing to spend much — in the case of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;supporting racial justice&lt;/a&gt; — or have reportedly opposed stronger voter protection bills at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZeQ7O"&gt;Several of the companies that signed today’s letter (including Microsoft) are also members of the US Chamber of Congress, the trade association that &lt;a href="https://www.uschamber.com/letters-congress/us-chamber-key-vote-letter-s-1-the-the-people-act"&gt;recently urged senators&lt;/a&gt; to vote down a federal voting rights bill that passed in the House of Representatives, writes &lt;a href="https://thebrick.house/companies-signing-voting-rights-statement-are-members-of-anti-hr-1-lobbying-group/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sludge (&lt;/em&gt;part of the&lt;em&gt; Brick House &lt;/em&gt;journalism cooperative&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, called the For The People Act or S.1/H.R. 1, aims to guarantee voter protections like automatic voter registration and mail-in ballots, even in states like Georgia with their own restrictive voting limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hegg5"&gt;Where do these companies actually stand, then? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase is on the Nasdaq, in case you want to bet on cryptocurrency using dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5AsioAuv4xFFq-MCKnIgxyqevg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127478/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1qHDV"&gt;The nice thing about Coinbase going public today is that if you want to get involved with cryptocurrency without ever leaving the almighty dollar, now you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoyDnF"&gt;On Tuesday, Nasdaq &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-stock-price-valuation-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-11618413312"&gt;set $250 as a reference price&lt;/a&gt; for Coinbase, though no one necessarily bought at that price because this is a direct listing. Coinbase closed trading today at $328.28, giving it a market cap of $85.8 billion, more than that of the company behind the Nasdaq exchange. It’s yet another marker for how normal cryptocurrency has become — and how much easier it is for normies to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWywO9"&gt;Recall, if you can, the early 2000s: banking crisis, panicked market, excited cypherpunks. The idea behind bitcoin was relatively simple: it emerged from a specific distrust of financial institutions. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166096/bitcoin-blockchain-code-currency-money-genesis-block-silk-road-mt-gox"&gt;early ethos evaporated some time ago&lt;/a&gt;, obviously — and now, the likes of Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk shill for bitcoin and have gotten their respective companies (Square, Tesla) to invest in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APwFMW"&gt;Coinbase is part of the story, too. It’s one of the easiest ways to go from the dollar to cryptocurrency, and it’s now the largest bitcoin exchange in the US. If you were hesitant to deal with cryptocurrency itself — maybe because you were worried you’d put a wallet on a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/man-lost-127-million-worth-of-bitcoins-and-city-wont-let-him-look.html"&gt;hard drive and lose the hard drive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;forget the password&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/the-strange-tale-of-quadriga-gerald-cotten"&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt; — investing in Coinbase is a less risky way to get in on the trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pnoj8V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BTC in 2012 was about $6. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$300k @ $6 = 50k BTC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today 50k BTC = $3.2bn &lt;a href="https://t.co/JiOT7MXEl4"&gt;https://t.co/JiOT7MXEl4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Colin Platt (@colingplatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/colingplatt/status/1382364944222535684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyT900"&gt;Maybe that’s the point. Because in theory, rather than going public on the stock market, Coinbase could have done an initial coin offering. You can productively think of an ICO as a cryptocurrency version of offering securities — the Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ICO"&gt;often does&lt;/a&gt;. Had Coinbase done this, it would have offered a token that investors could have bought on cryptocurrency exchanges. That token could, in theory, substitute for stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sWJIc"&gt;But the fact that I’m writing about a direct listing tells you this didn’t happen. It’s possible that Coinbase’s investors wanted to go public rather than deal with an ICO because it’s more predictable. Maybe there were other considerations! Whatever the reason, this choice has given Coinbase a remarkable opportunity. Investors who don’t want to get involved in cryptocurrency directly but see upside potential can use their dollars to buy into Coinbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ldxZE"&gt;It doesn’t hurt that Coinbase is profitable and &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-q1-earnings-report-monthly-active-users"&gt;just had a fabulous first quarter&lt;/a&gt;, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSlq4H"&gt;Using Coinbase as a proxy investment might also explain the valuation, which critics have suggested is too high. Some people have suggested that, as cryptocurrency matures, there will be &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-buy-coinbase-the-valuation-is-ridiculous-11618254467"&gt;less need for Coinbase’s services&lt;/a&gt;. Some say Coinbase’s fees may scare customers into &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbases-lofty-valuation-might-erode-as-crypto-markets-mature-11618047180"&gt;using other services&lt;/a&gt;. But if Coinbase is a proxy investment, then the underlying business isn’t all that’s going into the valuation. You might not make as much money investing in Coinbase as you could investing in bitcoin — but it might be less risky. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MyPillow CEO’s free speech social network will ban posts that take the Lord’s name in vain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MyPillow and FrankSpeech founder Mike Lindell, seen outside the White House during the final weeks of the Trump administration." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntspa7Np4JZ34nVlye9mwLk8PfY=/0x0:5279x3519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127313/1230603856.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kofcnW"&gt;After a public break with Facebook and Twitter, MyPillow founder Mike Lindell is getting close to the launch of a new conservative-focused social network, giving more detail on the project &lt;a href="https://frankspeech.com/"&gt;in a video posted online this week&lt;/a&gt;. Called simply “Frank,” the social network plans to open its doors to a limited set of users on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70oljN"&gt;Developed in the months since the 2020 election, Lindell &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7mw48/mike-lindell-mypillow-ceo-starting-vocl-social-network"&gt;has described the project&lt;/a&gt; as a combination of “print, radio, and TV,” offering both text posts and live stream capability. Perhaps the strangest promise is that conservative personalities will have significantly more followers on the fledgling network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQss00"&gt;“People are going to have more followers,” Lindell said in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RightWingWatch/status/1370072480233234432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1370072480233234432%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fv7mw48%2Fmike-lindell-mypillow-ceo-starting-vocl-social-network"&gt;a March interview with Steve Bannon&lt;/a&gt;, “10 times more followers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpkivG"&gt;In the more recent video, Lindell explained that the new network would still moderate against profanity and threats of violence — setting it apart from previous right-wing platforms like Parler and Gab, which prided themselves on their refusal to censor offensive speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpDveb"&gt;“You don’t get to use the four swear words: the c-word, the n-word, the f-word, or God’s name in vain,” Lindell says in the video. Instituting that policy will present a significant challenge to conventional automated moderation programs, which are adept at identifying specific strings of text but have no system to distinguish between devout and profane invocations of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49MRiE"&gt;To avoid deplatforming efforts from app stores, the Frank social network is formatted as a web app and accessed by navigating to the site from a mobile browser. This means it doesn’t have to comply with Apple and Google store guidelines, but it also severely limits the app’s functionality. The Frank site gives detailed instructions for how users can set up the Frank web app as a direct icon link (similar to an installed app) on mobile devices under both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVOBWC"&gt;Lindell first announced the project on Bannon’s podcast in March, out of frustration with the mass deplatforming of claims that the 2020 election had been somehow stolen from Donald Trump. The new platform would avoid restrictions put in place by app stores, instead promoting “voices of free speech,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7mw48/mike-lindell-mypillow-ceo-starting-vocl-social-network"&gt;Lindell said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0yKOo"&gt;Despite extensive and well-funded investigations, advocates have produced no credible evidence of mass voter fraud in the 2020 election. Lindell is currently facing a $1.3 billion defamation case &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/dominion-sues-mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-over-pro-trump-election-conspiracies.html"&gt;from Dominion Voting Systems&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his claims about the election.&lt;/p&gt;
