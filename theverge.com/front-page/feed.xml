    <title>Dolby Vision gaming launches first on Xbox Series X and S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uosqD5UN_0qOXq3dtn21a65r73M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919475/dolbyvisionxboxseriesx.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dolby Vision is now available on Microsoft’s latest Xbox consoles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cNsoaQ"&gt;Microsoft is bringing Dolby Vision gaming support to its Xbox Series X / S consoles today. The feature has been in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435864/microsoft-dolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-test"&gt;testing since May&lt;/a&gt; and will be available in more than 100 HDR games. While Xbox has supported the HDR10 standard for years, Dolby Vision gaming is appearing first on Xbox consoles and offers support for dynamic metadata. Microsoft says this should result in “brighter highlights, sharper contrast, and more vibrant colors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omvwIl"&gt;“There are more than 100 next-gen HDR titles optimized for Series X / S that will feature Dolby Vision today, and in the future you’ll see more games like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; taking full advantage of Dolby Vision,” explains Katie Slattery, an Xbox program manager at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtUKvF"&gt;Microsoft has also been working with Dolby to bring some benefits of Dolby Vision to existing HDR10 and Auto HDR games. Microsoft is bringing “new visual enhancement capabilities that utilize Dolby Vision technology to deliver an improved visual experience for thousands of existing HDR10 and Auto HDR games,” says Slattery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EePB8eJdHE9p7-Gocpx8Ny27nSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884192/dolbyvisionxboxseriesx.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox consoles are the first to support Dolby Vision for gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2cHWp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers can choose to enable Dolby Vision in game engines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyWtH4"&gt;Developers can choose between integrating Dolby Vision into their game engine or taking advantage of the built-in Dolby Vision technology within the Xbox developer platform. Games that use Auto HDR aren’t true Dolby Vision games, but Microsoft says they’ll benefit from the Dolby Vision mapping technology on Xbox to display more accurate images on Dolby Vision TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk9vQu"&gt;You’ll need a compatible Dolby Vision TV to take advantage of this new feature on the Xbox Series X / S consoles, and Microsoft is also recommending enabling automatic low-latency mode (ALLM). Dolby Vision is compatible with ALLM, Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and 120Hz games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwBSoM"&gt;You can check in Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; TV &amp;amp; display options &amp;gt; 4K TV details to see whether your TV will support Dolby Vision. If it does, you can enable Dolby Vision gaming support in Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; TV &amp;amp; display options &amp;gt; Video Modes &amp;gt; Dolby Vision for Gaming. You may need the latest TV firmware update to enable Dolby Vision or 120Hz modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeHoGs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse needs creators, but creators need cash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gzBeY8U8ZTBhvPDWcWmaT3s1ZIs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919477/Image_from_iOS__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Tarik Mask&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hosts looked to Clubhouse for sponsors — it rarely delivered&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YQfkvN"&gt;Dozens of Clubhouse creators had been anticipating their first sponsorship meeting for months. As the inaugural class of Clubhouse’s &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/creator-first-accelerator/"&gt;“Creator First” program&lt;/a&gt;, they were supposed to receive Clubhouse’s help landing sponsorships and turning their shows into a “profitable creative endeavor.” The creators wrote down lists of brands they wanted to speak with and prepared one-sheets pitching their live audio shows. But when the time came, it turned out they weren’t getting one-on-one meetings with the brands; instead, they would be pitching their shows to a public room on Clubhouse, alongside dozens of other creators, where anyone on the app could join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8pARO"&gt;“It was a real big joke,” says Cyndi Pham, a creator from the program and a media consultant herself. “I feel like [making it public] was something they did to save face because they couldn’t get any sponsors to show up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuBSF2"&gt;The creators each had two minutes or so to pitch their programs to the sponsors in the crowd. “Dozens of agencies and brands attended,” according to a Clubhouse spokesperson. But technical difficulties tripped up multiple creators, preventing them from speaking. Clubhouse told the creators they’d hear more after the event and that interest was pouring in. But the contacts never surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29OKHC"&gt;“I received no email, so either that means nobody was interested in my show, nobody came, or I haven’t gotten the information,” says one creator who asked to remain anonymous because of their ongoing relationship with the Clubhouse team. “And I suspected the second one: that nobody came.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MeVJWO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The program culminated in a public showcase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bS2H56"&gt;Six creators from Clubhouse’s creator program say no brands sponsored them before the end of the program, and Clubhouse failed to turn any of their shows into sustainable endeavors, as it advertised it would. None of them plan to keep doing their high-production shows, and many are refocusing their efforts on other platforms, simply because they have a better shot at being compensated for their effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbVpGo"&gt;The creator program’s troubles suggest bigger potential issues for Clubhouse, which is reportedly valued at $4 billion. If Clubhouse can’t entice brands to put their cash behind its hand-selected, premium content, how will it keep creators on the platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKeeXT"&gt;“[Clubhouse has] a whole cohort of creators who mastered this craft, and now they’ve got to figure out how to make it a living,” says Owen Muir, a psychiatrist who hosted a mental health-focused show with his wife Carlene MacMillan for the program. “And Clubhouse is going to help us do it, or someone else will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNwzoh"&gt;It’s unclear how much money Clubhouse is making right now, despite its unicorn status. It has partnerships with some major organizations — like TED and the NFL — but the details of those deals aren’t public. And critically, Clubhouse isn’t directly monetizing the typical live audio rooms its users host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8usrNn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Six Clubhouse creators say they received no sponsorships through Clubhouse’s team&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xm0ni"&gt;Creators themselves also have no way to regularly monetize their shows like they do on other platforms. Right now, Clubhouse only offers tipping as a way for hosts to make money off their rooms, and the creators I spoke with say they rarely, if ever, received a tip. There’s no automatic insertion of ads, and sponsors seemingly don’t understand how the platform works even if they might be interested. One creator says they had to spend a significant amount of time educating potential guests and others about how the app functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmYEJP"&gt;Clubhouse said “a number” of the &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/creator-first-inaugural-class/"&gt;25 Creator First shows&lt;/a&gt; landed sponsorships and gave three examples in a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But of the three names Clubhouse provided, only one might have come through Clubhouse’s team itself. The others either resulted from the creator’s established relationships or through another Clubhouse creator who is unaffiliated with the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4gdgc"&gt;Even when sponsors did show interest, Clubhouse’s tools made it hard to support them. Pham, who arguably had one of the most successful shows from a monetization standpoint, had issues validating sponsorships, given that Clubhouse barely provided analytics. She says she and the other participants received the number of unique listeners, the total number of minutes spent listening, and the number of listeners a room had at its maximum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDxZhj"&gt;“Obviously, if you know anything about sponsorships, that means nothing to anybody,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0eKhB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Crvchz"&gt;The creators point out they received no demographic information about their listeners, something brands need and want to see. In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Clubhouse says it doesn’t collect demographic data. There are also no in-app links within rooms or a way to designate that a room is sponsored, apart from saying so in the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNZ0UM"&gt;“I think when [Clubhouse] first came out, it was so buzzy that there were brands willing to sign on because of the buzz,” MacMillan says. “It was a very cool place to be. I think now that it is a little bit more mainstream, they need more than that to sign on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqSUJ0"&gt;Clubhouse gave creators a $15,000 stipend to cover the length of the program, although that was on per-show basis, meaning co-hosts split the cash. Creators were also given new equipment, like iPhones, if needed; a producer to assist them; a creative agency partner to make visual assets; and the Clubhouse team’s direct line for advice or to vent. Everyone who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were proud of the shows they made, despite likely not being able to continue them because they need to focus on supporting themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgqpJG"&gt;Some of Clubhouse’s other advertised perks never surfaced. The team said it would help them book high-profile guests, for instance, but Clubhouse only named three connections made when reached for comment. Creators were also told they’d receive promotion both within and outside the app — another thing that barely occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDxIU8"&gt;“We had to beg for tweets [about our shows],” says another participant who asked to remain anonymous because they fear retaliation from the Clubhouse team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uAklvb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse’s analytics pale in comparison to other platforms’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJjCrY"&gt;The company’s biggest promotional tool was the Clubhouse staff itself, these creators say. If a staff member entered a room, that meant more people would see it in their hallway, or the app’s main landing page. Stephanie Simon, Clubhouse’s head of community and content, for example, has over 3 million followers, so when she joins a room, all of them should see it prominently on the app’s homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qdbyo"&gt;“They will use their staff to drive traffic,” MacMillan says. “That seemed to be the major mechanism, which is helpful, but you have to rely on that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9AU2p"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Clubhouse spokesperson said: “At Clubhouse we move quickly, build in public, talk with the community, and ship improvements each week based on what they tell us. We think that’s a more human approach, more transparent, and if we are going to make social audio better, we need to be committed to listening about what works and what needs work. The inaugural Creator First program has proven invaluable for feedback and will help us refine this program and design better features for the entire Clubhouse community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5NBNe"&gt;The creators I spoke with say they plan to continue using Clubhouse in some capacity — they all love the community on the app — but they’re sketching out a new strategy: how they can keep making content and get paid for doing it, which likely means less time or effort going into Clubhouse. For many, making their Creator First show took hours every week, whether it was prepping in the form of reading up on guests, scoring episodes with music, planning detailed run-of-shows, or emailing people trying to find someone to guest. Now that the stipend is over, they have to use that time to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZL2fz"&gt;Roderick Martin, for example, hosted a show about UFOs for the Creator First program. He’s found some success from YouTube — a TV show crew discovered him there and made him a host of a new program on Discovery Plus — and he also hosts a podcast. He says that if he now had a high-profile guest secured, particularly a guest that wants to be compensated for their time, he wouldn’t bring them to Clubhouse. He’d just lose money. Plus, the live Clubhouse show exists for only that period; there’s not yet a native recording function or archive that he could monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIUEFj"&gt;“I would have to make that ultimate decision and do a video-type podcast to where it can be placed on YouTube so that the monetization of YouTube over time — because this is going to live forever — can begin to make that asset generate revenue,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYJ2Gf"&gt;Another creator says they’re also weighing what to do with their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCQT25"&gt;“We’re better off turning this into a podcast, instead of doing it on Clubhouse, that then we could distribute, market, get sponsors‚ and it’s evergreen — it doesn’t disappear, people can find it — that might be a better use of our time,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otx5Xx"&gt;Meanwhile, nearly every social app has dedicated millions of dollars to bringing creators to their platform. Facebook announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;spend $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next year and a half to do so; Snapchat was giving away $1 million per day for months; and YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606291/youtube-shorts-fund-launches-100-million"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; a $100 million fund to encourage people to use its TikTok competitor. Even LinkedIn is &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/"&gt;dedicating millions&lt;/a&gt; to creators with the goal to specifically try out live social audio. Traditional podcasting apps are also offering subscription products that will help creators stay in touch with their listeners — Spotify and Patreon both give podcasters their listeners’ emails, something Clubhouse users don’t receive. Clubhouse isn’t giving up, either. It’s announced plans to continue the Creator First program in both India and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XYk0eJ"&gt;Clubhouse and its competitors are pulling from the same playbook. But the key difference between YouTube and Clubhouse is that its platform already generates revenue for lots of people. If Clubhouse wants more creators to join and make high-quality content, it’ll need to get sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YH9n2l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password gets its own ‘hide my email’ feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DT52J1eKe7YoXN29eNi9zrNIeF8=/130x0:2410x1520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919312/2_Create_alias__fill_alias.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password will let you create unique email address for each service.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 1Password&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="djW41o"&gt;1Password is launching a new feature to let users create unique email aliases for logins, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Plus Hide My Email function&lt;/a&gt;. 1Password is partnering with &lt;a href="https://www.fastmail.com/"&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; to bring its masked email feature to the password manager, giving all users the option of hiding their email addresses from apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYSkQO"&gt;“Your email address is your online identity,” explains Bron Gondwana, CEO of Fastmail. “If your credentials are compromised in a data breach, having a randomly generated email address adds a second line of defense because it can’t be associated with your primary email address, and therefore, your identity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g097CZymaQCBgjL6QIS-ybY0lwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884213/3_Suggested_password.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 1Password&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password will let you sign up to services with a unique email and password.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mlgin5"&gt;This new masked email feature will be ideal for registering accounts for temporary purposes, like a free Wi-Fi network. But they can also be used to hide your personal email address from any app or service as the aliases don’t expire unless a 1Password user manually deletes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU4lYB"&gt;Email aliases already exist in Gmail, Outlook, and other email services. If your regular email address is hello@gmail.com, you can simply use hello+secrethere@gmail.com and emails will appear in your hello@gmail.com inbox. Aliases are a good way to cut down on spam, but the &lt;a href="https://www.fastmail.com/1password/"&gt;1Password Fastmail integration&lt;/a&gt; takes it a step further by making it impossible for scammers to figure out your actual email address.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJsariilmJ8q3gJR8KwiXY-Ct4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884205/4_Save_Login.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 1Password&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masked emails will never expire in 1Password.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IzQumx"&gt;Attackers often use leaked databases of reused passwords and email addresses to phish people, but they need both your email address and password to access a service. Victims of a leaked data breach are at less risk if both their password and email address are unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grjwqb"&gt;Services like &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; have been tracking data breaches for years, and affected email addresses often appear in more than just one breach. “My service is now tracking 5 billion email addresses with each one appearing in an average of 2 data breaches,” says Troy Hunt, the founder of Have I Been Pwned and strategic advisor at 1Password. “It’s more important than ever that we protect our privacy; and protecting the primary key to our digital lives – our email address – will have a really positive impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There might be more to come from buzzy VR theme park The Void</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENTERTAINMENT-TECHNOLOGY-THE VOID" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5WNtrVCV1ppzjm-nSg_VGaHa70=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919246/1006824744.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Void attendees wearing the the company’s headsets and VR backpacks.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: VERONIQUE DUPONT/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8BY3ZD"&gt;VR arcade company The Void, which offered large-scale virtual reality experiences before financial difficulties forced it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570662/the-void-disney-star-wars-vr-arcade-loan-default"&gt;transfer its IP to a creditor late last year&lt;/a&gt;, is planning to make a comeback. &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/the-void-relaunch-hyper-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s assets have been acquired by a new company called Hyper Reality Partners, headed by a former investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqgwoU"&gt;The Void emerged as one of the more exciting VR arcade startups in recent years. With Disney as one of its highest-profile investors, the company offered large-scale multiplayer VR experiences, with some based on Hollywood franchises like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/3/16084460/star-wars-secrets-of-the-empire-disney-the-void-virtual-reality"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/16/17867110/the-void-wreck-it-ralph-breaks-vr-marvel-studios-disney-lucasfilm-ilm-virtual-reality-immersion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wreck-It Ralph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20897061/avengers-void-vr-black-panther-iron-man-shuri-tony-stark"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Attendees would strap on a modified VR headset and a backpack containing a computer to power it, and then walk around an environment that included interactable physical elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y8jVO8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It wants to “shape the future of VR and the entire entertainment industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UMkYeG"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://the-void.breezy.hr/"&gt;job listings site&lt;/a&gt; from Hyper Reality Partners confirms that the company has acquired The Void’s “assets and IP” and says that it’s now “entering a period of rapid expansion” with ambitions to “shape the future of VR and the entire entertainment industry.” &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reports that the company, headed by CEO Adrian Steckel, a former investor and board member of The Void, has raised $20 million for the relaunch. Joining Steckel are The Void’s old chief creative officer and VP of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWPH2y"&gt;Despite plenty of buzz, the startup found itself in financial difficulty last year after the pandemic forced it to close many of its locations. But &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports that it was experiencing difficulties before this, thanks to the high cost of hosting VR centers in popular shopping centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOIp1F"&gt;The Void’s experiences might look very different if they do end up making a return. For starters, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports that the company is looking to shift to offering experiences in large standalone entertainment complexes, rather than in pre-existing shopping malls. The VR hardware itself could also undergo changes thanks to the fact that much of its previous hardware was reportedly sold off, while the industry has also moved towards lighter standalone VR headsets that don’t require large backpacks for power.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Facebook should release the Facebook Files</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company’s least-bad option might also do a lot of good&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="T8MCqZ"&gt;The fallout from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt; series continues. On Sunday, the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;published a point-by-point rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s story on Instagram’s effects on teenage girls — and then on Monday morning, the company said&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt; it would “pause” plans to build Instagram Kids&lt;/a&gt; while it consults with more outside groups. A Senate hearing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;looms on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTKaiF"&gt;I spent the weekend talking to people in and around Facebook about the situation, and today I want to talk about what I think the company ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0rsiW"&gt;Inside Facebook, some people I’ve spoken with are feeling exasperated. They argue that the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;series uses relatively few data points to paint Facebook in the worst possible light. To them, it’s more evidence of bias from a press working to bring the company to its knees, reaching predetermined conclusions with whatever scraps of information they can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mI80y2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For others, the Facebook Files have been a welcome opportunity to discuss their greatest fear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Akw4rx"&gt;For others, though, particularly those who have worked on research and integrity initiatives, the Facebook Files have been a welcome opportunity to discuss their greatest fear: that despite researchers’ most worrisome findings, Facebook lacks the organizational structure and leadership necessary to prevent it from causing a wide range of preventable harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79Sja"&gt;Last week I said this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688976/facebook-research-scandals"&gt;situation represents Facebook’s most significant challenge since the Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; data privacy scandal. It’s not as &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; as Cambridge Analytica; the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; series has gotten less coverage overall. (Though that Senate hearing means the balance will continue to shift.) But if another story has generated a news cycle this intense or sustained since 2018, it’s news to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ud2lwJ"&gt;In the internal divisions over the Facebook Files, though, I find another echo of Cambridge Analytica. Then, too, there was a set of executives determined to fight back against what they perceived as an almost entirely bogus narrative — and another set that, while mostly in agreement with their peers, understood that the story had raised real fears about the company’s power and influence that would have to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtI45l"&gt;Last week I argued here that Facebook ought to address this situation by committing to doing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; research like that found in the Facebook Files, rather than less. We know Facebook executives believe that the company has positive overall benefits for the world, and we also know that they are meticulous students of their own data. It’s hard to understand why, if the data is so positive, Facebook is often so reluctant to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGSNCS"&gt;So why is that the case? One possibility is suggested by the Facebook Files: that the data about Facebook’s effects on societal issues like polarization, vaccine hesitancy, and children’s self-esteem are substantially negative, and must therefore be hidden. Another is that the data is substantially positive but must be hidden anyway, for reasons owing to run-of-the-mill corporate secrecy or a desire to deploy data more strategically, for PR reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6CU3G"&gt;Whatever the case, it seems clear that the current state of affairs is making everyone miserable. So today I want to expand my argument: Not only should Facebook commit to doing more research like the Facebook Files, it should release the Facebook Files, period. And not just the Instagram-related ones, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1442538461890744325?s=21"&gt;as Nick Clegg suggested Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever documents the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; relied on, Facebook should make them publicly available. Redact them as needed to protect users’ privacy, if need be. Add context, where context is missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYjLse"&gt;But release them, and soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plJsfL"&gt;Here’s my rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtUNr"&gt;One, the files are in the public interest. Among other things, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, they contain discussions of political parties who &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline"&gt;changed their policies based on changes to Facebook’s algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, they document &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;negative effects of using Instagram on mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and they reveal that the company &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953?mod=article_inline"&gt;devotes vastly more moderation resources to the United States than the rest of the world&lt;/a&gt;. On these subjects and more, the public simply has a right to know what Facebook does. One frustration I’ve had over the past week is that Facebook continues to be focused on the public-relations dimension of the story, when the public interest is much more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoW0KS"&gt;Two, the files will likely come out soon anyway: the whistleblower who leaked them to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; is apparently cooperating with Congress. Copies were shown in advance of publication to various researchers. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; may yet release them itself (I wish it would.) In any case, it seems likely that they are going to be available for all of us to read soon. Facebook could generate some (admittedly minor) amount of goodwill by doing it voluntarily. (Company spokesman Andy Stone told me&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1442274768061812736?s=21"&gt; the company is sharing the decks with Congress this week&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iXgybs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If they’re being taken out of context, provide the context&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQbz9E"&gt;Three, Facebook’s primary complaint about the series is that reporters allegedly&lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience"&gt; took key points out of context&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to credibly make that charge is to provide people with the full context. It’s not enough for the company’s head of research to describe one set of slides; to have an honest conversation about all this, we should all be looking at the same set of documents. If, as Facebook says, the majority of the research shows benign or even positive effects, it should have all the more reason to want us to read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvZVng"&gt;To be sure, the people inside Facebook arguing against the documents’ release have compelling points on their side, too. As soon as the files are made public, every tech reporter on earth will scour them in an effort to find angles that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; missed, extending the life of the story and perhaps even worsening the damage. Even if there are positive angles to be found within the data, there’s no guarantee that reporters will actually write them. And a narrow-minded focus on these documents crowds out a larger and equally important discussion of why we aren’t demanding similar research out of YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPIzLI"&gt;Moreover, the company was taken aback by the largely negative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;its Sunday night blog post received&lt;/a&gt;, I’m told. (I was&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1442264175128969219?s=21"&gt; one of the people negatively responding&lt;/a&gt;. So was Samidh Chakrabarti, Facebook’s just-departed former head of civic integrity efforts, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samidh/status/1442363126821769219?s=21"&gt; pointed out&lt;/a&gt; the blog post would have been more credible if it had been signed by the actual researchers who did the analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Q4Q5J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'd find blog posts like this much more persuasive if they were co-authored by the individual researchers who actually did the analysis. That would be a signal that they are willing to stand behind the comms team's characterization of their work. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2sO0UqedDQ"&gt;https://t.co/2sO0UqedDQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Samidh (@samidh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samidh/status/1442363126821769219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CkTBrS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/"&gt;The Sunday blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Pratiti Raychoudhury, the company’s head of research, is detailed and thoughtful in the way that it reflects on both the good and bad news in the company’s studies on how young Instagram users feel about themselves after using the app. The data is mixed, and people will draw different conclusions from it. The fact that so many critics dismissed her report out of hand, though, may have made the company reluctant to share more. &lt;em&gt;If this is the response we get&lt;/em&gt;, the argument goes, &lt;em&gt;what’s the point&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpexJZ"&gt;But none of these complaints is more important than the fact that sharing this data with the public is ultimately &lt;em&gt;the right thing to do&lt;/em&gt;. And it will be better for Facebook to share it on its own terms than on Congress’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLq9wS"&gt;And if Facebook &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to change perception, it could go a step further. Releasing the Facebook Files quickly is the company’s least-bad option. But the company knows that outside researchers will be skeptical of any findings they contain, because they can’t see the raw data. Even to the extent that the files exonerate Facebook from some criticisms, the underlying data is likely to remain under a cloud of suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sQoLNK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Let’s get a second, third, and fourth opinion of what the data shows about Instagram and teenagers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dYWbLr"&gt;That’s why, in addition to making the files public, Facebook should share the underlying data with qualified independent researchers in a privacy-preserving way. Let’s get a second, third, and fourth opinion of what the data shows about Instagram and teenagers. Given the recent revelation that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/10/facebook-error-data-social-scientists/"&gt;political-science data shared with researchers in 2020 was fatally flawed due to a bug&lt;/a&gt;, an unexpected gift of important new research material could help the company rebuild trust with researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8qfp7"&gt;Not everyone thinks this would be much of a gift: anyone can survey teens about their experiences on Instagram, after all, and among other things an independent study could recruit a larger sample. But to the extent that data in the Facebook Files can’t be easily accessed or replicated by independent researchers, Facebook should share as much as it can. The company’s efforts to share data with researchers to date have been halting and ineffectual. More transparency is coming to the platform one way or another; there’s still value in staking out a leadership position while the rest of the industry cowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRqb7x"&gt;I say release the Facebook Files for short-term goodwill, and release at least some of the data to qualified researchers for long-term credibility. Since it was founded, Facebook has relentlessly analyzed our actions and behavior, to its great benefit. However unjust it may feel today, it’s only fair that the company now take its turn under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Imgur has been bought by the owner of Kik, Genius, and WorldStarHipHop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/whVbLVC_SzdVnSasXBoS4JdaBsE=/81x0:891x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919062/Wh2Fsww.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lXOo0O"&gt;Popular image-sharing site Imgur has &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/We6yCM2"&gt;been acquired by MediaLab&lt;/a&gt;, a Santa Monica-based firm that describes itself as a “holding company of consumer internet brands.” The company owns a number of B-list tech and internet services, including messaging apps Kik and Whisper, lyrics annotator Genius, and viral video aggregator WorldStarHipHop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eChxds"&gt;Imgur, which currently claims some 300 million users, says the move will help the company “keep the main Imgur team focused on what we do best: creating the best place for community-powered entertainment online.” In a &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/We6yCM2"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said “Imgur’s journey is far from over” and that MediaLab is committing to “investing more resources in engineering and community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WSVFsv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MediaLab has bought a number of also-ran brands with sizable communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qNg6v"&gt;What exactly the acquisition means for the future of Imgur is unclear, but it’s hard to read this as positive news for the site. MediaLab isn’t explicit about its business model (you won’t find much information on &lt;a href="https://www.medialab.la/"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;), but it seems to be mainly focused on acquiring ailing brands with sizable, but stagnant, communities. Presumably, the goal is to bundle together traffic from these properties to sell ads or data, while cutting costs by sharing the work of keeping the sites running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eumCx"&gt;For example, the once-hyped Genius was bought by MediaLab &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/former-startup-darling-genius-sells-assets-for-80-million"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; for $80 million, reportedly less than what it had raised in venture capital over the years. Kik and Whisper were similarly once-hot properties that have since faded from prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMX1VB"&gt;Imgur itself has had a strange ride as a company. It was founded in 2009 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting/"&gt;gift to Reddit&lt;/a&gt;,” and its fortunes have risen and fallen along with this partnership. In 2016, Reddit decided to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/25/reddit-image-uploads/"&gt;host its own image uploads&lt;/a&gt;, and in response Imgur began to form itself into a standalone online community. It copied various social features popular on Reddit, including upvotes and downvotes on images, comment threads, and focused communities. The site has frequently been compared to other image-hosting services that grew adjacent to larger social media sites, such as Twitpic, but has so far laster longer on its own strengths. In recent years it has launched new features like an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21373988/imgur-emerald-subscription-service-announced-coil-micropayments"&gt;ad-free subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3foFgt"&gt;Imgur’s blog post announcing the acquisition reads like something close to a farewell note — “It’s been an absolute honor to create this corner of the internet alongside this incredible community” — though the company insists its “journey is far from over.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9w7DO"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTSIwZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android ‘12.1’ could be a big foldable-focused update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8OdJ8SFn1epyOijRKkEriIgrxg=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919029/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A redesigned lock screen could make better use of horizontal space.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7yC0QO"&gt;Big foldable-focused improvements are on the way for Android, if leaked code &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;analyzed by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-v2-update/"&gt;Previous reports&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that this year’s Android 12 is going to be followed by a minor revision, which is expected to be called Android 12.1 based on previous naming conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QafWK8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis suggests this update may deliver a host of improvements for how the operating system handles large foldable-sized screens, including offering a better split-screen UI, a lockscreen that makes better use of horizontal space, and a new taskbar that makes it easier to use multiple apps at once. They’re helpful additions that should reduce the need for manufacturers like Samsung to build their own foldable-focused UI improvements on top of Android for their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbzYpIGNs8Nn9ZIr_ge74H-Qess=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884146/Android_12.1_dual_pane_notifications_1024x836.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viewing Android’s Quick Settings and notifications panel simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KwQpKQ"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;XDA’s&lt;/em&gt; analysis notes, most of the improvements relate to how the operating system makes better use of more horizontal screen real estate. For example, it allows the Quick Settings and notifications panels to be displayed simultaneously side-by-side (rather than one-at-a-time), while the lock screen can now be split to show the clock on one side and notifications on the other. When it comes time to enter a PIN or password, this can now be placed on the left or right of the display (rather than centered) to allow it to be entered with one hand on a foldable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElMCrV"&gt;Android 12.1 is also designed to make it easier to use apps in split-screen. There’s a new shortcut in the recent apps menu to open an app in split-screen mode, rather than having to long press an app’s icon. Meanwhile, a new taskbar on the bottom of the screen can also be used to open recent apps in split-screen mode by dragging and dropping them onto either half of the screen. &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;reports that it might eventually be possible to drag notifications to open their apps in split-screen mode. Finally, the Settings app also appears to be getting a new interface that allows top-level menu items to be displayed on the left, while its submenus open on the right half of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9udA6aBjhBIGRYXMDS327gGtFj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884143/Android_12.1_split_screen_UI_1024x836.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A taskbar with access to recent apps on the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="78Z92c"&gt;Other non-foldable focused enhancements include being able to tweak the amount of time you have to hold the power button to activate the Google Assistant, and making it easier for manufacturers other than Google to match their system colors to Android 12’s lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rvt3jl"&gt;Google is yet to officially announce anything resembling Android 12.1, nor has it even released Android 12 to the general public. That means the features detailed by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; could change a lot before they’re released, if they’re ever released at all. But combined with the persistent rumors about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Google releasing a foldable phone&lt;/a&gt; this year, it’s looking increasingly likely that we’ll see some of these features arrive sooner rather than later. Be sure to check out the full list of changes &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;over on &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s MX Keys Mini ditches the numpad for other useful keys</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech MX Keys Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R_sVMwy530cGDgXNHtsv8GI2QjU=/0x0:1570x1047/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918951/mxkeysminihero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The function row has dedicated emoji, voice dictation and mic mute keys.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KNMukU"&gt;Logitech’s MX Keys Mini is a compact, platform-agnostic wireless keyboard that lacks the numpad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848369/logitech-mx-master-3-keys-best-mouse-even-better-magnetic-scroll-wheel"&gt;found on the standard MX Keys&lt;/a&gt;. It costs the same amount at $99.99 despite its smaller size, yet there might be enough additions to make this one the preferable option (you know, if spending $100 on a keyboard is feasible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUzvYT"&gt;Logitech added a dedicated emoji key to the top row of Mini’s function keys that lets you add some personality to your messages, in addition to a voice dictation key and a mic mute key that mutes on a system level, not per application. Joining them on the function row are media and volume keys, along with an option to adjust the brightness of the keyboard backlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aX1q5z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJ1WFVLTkD0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bs0Lx1"&gt;The MX Keys Mini charges via USB-C and can flip between three Bluetooth devices via keys that easily let you switch. But something you should know about this model is that it doesn’t ship with Logitech’s unifying USB receiver, and it won’t work with one you might already have. It’s a Bluetooth-only affair, though it is compatible with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Flogi-bolt-usb-receiver.956-000007.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22687565%2Flogitech-mx-keys-mini-wireless-keyboard-features-price-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s new $14.99 Bolt USB receiver&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651973/logitech-logi-bolt-usb-dongle-bluetooth-security-le-keyboard-mouse-accessories"&gt;lowers latency and adds more security&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xpZxS"&gt;The MX Keys Mini shares a number of other features in common with the MX Keys. Its concave, matte-textured keys offer a pretty great typing experience. It also has backlighting that kicks on automatically when your hands appear over the keyboard, turning off a few seconds after you pull away. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech MX Keys Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cmk7VDnWl3lKimDdC04qg9-77Rs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873081/mxkeysminicolors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Available in three colorways. The MX Keys Mini for Mac comes only in the leftmost grey and white option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RsHhnY"&gt;The default version of the MX Keys Mini shows both Windows and macOS commands, and it’s also compatible with Chrome OS, Linux, Android, iOS, and iPadOS. It comes in three colorways: rose, pale gray, and graphite. If you’re a dedicated Apple user who’d rather not have start and alt buttons, Logitech makes a version that’s just for macOS and other Apple products. It’s the same price, but it comes in just the pale grey colorway, which resembles Apple’s older desktop keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFe3cQ"&gt;Logitech claims that the MX Keys Mini can deliver up to 10 days of battery life with the backlighting turned on, as it is by default. Though, it can apparently last up to five months with the backlighting off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrzbZR"&gt;You certainly don’t need to spend $99.99 to get a decent wireless keyboard with scissor switches. But the price for the MX Keys Mini might be easier to justify if you use multiple devices at your setup, and especially if you use the MX Master or Anywhere mouse. When used alongside one of those, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/1/15715236/logitech-mx-master-2s-anywhere-mouse-flow-multiple-computer-support"&gt;Logitech’s Flow feature lets you move files between macOS and Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo confirms Donkey Kong area for Super Nintendo World</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHRAD0-F77hft53a0vF1sg4YBMA=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918843/snw.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WWLP5v"&gt;Nintendo has confirmed plans to expand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt;, its recently opened theme park at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, with a new Donkey Kong area. The news doesn’t exactly come as a surprise — construction already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605383/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-construction"&gt;appears to have been underway&lt;/a&gt; for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCxyF8"&gt;Imagery released by Nintendo confirms that, as speculated, the Donkey Kong zone will indeed be accessed through a large round door that already exists in the park, which is currently almost entirely Mario-themed. The zone will be a significant addition that increases Super Nintendo World’s overall size by about 70 percent, according to Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0aQPSk-j_qiw1-WHRnh5e0753Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884061/img_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A map showing the location of the new Donkey Kong area within Super Nintendo World.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="krXKGx"&gt;The Donkey Kong zone will include “a roller coaster, interactive experiences and themed merchandise and food,” Nintendo says in a &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210928.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Guests will be able to take a walk on the wild side through the lush jungles where Donkey Kong and his friends live.“ Nintendo goes on to describe the area as “a gamechanger that combines the innovative technology and globally popular approach to theme park entertainment of Universal with the creativity of Nintendo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Dx3JIu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Super Nintendo World is sensory overload","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Jm9G9V"&gt;“I am very happy to be able to make the world of Donkey Kong a reality following the world of Mario,” says Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto, who created the Donkey Kong and Mario characters. “I am looking forward to creating a thrilling Donkey Kong experience with the amazing team at Universal. It will take some time until it is completed, but it will be a unique area for not only people who are familiar with Donkey Kong games, but for all guests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvO60i"&gt;The new area is planned to open in 2024, at which point hopefully it’ll be actually possible to travel to Japan. Nintendo-themed areas are also in the works for the Orlando, Hollywood, and Singapore Universal Studios parks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump pushing Microsoft to buy TikTok was ‘strangest thing I’ve ever worked on,’ says Satya Nadella</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spA-QRAWrOpenYvKmDnYyZ76A5M=/0x0:4176x2784/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69918452/REC_ASA2_CODE21_20210927_182752_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella | Asa Mathat / Recode&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OA1OkF"&gt;It’s difficult to remember now, but in August 2020 there was a deeply surreal episode wherein &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21352004/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-trump-bytedance"&gt;Microsoft proposed acquiring some portion of TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354255/microsoft-tiktok-trump-ban-bytedance-china-us-canada"&gt;complicated deal&lt;/a&gt; as the Trump administration was threatening to come down hard on the platform. Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;TikTok turned Microsoft down&lt;/a&gt; just a day before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436035/tiktok-oracle-deal-bytedance-president-trump-safety"&gt;Oracle came in with an entirely different kind of deal&lt;/a&gt; and the whole thing dissipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6ckkA"&gt;Speaking today at &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;the Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the whole ordeal was the “strangest thing I’ve ever sort of worked on.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt9hI3"&gt;In terms of the value of such a deal for Microsoft, Nadella said he “was kind of intrigued by it,” before trying to move right along with a laugh, deadpanning after a pause “and then I guess the rest is history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24Gxlo"&gt;Kara Swisher pressed him for the story and Nadella, clearly still a little agog at the strangeness, walked through a few of the key steps. The important start is that “TikTok came to us, we didn’t come to TikTok,” he says. The company was looking for a US partner to help with “these security things we seem to [have been] hearing about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWygDQ"&gt;Nadella thought TikTok might have been a good fit because it was a social, cloud-based service that heavily leveraged AI, all areas of focus for the company. “It is an interesting product,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kBm2Ed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At this point I’m happy with what I have.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkGDsq"&gt;Nadella’s contention is that Microsoft would have been an interesting partner for TikTok because of its established work with “investments in social media, in particular what we’re doing in content moderation and child safety.” Those strengths — plus the key fact that it is a US-based cloud services provider — were seen to be key to assuaging the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N13v5w"&gt;“There was a period of time when I though the the [US government] had a particular set of requirements, [but] it just disappeared,” Nadella says. “President Trump I think had a particular point of view of what he was trying to get done ...and then just dropped off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdT3pT"&gt;TikTok ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21360130/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-bid-rejection-bytedance"&gt;let Microsoft know&lt;/a&gt; that it wouldn’t be moving forward with the deal in September. Later in the year, days ahead of a deadline Trump set for parent company ByteDance to sell off its US assets, TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559677/tiktok-cfius-court-petition-ban-deadline"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the administration had forgotten about the ban altogether. President Biden ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the order this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEcr9B"&gt;“At this point, it’s all moot, right?” Nadella says. He says he hasn’t followed up on what’s going on with TikTok and Oracle. (Hint: it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;shelved indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;.) Would he like to buy TikTok now if it came back on the table? “No,” Nadella says, “at this point I’m happy with what I have.”&lt;/p&gt;
