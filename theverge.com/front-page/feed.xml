    <title>The next Oculus Quest 2 update brings native wireless PC streaming and a 120Hz mode</title>

  &lt;p id="nEXegS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fintroducing-oculus-air-link-a-wireless-way-to-play-pc-vr-games-on-oculus-quest-2-plus-infinite-office-updates-support-for-120-hz-on-quest-2-and-more%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that wireless PC streaming, a 120Hz refresh rate, and improvements to Infinite Office will be coming to the Oculus Quest 2 with the v28 software update, which the company says will be rolling out soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYFi3f"&gt;Infinite Office is a feature that Oculus includes as part of Oculus Home, which lets users work in a virtual environment. With the v28 update, Infinite Office will have an experimental feature that allows users to add a virtual desk where their real-life desk is, letting users know where they can sit and put real-life physical objects down without having to leave VR. The Quest 2 will also be able to show a virtual representation of the Logitech K830 keyboard, though Facebook says that support for visualizing more keyboard models will be coming in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4zs3e"&gt;Another feature coming with the update is the ability to stream games or applications from your desktop PC wirelessly. Oculus calls its wireless streaming feature Air Link, named after the Link cable that can be used to connect the headset to a PC. The feature will only work well with some network setups — the instructions to turn it on are pretty clear that you’ll need good Wi-Fi to get an acceptable experience, and that the Link cable will still provide the best visual quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LlEM1"&gt;Facebook says that it hasn’t ruled out the possibility of bringing Air Link to the original Quest at some point in the future, but it does say that it’s “focused on optimizing Air Link to be the best possible experience for Quest 2 first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zfbBCd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0hDalX"&gt;We do know that the original Quest hardware is capable of wireless PC streaming, because indie developer Guy Godin has built it into his app, Virtual Desktop. The app gives users a virtual space to use their computers in, and it also supports streaming games over Wi-Fi. This is, however, where we have to talk about the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAyS5e"&gt;If you thought the description of Virtual Desktop sounded a little like Facebook’s Infinite Office, you’re not alone — Godin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;has been talking about&lt;/a&gt; how Facebook has been essentially building his app idea into its own Oculus experience then offering it for free for a while now. His case may have been helped by the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301151/oculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2"&gt;Facebook blocked the update that allowed Virtual Desktop to be used wirelessly&lt;/a&gt; until early this year, requiring users to go through a complicated sideload procedure to get the functionality working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwGvg0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-air-link-120/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; talked to Godin&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook introducing Air Link, and got this comment from him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZxUTGH"&gt;“In 2017, Facebook copied the base functionality of Virtual Desktop on Rift and incorporated it in their platform, essentially making my app obsolete. I’m not surprised to see them do this again on Quest. They copied the fitness tracking app YUR last year and released Oculus Move; essentially killing the company. They also released App Lab as they saw how popular SideQuest was. That’s what they do. If you have a popular app on Quest today, expect Facebook to copy you and leave you in the dust. As for the fate of Virtual Desktop on Quest, we will have to see how Facebook’s solution competes. Judging by the number of issues plaguing Oculus Link today, I’m confident Virtual Desktop will remain a valuable solution for a while. I’ve also got a lot of cool features in the works that I can’t wait to share with the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KDku86"&gt;Despite the warnings about Facebook copying ideas, he still seems confident in his ability to compete. It’s an open question as to how well Air Link will work initially, and how fast improvements will come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVu8K1"&gt;The update also includes an experimental mode for 120Hz refresh rates, up from the current 90Hz, and the original 72Hz. It’s a slight delay from Oculus’ &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/facebook-hints-oculus-quest-2-120hz-refresh-rate/"&gt;original estimated March launch&lt;/a&gt;. Oculus’ post hints that you many not immediately get to try it out — the Quest 2’s software will still run at 90Hz, so you won’t get to see what it looks like until developers release builds of their games and software that can run at the higher refresh rate. The wait may not be that long, though: Guy Godin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VRDesktop/status/1382116851551899648?s=20"&gt;has already tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he’s got a 120Hz update for Virtual Desktop ready to go when v28 becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nqI4YB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yep, the 120hz update is ready to roll out whenever the Quest 2 update lands&lt;/p&gt;— Guy Godin (@VRDesktop) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VRDesktop/status/1382116851551899648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>The FBI is remotely hacking hundreds of computers to protect them from Hafnium </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIktYOLmX1uIXO67xe4vKkX453o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69122269/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GW6zzM"&gt;In what’s believed to be an unprecedented move, the FBI is trying to protect hundreds of computers infected by the Hafnium hack &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hacking them itself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using the original hackers’ own tools (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/fbi-launches-operation-to-remotely-remove-microsoft-exchange-server-backdoors/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZA6V3"&gt;The hack, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;which affected tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange Server customers around the world and triggered a “whole of government response” from the White House&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly left a number of backdoors that could let any number of hackers right into those systems again. Now, the FBI has taken advantage of this by using those same web shells / backdoors to remotely delete themselves, an operation that the agency is calling a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oshaQ"&gt;“The FBI conducted the removal by issuing a command through the web shell to the server, which was designed to cause the server to delete only the web shell (identified by its unique file path),” explains &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft"&gt;the US Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTMTaB"&gt;The wild part here is that owners of these Microsoft Exchange Servers likely aren’t yet aware of the FBI’s involvement; the Justice Department says it’s merely “attempting to provide notice” to owners that they attempted to assist. It’s doing all this with the full approval of a Texas court, according to the agency. You can read the unsealed search and seizure warrant and application &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1386631/download"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLKPWv"&gt;It’ll be interesting to see if this sets a precedent for future responses to major hacks like Hafnium. While I’m personally undecided, it’s easy to argue that the FBI is doing the world a service by removing a threat like this — while Microsoft may have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;painfully slow with its initial response&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft Exchange Server customers have also now had well over a month to patch their own servers after several critical alerts. I wonder how many customers will be angry, and how many grateful that the FBI, not some other hacker, took advantage of the open door. We know that critical-but-local government infrastructure often has egregious security practices, most recently resulting in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368476/kansas-man-tamper-water-supply-remote-ellsworth-wyatt-travnichek"&gt;two local drinking water supplies being tampered with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGbdsw"&gt;The FBI says that thousands of systems were patched by their owners before it began its remote Hafnium backdoor removal operation, and that it only removed “removed one early hacking group’s remaining web shells which could have been used to maintain and escalate persistent, unauthorized access to U.S. networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6ZFiG"&gt;“Today’s court-authorized removal of the malicious web shells demonstrates the Department’s commitment to disrupt hacking activity using all of our legal tools, not just prosecutions,” reads a statement from Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers, with the Justice Department’s National Security Division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTfpz7"&gt;Today is Patch Tuesday, by the way, and Microsoft’s April 2021 security update includes new mitigations for Exchange Server vulnerabilities, &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/04/13/apply-microsoft-april-2021-security-update-mitigate-newly"&gt;according to CISA&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re running a local Exchange Server or know someone who is, take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US carriers have thankfully abandoned at least one bad plan for RCS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qR0YepDCoxN1VkapUXCRiSdAW6o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69122020/VRG_ILLO_2411_Google_Messaging_3.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span data-author="-1"&gt;GIF by Garret Beard and William Joel / The Verge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppkPbJ"&gt;According to the telecom industry news site &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/verizon-atandt-t-mobile-blow-rcs-launch/d/d-id/768729"&gt;Light Reading, the big three US carriers are walking away from&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The CCMI was meant to be a joint effort to promote RCS, the next-generation messaging standard designed to replace SMS. But while that might seem like bad news on the face of it, what it actually means is that carriers have given up on a bad plan that would have been bad for consumers. Whether or not they will replace it with a &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;plan remains, as ever with RCS, to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUOqAt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931202/us-carriers-rcs-cross-carrier-messaging-initiative-ccmi-att-tmobile-sprint-verizon"&gt;CCMI was launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and by all indications was a joint effort that was spearheaded by Sprint. It initially seemed like a mixed bag of news. At the time, any effort by carriers to support proper cross-compatibility in RCS was a good sign. But the bad part was the consortium planned on creating an Android app themselves for messaging features. If you’ve ever used an app designed by a major US carrier, you know that’s a recipe for a bad experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaoIQK"&gt;Google was not part of the CCMI announcement, either, which was very strange given that Google is by far the biggest booster for the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTsU3N"&gt;However, after that announcement there was precious little information or movement. All the carriers seemed too busy hyping up 5G to give any real attention to the CCMI. Plus, T-Mobile was barreling down the path towards acquiring Sprint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gq804x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CCMI promised a custom Android app from the carriers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPxnpm"&gt;That acquisition happened and the one carrier that seemed enthusiastic for CCMI was subsumed into another. Then, last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;T-Mobile announced a huge deal with Google&lt;/a&gt; that included switching Android phones over to Android Messages as the default RCS/SMS app. The writing was on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plPW8g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt; reached out to the third-party vendor, Synchronoss&lt;/a&gt;, that was originally going to handle the back-end logistics for the CCMI app (RCS can be run through a carrier’s server, Google’s server, or a third-party server). But while Synchronoss’ comment was noncommittal, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are now just telling it like it is. Here’s what Verizon told &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KQ9F9S"&gt;The owners of the Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative decided to end the joint venture effort. However, the owners remain committed to enhancing the messaging experience for customers including growing the availability of RCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4xjEne"&gt;Reached for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T gave us a nearly identical statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9Kyk1"&gt;The rollout for RCS worldwide — and especially in the US — has been terribly slow and even more terribly confusing. Phones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563641/pixel-3a-t-mobile-rcs-chat-rollout-broken-encryption"&gt;should be compatible weren’t&lt;/a&gt;, carriers that promised their RCS would interoperate with others didn’t build those systems, and Apple continued to stay absolutely silent on whether it would support RCS (and it continues to stay silent to this day). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIanVz"&gt;However, Google has plodded along with its plan, making piece-by-piece efforts to broaden RCS adoption. It made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964477/googles-rcs-chat-android-rollout-us-ccmi-texting-sms"&gt;RCS available to anybody on any carrier if they used Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; as their SMS app. It cut that deal with T-Mobile. It has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;begun testing end-to-end-encryption over RCS inside Android messages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBubJg"&gt;I will be the first in line to tell you that the rollout for RCS took what should have been a coordinated six-month effort that was a win for both carriers and Google and turned it into a multi-year slog that didn’t help anybody, least of all consumers. But the end of the CCMI is a sign that carriers might just be implementing more consumer-friendly RCS policies, not that they’re walking away entirely. T-Mobile made that deal with Google instead. Will all AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon continue to drag their feet on RCS? Almost definitely. But at least they won’t be foisting a carrier-made app on every Android user in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung teases ‘the most powerful’ Galaxy device is coming at its April 28th Unpacked event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Xi2NDMyTHa6d-YSXcdQ7iR5abo=/247x0:2854x1738/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69121986/Screen_Shot_2021_04_13_at_4.36.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MPRK9S"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vXN2MOi0s"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Galaxy Unpacked event set for April 28th at 10AM ET, teasing the announcement of “the most powerful Galaxy” device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWnPZr"&gt;The teaser, as is typical for these invitations, isn’t too forthcoming. But given the nature of the announcement and Samsung’s usual release cycle, there are a few hints we can suss out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbGnAT"&gt;First, the description of whatever Samsung is announcing as “the most powerful Galaxy” would seem to rule out a phone, like the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3. The most generous depiction of a mobile processor — even one as powerful as Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 888 — still isn’t in the same ballpark as a true laptop processor. And despite recent headlines, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-launch-date-1216922/"&gt;Samsung is still rumored&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the Z Fold 3 at a July event, potentially a replacement for the Galaxy Note’s high-end summer phone release spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAjmCt"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book lineup of laptops, on the other hand, would fit the bill for a more powerful Galaxy device — and is long overdue for an update. The current models were announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/29/20938145/samsung-galaxy-book-flex-ion-laptops-design-wireless-charging-qled-hands-on"&gt;all the way back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; (although they didn’t hit US stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246560/samsung-qled-galaxy-book-flex-alpha-ion-available-now"&gt;until May of last year&lt;/a&gt;), and they still feature Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;long-outdated&lt;/a&gt; 10th Gen processors. A Galaxy Book refresh that featured some of Intel’s new 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips — or even Intel’s newer 35W H-series variants — would easily take the crown as the new “most powerful” Galaxy product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UI9VkG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New Samsung laptops rumored to include OLED screens and S Pen support","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285268/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-oled-screen-s-pen-support-windows-intel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rMvYMo"&gt;Oh, and Samsung is already rumored to be working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285268/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-oled-screen-s-pen-support-windows-intel"&gt;new Galaxy Book Pro line of laptops&lt;/a&gt;, which would feature 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch OLED panels, S-Pen support, and upgraded Intel CPUs. One of the new models — the Galaxy Book Pro 360 — is also said to include 5G compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzDABZ"&gt;Lastly, if you wanted to get really creative, the glowing wedge of light seen in the invitation &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; sort of resemble an opened laptop (if you’re willing to squint a bit). We’ll find out for sure on April 28th, though — assuming one of Samsung’s characteristic leaks doesn’t arrive first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CX81Os"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="lO3tqz"&gt;A man who was falsely accused of shoplifting has &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/michigan-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty-facial"&gt;sued the Detroit Police Department&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"&gt;arresting him&lt;/a&gt; based on an incorrect facial recognition match. The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of Robert Williams, whom it calls the first US person wrongfully arrested based on facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMBe1c"&gt;The Detroit Police Department arrested Williams in 2019 after examining security footage from a shoplifting incident. A detective used facial recognition technology on a grainy image from the video, and the system flagged Williams as a potential match based on a driver’s license photo. But as &lt;a href="https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/farmington-hills-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty"&gt;the lawsuit notes&lt;/a&gt;, facial recognition is frequently inaccurate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;particularly with Black subjects&lt;/a&gt; and a low-quality picture. The department then produced a photo lineup that included Williams’ picture, showed it to a security guard who hadn’t actually witnessed the shoplifting incident, and obtained a warrant when that guard picked him from the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xP1S7G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At least three Black men have faced arrest after a bad match&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dUbB9I"&gt;Williams — who had been driving home from work during the incident — spent 30 hours in a detention center. The ACLU later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301759/facial-recognition-detroit-police-wrongful-arrest-robert-williams-artificial-intelligence"&gt;filed a formal complaint&lt;/a&gt; on his behalf, and the prosecutor’s office apologized, saying he could have the case expunged from his records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvvWFo"&gt;The ACLU claims Detroit police used facial recognition under circumstances that they should have known would produce unreliable results, then dishonestly failed to mention the system’s shortcomings — including a “woefully substandard” image and the known racial bias of recognition systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SHhzk"&gt;The department itself has acknowledged that Williams’ arrest was based on “sloppy investigative work” and other mistakes. But the complaint calls this incident part of a pattern, pointing to a second wrongful arrest involving a Black man misidentified by facial recognition tech. That man, Michael Oliver, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bv8k8a/faulty-facial-recognition-led-to-his-arrestnow-hes-suing"&gt;sued the department&lt;/a&gt; last year. Outside Detroit, at least &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html"&gt;one other Black man&lt;/a&gt; has sued for a wrongful arrest based on facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya8as0"&gt;Thousands of law enforcement agencies have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402978/clearview-ai-ceo-interview-2400-police-agencies-facial-recognition"&gt;allegedly used&lt;/a&gt; facial recognition tech to identify suspects. But a backlash has led several cities to ban the practice, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288053/microsoft-facial-recognition-police-law-enforcement-pledge-regulation"&gt;Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon have pledged&lt;/a&gt; to keep their systems out of police hands.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gigabyte is announcing three gaming monitors with HDMI 2.1 and TV sizes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYlkbRoBSfYHMDCnUQH950AdxJs=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69121351/AORUS_4K_Gaming_Monitors_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFyVGn"&gt;Gigabyte has announced three new 4K gaming monitors for its Aorus brand, each features HDMI 2.1, the somewhat hard-to-find display connector that allows for high refresh rate gaming at 4K  (&lt;a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/78707/aorus-fo48u-48-inch-4k-120hz-oled-gaming-monitor-with-hdmi-2-1-tech/index.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TweakTown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Besides having some of the best tech available in TVs or monitors, all three have desk-dominating sizes. According to &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/press-release/aorus-announces-32-43-and-48-inch-4k-gaming-monitors-with-hdmi-2-1"&gt;a press release posted by &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the monitors will also feature VESA’s HDR 1000 standard and come in three sizes: 32, 43, and a mind-boggling (for a gaming monitor anyway; we’ll get back to that) 48 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLJEa0"&gt;The 48-inch version is a little different, and it set off a firestorm of discussion at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so let’s set it aside for just one moment. The 32- and 43-inch monitors, named the FI32U and the FV43U, respectively, will feature 144Hz panels. Gigabyte is also claiming that FI32U will have a 0.5ms response time, which looks to make it one of the faster 4K gaming monitors out there. While the FV43U has a slower 1ms response time, that’s probably something even the most eagle-eyed and competitive gamers would have issues noticing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z24FGI"&gt;The 48-inch model, dubbed the FO48U, is slightly different from the other two. Besides dropping the refresh rate from 144Hz to 120Hz, it’s also the size of a TV more at home in an entertainment center — specifically, the 48-inch model of LG’s CX OLED TVs, which shares many of the same specs as Gigabyte’s version, from the HDMI 2.1 inputs to the 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a6iIbN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Gigabyte &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;going for a TV experience, what is it offering that LG doesn’t already have?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n3WiY5"&gt;So what’s going on here? Gigabyte is likely using the same OLED panels as LG. That makes it kind of hard to figure out why anyone would want to go with it over LG’s TV (especially since you could go out and buy LG’s version right now). And despite calling it a “monitor,” it doesn’t seem like Gigabyte expects many people to use this on a desk; its website specifically says it’s for “your gaming space or living room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dzcao"&gt;However, LG’s 48-inch TV has had great success in the last year as a monitor for people who apparently want to sit very close to the action. There’s no doubt it’d be immersive... at least, until you had to crane your neck to see the minimap or other HUD elements. But if Gigabyte &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;going for a TV experience, what is it offering that LG doesn’t already have? G-Sync and FreeSync? LG’s got it. Cheaper price due to potentially less processing power and smart features? Gigabyte hasn’t announced pricing, but we’re skeptical that it’ll end up being cheaper. (The LG retails for $1,500.) Gaming (er, sorry, “tactical”) features, such as “black equalizer,” which supposedly makes enemies easier to see? Okay, fair point. LG’s TV is intended for watching movies and playing games, while Gigabyte appears to be adding a few more gamer-focused features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SZBQ2"&gt;This isn’t to say there’s no reason for it to exist. Some people might prefer its aesthetic over LG’s (maybe it’ll even have RGB to really sell it). Or maybe Gigabyte will surprise us, and it’ll be cheaper. Until we know pricing, it’s hard to judge. Still, it seems like if it stands out, it won’t be for its uniqueness — which is a shame, really, given how the other models seem to be offering a set of features that is hard to find elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hs0Hb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The initial version of the article stated that all the monitors used OLED panels. It seems like only one, the FO48U, is OLED. It’s unclear what technology the smaller two use and we’ve reached out to Gigabyte to confirm. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CS:GO has a years-old bug that can let a hacker take over your computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EO_RV8qkswTZdQkNeWiA-42DHOU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69121208/acastro_300505_4008_pcGameHacks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auo56r"&gt;Hackers have found a new exploit in &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt; that could allow a hacker to take control of your computer if you click on a Steam invite to play the popular first-person shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nC1hh"&gt;The bug was discovered by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/the_secret_club"&gt;The Secret Club&lt;/a&gt;, a white hat hacking group, which found that the hackers can exploit the bug by using Steam’s invite system. Should a victim click on the link, a hacker could acquire private information from anyone who accepts it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeIbiD"&gt;The exploit was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNQn%E2%80%949xR1Q"&gt;discovered in the Source game engine&lt;/a&gt;, which Valve developed and is used in several game Valve titles, including &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;. While some games that use the engine no longer have the bug, the exploit is still present in &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive &lt;/em&gt;as seen in the video below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MMQt0R"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNQn--9xR1Q?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfaO4C"&gt;According to The Secret Club, one of its members and security researcher named &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floesen_"&gt;Florian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/the_secret_club/status/1380868759129296900?s=20"&gt;flagged the bug to Valve in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Florian &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyvgej/counter-strike-bug-allows-hackers-to-take-over-a-pc-with-a-steam-invite"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he reached out to Valve about the bug via HackerOne, a bug bounty platform that the studio uses. Despite Valve classifying the bug as “critical,” Florian told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that the studio admitted it was “slow to respond” in threads regarding the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y68XX5"&gt;The revelation about this bug is concerning for &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive &lt;/em&gt;players. Although the game is almost 10 years old, it is still &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/stats/Steam-Game-and-Player-Statistics?l=t/"&gt;very popular on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129666/counter-strike-go-danger-zone-battle-royale-mode-free-to-play-expansion"&gt;switched to a free-to-play model&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238268/league-of-legends-csgo-esports-leagues-twitch-viewership"&gt;world’s biggest esports leagues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker is making a $130 webcam as part of its new expansion to home office gear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGQSIcCKm6tyCpMGxn-5fJxXhhg=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69120466/PowerConf_C300___02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEuXaG"&gt;Anker has &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/anker-launches-smart-ai-enabled-webcam-and-portable-noise-isolating-conference-speaker-301267988.html"&gt;announced a new webcam&lt;/a&gt; as part of its new AnkerWork line of home office gear. The new webcam, called the PowerConf C300, is a 1080p webcam with a “built-in AI chipset,” which Anker says “provides a high-quality image with accurate color reproduction and unparalleled low-light performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5LL1z"&gt;The webcam offers three field-of-view options: 78 degrees, intended for closeups; 90 degrees; and 115 degrees, which offers a wider field of view. It also has dual stereo microphones that can pick up your voice. The PowerConf C300 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-AI-Powered-Noise-Cancelling-Microphones-Adjustable/dp/B08RNHCZ3K/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=anker+powerconf+c300&amp;amp;qid=1618338789&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FAnker.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22382179%2Fanker-webcam-ankerwork-powerconf-c300-s500-home-office-gear" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker.com&lt;/a&gt;, and “select retailers,” and it costs $129.99 in the US, €129.99 in Germany, and £119.00 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y7GMIj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV1HDVFQQiw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afheyx"&gt;Anker also announced a new portable conference speaker, the PowerConf S500. Pricing and availability will be announced at a later date, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcSTTx"&gt;The news of Anker’s new webcam and speaker comes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22381422/microsoft-new-webcam-headsets-usb-c-speaker-features-price-specs-release-date"&gt;the same day that Microsoft &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; announced&lt;/a&gt; a speaker designed for conference calls and a webcam of its own. Webcams have been in high demand during the pandemic as people have used them while working from home, attending remote school, or even just to catch up with friends and family, and Microsoft and Anker’s new offerings give people more options to choose from. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobvoi’s TicWatch GTH has an Apple Watch look and a skin temperature sensor for $79.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bLwjUYMBfW6GpP7jy4K9jR67ocA=/0x557:3840x3117/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69120420/TicWatch_GTH_Right_facing.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mobvoi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVJFt8"&gt;Mobvoi is starting to sell the TicWatch GTH today, a $79.99 fitness wearable that features sensors for skin temperature and blood oxygen that are typically reserved for more expensive watches. Mobvoi has generally focused on Wear OS devices in the past, providing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;a variety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18217223/mobvoi-ticwatch-e2-s2-review-price-size-battery-release-date-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;of options&lt;/a&gt; for Google’s troubled wearable operating system, but the TicWatch GTH seems more like a Fitbit competitor than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMbsP4"&gt;The TicWatch GTH has an Apple Watch-esque square body, a noticeably bezeled 1.55-inch screen, and only comes in “raven black.” Mobvoi claims the GTH’s 260mAh battery can last more than a week on one charge, “depending on usage,” and that the watch is also water-resistant up to 5ATM or 50 meters. Despite that, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobvoi.com%2Fus%2Fpages%2Fticwatchgth&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381867%2Fmobvoi-ticwatch-gth-smartwatch-skin-temperature-blood-oxygen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mobvoi’s website&lt;/a&gt; notes that the GTH is not safe for shower use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ArT_8aBJiqEEKU7ybEz4hDEp1SA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441461/TicWatch_GTH_Back.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mobvoi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TicWatch GTH has several sensors that appear on more expensive watches, like an SpO2 sensors and an electrodermal activity sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3l7QpG"&gt;For sensors, the GTH has the usual fitness tracker standbys like an accelerometer, gyroscope, and a heart rate monitor, but also a SpO2 sensor for measuring blood oxygen level and a skin temperature sensor for... well, measuring your skin temperature. Actual uses for skin temperature data vary, however. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;The Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt; advertised skin temperature sensing as an indicator for stress. In its announcement for the GTH, Mobvoi didn’t specify what skin temperature should be used for. But as a rule, we urge caution for any big claims a new sensor might come attached with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuES45"&gt;That rule also applies to measuring blood oxygen saturation. There’s been a trend of including blood oxygen sensors in smartwatches, but the wrist is not actually the best place to measure saturation, and these smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438576/blood-oxygen-apple-watch-series-6-reliability"&gt;shouldn’t be thought of as medical devices&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing your blood oxygen level mostly seems useful for serious athletic training and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAn7IP"&gt;But even if they might not necessarily be useful, the fact that the TicWatch includes both SpO2 and skin temperature sensors for only $79.99 is notable. The GTH undercuts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;the Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; at $399, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;the Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt; at $299.95, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;the Fitbit Charge 4&lt;/a&gt; at $169.95, while tracking a lot of the same things. The TicWatch GTH is stuck in Mobvoi’s Tic-based app world, but the company does offer a variety of features like stress management, sleep tracking, automatic workout detection, audio playback controls, and basic messaging notifications if you’re willing to invest in a potentially unfamiliar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhzyDA"&gt;The TicWatch GTH is not particularly flashy, but its price might be enticing if you’re looking for an even more affordable entry into tracking than Fitbit’s entry-level watches. The TicWatch GTH is available today for $79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99 from Mobvoi’s site or Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lIChp"&gt;Pinterest has been battered with accusations of workplace discrimination for many months, and we’ve followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;a large portion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369035/pinterest-virtual-walkout-protest-discrimination-slack-blind"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755406/pinterest-shareholders-lawsuit-sue-toxic-work-culture-discrimination"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;saga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178609/pinterest-wilmer-hale-workplace-culture-report-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;That includes,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;most recently, how Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee who accused the company of trying to silence her, helped draft California’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272779/silenced-no-more-act-california-nda-employees-workplace-harassment"&gt;new Silenced No More Act&lt;/a&gt;. Today, Ozoma is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/opinion/nda-work-discrimination.html"&gt;speaking out in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about why she believes nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) should not be allowed to keep whistleblowers in check — but Pinterest now says, effective immediately, it will stop making workers sign NDAs that prevent them from talking about such things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjuF08"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/pinterest-silenced-no-more-act"&gt;That’s the news from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Pinterest will “not require employees to sign agreements that would prevent them from talking about their personal experiences at Pinterest after they leave,” according to the company’s global head of communications. It sounds like NDAs for other forms of company secrets will continue on, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bz82Ue"&gt;Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann also reportedly issued a staff memo this morning about the Silenced No More Act, where he came out in support of the bill. “Regardless of what happens in the legislature, whether the bill moves forward or not, we’re going to adopt the policies behind the proposed law,” he reportedly wrote, according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol. &lt;/em&gt;Silbermann was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755406/pinterest-shareholders-lawsuit-sue-toxic-work-culture-discrimination"&gt;one of the executives sued in December&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly creating a toxic work environment.&lt;/p&gt;
