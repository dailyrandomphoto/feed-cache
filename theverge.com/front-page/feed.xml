    <title>Jack Dorsey’s Square, Inc is buying a majority stake in Jay Z’s streaming service Tidal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zy2bKC"&gt;Square, Inc, the financial services company founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpress%2Ftidal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313108%2Fsquare-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acquiring a majority stake&lt;/a&gt; in Tidal, the high-fidelity audio and video streaming service led by Jay Z. Square is paying $297 million in cash and stock for a “significant majority ownership stake,” with Tidal operating independently alongside Square’s other ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXO1E9"&gt;Asking the obvious question in a thread on Twitter, Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460907958243328"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!” His answer: to find “new ways for artists to support their work.” Just as Square gave sellers now tools to make money, Dorsey says the company’s stake in Tidal will help artists find similar support in the new digital economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne0Ox6"&gt;“Given what Square has been able to do for sellers of all sizes and individuals through Cash App, we believe we can now work for artists to see the same success for them, and us,” tweeted Dorsey. “We’re going to start small and focus on the most critical needs of artists and growing their fanbases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJnJFO"&gt;“Square created ecosystems of tools for sellers &amp;amp; individuals, and we’ll do the same for artists. We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBVK2F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators call on FCC to quadruple base high-speed internet speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Janet Yellen Confirmation Hearing For Treasury Secretary Before Senate Finance Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxcU2F0IVLZoMntp4hEn5oqPCt0=/0x0:5374x3583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909919/1230675894.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A0XFv"&gt;The federal government’s definition of high-speed broadband has remained stagnant over the last six years, sitting at 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up since 2015. But faced with pandemic-fueled network loads and a new push for infrastructure spending, lawmakers are getting ready to upgrade that definition. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;In a letter to government leaders&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators called for a quadrupling of base high-speed broadband delivery speeds making 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up the new base for high-speed broadband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUMUQu"&gt;“Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality,”  Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Angus King (I-ME), and Rob Portman (R-OH) &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;wrote to the FCC&lt;/a&gt; and other agencies. “There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR7OeW"&gt;The letter calls on the FCC and other agencies to change their definitions of “high speed broadband” to anything above 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up — a shift that would prohibit the FCC from identifying an area as being served with broadband unless it met those speed criteria. It’s a complete change of pace from the FCC under former Chairman Ajit Pai’s leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;which established&lt;/a&gt; the previous 25 / 3Mbps standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv6jGE"&gt;“We find that the current speed benchmark of 25/3 Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability,” the FCC’s report said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXhF1C"&gt;The current base speeds for high-speed broadband aren’t nearly enough for a moderately sized family working from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;Zoom recommends&lt;/a&gt; 3.8Mbps upload speeds for just one 1080p video, and the shift to remote schooling and work has forced many families to run multiple simultaneous streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmEMFX"&gt;“Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, or any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to ‘high speed’ in the year 2021,” the senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyqIxM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 3/4/21 at 8:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated quotes to reflect final text of the letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s $260 Redmi Note 10 Pro has a 120Hz screen and a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jltKGHYnQkYNli9YcfnYVoHLGc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909890/DSCF7567.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gL9v7g"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its Redmi Note 10 line, the latest in its phone series that’s titanically popular in India and beyond. As is tradition for the Redmi Note phones, the 10 series brings some high-end features to much lower price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ShkYe"&gt;The Redmi Note 10 Pro is the main attraction here, with several variants including the Note 10S, Note 10, and Note 10 5G adjusting various specs to meet different price points. The Note 10 Pro’s standout feature is its 6.67-inch 1080p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVULZW"&gt;The Note 10 Pro also has a 108-megapixel primary camera alongside an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel “telemacro”, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. On paper, that puts its camera setup in reach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 flagship&lt;/a&gt;, though the Note 10 Pro’s 1.55-inch 108-megapixel sensor is a little smaller. The holepunch selfie camera, meanwhile, is 16 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Is_OcSDViqMD2ts3YzIE2xsXkd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344632/DSCF7564.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DxgQOC"&gt;Other specs include a Snapdragon 732 processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage, a 5,020mAh battery, 33W fast charging, a microSD card slot plus two separate SIM card slots, stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor in the power button, and a headphone jack. The biggest omission is wireless charging, but that’s not a surprise for a device in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPmWz8"&gt;Xiaomi wouldn’t provide full international pricing details ahead of the launch, but the Indian variant of the Redmi Note 10 Pro is called the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max and starts at Rs. 18,999 (~$260) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The non-Max Indian Note 10 Pro is identical but has a 64-megapixel main camera instead and starts at 15,999 (~$220) for the 6GB/64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Alexa app for Xbox brings visual assistant features to your TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FHeu6JZrp7AeYyOlHUA2oC6C5Y=/1x0:1618x1078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909765/alexaxbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s new Alexa app on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTQuJu"&gt;Amazon is launching a new Alexa app for Xbox consoles this week. While you’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826718/microsoft-xbox-one-alexa-features-support-voice-control"&gt;able to control Alexa from an Xbox&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of years now, this dedicated app will provide access to more of the visual parts of Amazon’s digital assistant. That includes being able to see your doorbell camera, reading emails and checking your calendar, and even seeing weather forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwarG"&gt;It essentially turns your Xbox into more of an Echo Show-like experience for Alexa. All of the usual Xbox controls are still supported with this new app, including the ability to turn on an Xbox console using a compatible Alexa device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfkFGs"&gt;Amazon is gradually rolling out this new Alexa app for Xbox in the coming days, and it will be available across all Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S consoles. You should be able to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Falexa-for-xbox%2F9ngdjk7chn45%3Fwa%3Dwsignin1.0%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download the Alexa app from the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; right now, but we’ve tried to get it to work with a couple of Xbox consoles and it doesn’t appear to be fully live just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALfnZX"&gt;Here are some of the new commands available with the visual version of Alexa on Xbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WhVbyh"&gt;Alexa, play &amp;lt;artist name&amp;gt; on Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8syrRC"&gt;Alexa, show me the front door camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hoGq73"&gt;Alexa, show me my email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PSdMLz"&gt;Alexa, show me my calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWoU3H"&gt;Alexa, show me the weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Skydio drones reportedly owned by more than 20 US police agencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cEhPeojzvt8pF63bnU10JGKZDnU=/57x0:1557x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909699/Skydio_X2_commercial_drone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skydio’s X2 drone, which is aimed at enterprise and military customers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Skydio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xyFTwa"&gt;More than 20 police agencies around the US own drones from US manufacturer Skydio, according to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/03/03/drones-with-most-advanced-ai-ever-coming-soon-to-your-local-police-department/?sh=619d88073f0b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which calculated the figure based on a combination of freedom of information requests and public announcements. The report follows news that Skydio is the first US dronemaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded"&gt;to be valued at over $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; following a recent funding round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aal5uj"&gt;Working with police departments is thought to be part of Skydio’s attempt to make inroads against dominant player DJI, which is &lt;a href="https://droneii.com/the-drone-manufacturer-ranking-2020"&gt;said to command&lt;/a&gt; between 70 and 80 percent of the commercial drone market. Skydio started offering its drones to government agencies for free last year, and over 30 public agencies reportedly took them up on the offer. America’s Custom and Border Protection is also testing using the company’s drones this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lgtcMP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Steering away from that just because it’s controversial or polarizing would be the wrong thing to do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqXNyS"&gt;Skydio’s prospects have been helped by the US government’s recent decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;add DJI to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List&lt;/a&gt;. Although DJI’s consumer business hasn’t seen a significant impact, with customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22190097/dji-blacklist-ban-xinjiang-entity-list-trump"&gt;still able to buy and use its drones&lt;/a&gt;, the move has reportedly caused some police departments to explore ditching its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcw1Nt"&gt;The selling point of Skydio’s drones is their self-flying technology, and &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; notes that police forces find this helpful for having the drones fly inside buildings or through forests. Last year, one of the company’s drones was used to help a SWAT team during a standoff with armed suspects in Burlington, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2RWs"&gt;Although Skydio’s CEO Adam Bry admits that working with government agencies may mean its drones are used in “potentially polarizing and charged situations,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes,&lt;/em&gt; “steering away from that just because it’s controversial or polarizing would be the wrong thing to do.” In comments &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/technology/anduril-military-palmer-luckey.html"&gt;given to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO has come out strongly against Skydio’s drones being used with weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slCPfx"&gt;“We are not putting weapons on the drone,” Bry said. “Weaponization is the one thing where you want less automation, not more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Windows 10 UI overhaul continues with new system icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORL0hmH3Mp9m216ciRqw0xvwwHM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909695/wjoel_200601_1777_windows10_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ds0o2Y"&gt;Microsoft is starting to modernize some of the basic parts of Windows 10 by improving the system icons that are available in the operating system. A &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/03/03/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21327/"&gt;new preview build&lt;/a&gt; of Windows 10 is rolling out to testers this week, and it includes system icons that now adhere to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15615812/microsoft-fluent-design-system-project-neon-features"&gt;Fluent Design style&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da8rAF"&gt;The new icons include a more rounded and simplified look, and are available as a new font — Segoe Fluent Icons. Microsoft has also updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217153/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature"&gt;new taskbar widget&lt;/a&gt; with the new icons, providing a good look at how basic icon changes can modernize even the smallest parts of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8rj1f1eC2qyCNxI0NWpYemsD8n8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344675/windows10systemicons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the new system icons for Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UybnYc"&gt;It’s a small change to Windows 10 that will appear later this year for most, but it’s part of a broader push by Microsoft to overhaul Windows 10. Microsoft updated some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; last year with colorful versions, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310597/microsoft-windows-10-start-menu-design-new-alt-tab-features"&gt;tweaked the Start menu&lt;/a&gt; to make it a little more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfH67u"&gt;Microsoft is also planning a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” codenamed Sun Valley. It might seem like Microsoft has been promising visual overhauls of Windows 10 for years with its Fluent Design push, but even bigger UI changes look set to appear later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrxUJe"&gt;The Windows Start menu, File Explorer, and built-in apps are all expected to be overhauled as part of this UI refresh. Even basic things like buttons, controls, and sliders in apps should get some design love. This should mean Windows will look a lot more consistent, and hopefully a lot of the ancient icons and Windows 95-era prompts start to disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8sBYIWNa8rWlyPt9CwJMaSz8_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344679/News_and_interests_redesign.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new system icons in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GtjpMN"&gt;Microsoft has put a lot of work into improving its UI consistency in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, an upcoming version of Windows that will be designed for Chromebook-like devices. Windows 10X includes a new Start menu, and lots of changes to basic controls like Wi-Fi, the notification center, and more. It feels like a stripped back, more simplified version of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxAIdI"&gt;How Microsoft markets Windows 10X could be a hint at where it sees Windows heading in the future. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1365150436366241797"&gt;Rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is gearing up to use “the new Windows” as a marketing term, and we’re expecting Microsoft to have a lot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;more Windows news soon&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is planning events in the coming weeks to detail its future plans for gaming, Windows, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hK01YD"&gt;While Microsoft held its Ignite conference this week, the company had very little to say about Windows. Microsoft’s head of Windows and devices, Panos Panay, acknowledged that news is on the way, though. “I haven’t talked about the next generation of Windows, and what’s coming next,” said Panay during an &lt;a href="https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/b3da6f4e-1f60-45fb-b58a-35a9dfe8f062?source=schedule"&gt;Ignite session&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. “I’m so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2015/10/6/9465373/microsoft-surface-panos-panay-pumped"&gt;pumped&lt;/a&gt;. The future of Windows is incredible, but we’re here today to talk about Windows 10.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWT5iU"&gt;It’s unusual to hear Microsoft talk about its “next generation of Windows,” particularly as the company has stuck to the Windows 10 branding since its debut nearly six years ago. I don’t think that means we’re about to see a Windows 11, but how Microsoft separates out Windows 10 and Windows 10X will be key to avoiding any confusion (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/13/4833408/surface-rt-naming-caused-some-confusion"&gt;Windows RT&lt;/a&gt;). That’s especially true if Windows 10X doesn’t support legacy desktop apps at launch, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132826/microsoft-windows-10x-features-dual-screen-foldable-hands-on-developers"&gt;our recent look at the OS suggests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Far-right news and misinformation received the most engagement on Facebook during 2020 US election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiGHox3opdRWfnRpKmG3eo6uVSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909648/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T3xet7"&gt;In the weeks before and after the 2020 US election, Facebook content from far-right sources of news and misinformation received more engagement than other sources elsewhere on the political spectrum, a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/far-right-news-sources-on-facebook-more-engaging-e04a01efae90"&gt;new study from New York University&lt;/a&gt; has revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKcxK2"&gt;The findings suggest that far-right pages have an advantage energizing followers on the world’s biggest social network. “My takeaway is that, one way or another, far-right misinformation sources are able to engage on Facebook with their audiences much, much more than any other category,” Laura Edelson, a researcher at NYU’s Cybersecurity for Democracy initiative who helped compile the report, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/03/tech/facebook-right-wing-misinformation/index.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s probably pretty dangerous on a system that uses engagement to determine what content to promote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KH661j"&gt;Researchers looked at some 8.6 million public posts shared by 2,973 “news and information sources” from August 10th, 2020 to January 11th, 2021, categorizing the political slant and verisimilitude of their output based on evaluations by independent outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/"&gt;NewsGuard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/"&gt;Media Bias/Fact Check&lt;/a&gt;. The study measured how often Facebook users engaged with this content — sharing, commenting, or responding with reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dAbjGAHnJnBw3KO2ILjC-bT4Pgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344664/1_6y92N6cQpZO9LbOKI2jZIw.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NYU Cybersecurity for Democracy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data from NYU’s study shows far-right sources of news and misinformation outperforming other parts of the political spectrum. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GTIXya"&gt;Their findings showed that far-right sources generated the highest average number of interactions per post, followed by far-left sources, then more centrist pages. Looking specifically at far-right sources, they found that pages spreading misinformation performed best. “Far-right sources designated as spreaders of misinformation had an average of 426 interactions per thousand followers per week, while non-misinformation sources had an average of 259 weekly interactions per thousand followers,” write the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QYqqXN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being a consistent spreader of far-right misinformation appears to confer a significant advantage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tyMv0z"&gt;Notably, the study showed that while spreading misinformation meant less engagement for sources on the far-left, left, center, and right wing of the political spectrum, it actually seemed to be an advantage for sources on the far-right. “Being a consistent spreader of far-right misinformation appears to confer a significant advantage,” said the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnEICQ"&gt;The study is yet more evidence against the claim made by conservative politicians that Facebook is biased against right-wing sources. It also casts doubts on the efficacy of Facebook’s efforts to limit the spread of misinformation in the run-up to the US 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvpZtc"&gt;The researchers behind the study note that their findings are limited, too. Although they were able to measure and compare engagement from different sources on Facebook, they couldn’t check how many people actually saw a piece of content or how long they spent reading it. Facebook simply doesn’t provide this data, leaving an incomplete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijE6Y9"&gt;“Such information would help researchers better analyze &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; far-right content is more engaging,” write the researchers. “Further research is needed to determine to what extent Facebook algorithms feed into this trend, for example, and to conduct analysis across other popular platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok. Without greater transparency and access to data, such research questions are out of reach.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HomeKit makes Ikea’s cheap buttons and motion sensors much more powerful</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Once you figure out the setup, at least&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bOqB9Q"&gt;Ikea’s new $9.99 / &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fnl%2Fnl%2Fp%2Ftradfri-snelkoppelknop-wit-40356381%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310841%2Fikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€7.99&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fp%2Ftradfri-shortcut-button-white-40467765%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310841%2Fikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;£6&lt;/a&gt; Trådfri Shortcut Buttons and existing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Ftradfri-wireless-motion-sensor-white-60377655%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310841%2Fikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$14.99&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fnl%2Fnl%2Fp%2Ftradfri-draadloze-bewegingssensor-wit-70429913%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310841%2Fikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€12.95&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fp%2Ftradfri-wireless-motion-sensor-white-70429913%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310841%2Fikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;£12&lt;/a&gt; Trådfri Motion Sensors recently gained HomeKit support to the delight of many Apple device owners. Importantly, the addition is cumulative for the most part, allowing the Ikea devices to function with the best features of Ikea Home Smart while layering on the best of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="IZMH4h"&gt;I’ve been testing both Ikea Home Smart devices for the past few days and while setup is predictably buggy, when they’re up and running it’s glorious, especially for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN3zbe"&gt;Motion sensors designed to work with HomeKit aren’t cheap. They range in price from $21 to $57 according to &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/best-homekit-motion-sensors"&gt;this roundup from &lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The popular Motion sensor from Philips Hue, for example, is more capable but costs $40, or almost three times as much as Ikea’s sensor, and both require hub devices to communicate with HomeKit. The Hue Bridge costs $59.99 while the Ikea Gateway costs $29.99, although these are often discounted in bundles with compatible lights and switches. An Apple home hub is also required, which can be a HomePod, Apple TV, or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce0z7b"&gt;There isn’t another product quite like Ikea’s Shortcut Buttons in the HomeKit world, so it’s hard to compare pricing. Some people will repurpose the four buttons on a $24.99 Hue dimmer switch to perform HomeKit automations, but it’s not really the same, and Aqara buttons are hard to find. Ikea designed its Shortcut Buttons to operate a single scene and that’s all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A8AAQT"&gt;Ikea Shortcut Button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="b8SOFL"&gt;The Ikea Shortcut Buttons are meant to be scattered around the home as dedicated controllers for individual or groups of devices. Place one next to the bed to shut off all the lights, for example, without having to yell at a smart assistant or launch an app. Place another in the kitchen to play your favorite Spotify playlist on the Sonos speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ckuHA"&gt;The magnetic buttons include a metal mounting bracket that can be screwed into a wall or attached with the double-sided tape found in the box for a less permanent option. They also ship with six stickers: three printed with icons representing nighttime, lights, and morning, and three blanks for you to illustrate yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea demonstrating a Shortcut Button starting a scene to The Verge in 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Huzdy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Operations can be assigned in both the Ikea and Apple apps with cumulative results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HbzcRn"&gt;The Shortcut Button can be assigned operations in both the Ikea Home Smart and Apple Home apps with cumulative results. It’s a bit confusing (and potentially conflicting), but combining the Ikea and Apple worlds makes the Shortcut Buttons much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUIbE4"&gt;I defined a “Good Night” Shortcut Button in the Apple Home app that I placed on a shelf above my bed. A regular press turns off seven smart lights (a mix of Ikea and Hue) and four Sonos speakers. A long press turns on a decorative filament night light in the bedroom at 10 percent brightness. To achieve these results, I had to assign a “scene” to the Shortcut Button in the Ikea Home Smart app and also assign “actions” in the Apple Home app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYYOfW"&gt;When using the Shortcut Buttons only with Ikea’s Home Smart app, you are limited to a single scene assigned to a single button press. But Ikea’s deeper Sonos integration exposes all of my Sonos speakers to the Shortcut Button, not just the newer AirPlay 2 speakers recognized by HomeKit. HomeKit improves upon Ikea Home Smart by detecting both a short press and a long press of the Shortcut Buttons. Apple also gives you the option of writing if / then / else shortcuts (confusing, I know) that can be assigned to the short and long presses instead, giving you four possible control options from a single Shortcut Button. (Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/luf1fv/use_a_toggle_shortcut_in_homekit_to_double_your/"&gt;useful thread explaining the steps started by u/armadawars&lt;/a&gt; on the HomeKit subreddit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sqSQQPqRTbXyATOLnr3u_Xaik-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342049/Good_night_ikea.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea Scene assignment for “Good Night” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SHVLTdPDQCdnFRhitMrXoavAvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342051/good_night_homekit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Action assignments for “Good Night” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mi7akv"&gt;So far, I’ve kept things simple. I have a scene called “Top music off” in the Home Smart app that I’ve assigned to the aforementioned “Good Night” Shortcut Button. This allows me to shut off any Sonos speakers that might be playing in, or around, my bedroom. In Apple’s Home app, I also assigned a mix of seven Philips Hue and Ikea lights to turn off with a single press of the “Good Night” Shortcut Button. I then assigned a long press to turn on the Ikea filament bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUFhEi"&gt;I have a second Shortcut Button in my living room currently set up to control my TV and mood lighting in the Apple Home app. A short press turns on my 2020 LG OLED TV and two lights to a predefined color and brightness. A long press turns everything back off. And just because I can, I also assigned a scene to the button in the Ikea Home Smart app that starts playing a Christmas playlist on the kitchen Sonos anytime it’s pressed. It’s dumb, and my family hates it, but it makes me so damn happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PNfZwf"&gt;Ikea Motion Sensor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mhCRnP"&gt;I would have driven myself mad setting up the Ikea Trådfri Motion Sensor in HomeKit had I not first read &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tradfri/comments/lqgf3a/using_tradfri_motion_sensors_with_homekit/"&gt;this tip on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umnuLU"&gt;Despite my Trådfri Gateway being upgraded to firmware 1.13.21 and seeing both of my existing motion sensors in the Apple Home app &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the sensors tripping Ikea lights when motion was detected, neither was detecting motion according to HomeKit. To solve that, first I had to remove the motion sensor from the Gateway (four clicks on the pairing button), delete the old rooms hosting the sensors from the Ikea Home Smart app, and then re-add the sensor (two clicks holding it next to the Gateway) where it was assigned a new default room. Only then did I see motion activity detected in Apple’s Home app, allowing me to control HomeKit devices with the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUltc3XgGcIj3Z6QznKNdla6ItE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342178/IMG_BDEF43E41AF5_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pantry sensor paired to Ikea lightbulb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7rXzu-z_VyCj7YCj7qpowcWBa2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342141/IMG_6300.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pantry light and sensor in Apple Home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6fNOB"&gt;As with the Shortcut Buttons, automations linked to the Ikea Motion Sensor in both the Ikea and Apple Home apps are cumulative. In my walk-in pantry, I paired an Ikea lightbulb directly to an Ikea Motion Sensor (press the link button on the Motion Sensor while holding it next to the Ikea bulb for about 10 seconds) and then set up an automation in the Apple Home app to turn on a strip of Hue lights above my kitchen cabinet, but only at night. The Ikea pantry light shuts off automatically after three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtmEfJij_sfBayfY7SeX6xn3Y54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342147/IMG_6299.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letting Ikea control the light, not HomeKit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g52PPACZ5t19AfmyZhsdTJDnXrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342135/IMG_6301.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pantry motion kicks off a secondary event in kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxP8uT"&gt;That three-minute reset built into the Ikea Motion sensor can cause conflicts with HomeKit automations. The Apple Home app lets you to assign automations to both motion and the lack of motion. It can also take a secondary action after a set period of time. For example, in the Apple Home app, I can tell the Ikea Motion Sensor to light a Hue bulb in the pantry instead, and then shut it off after one minute. However, it can’t be tripped again for another two minutes due to the three-minute sleep time, leaving me to rummage around the pantry in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PeTVT"&gt;Other motion sensors have much shorter reset periods, even as low as 20 seconds, which makes them much better suited for controlling lighting. Others also include temperature sensors, opening the door for even more creative automations. The Ikea Motion Sensor is basic by comparison with a price to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M2VAaV"&gt;Ikea’s Motion Sensors and Shortcut Buttons are so inexpensive and useful that they’re easy to recommend, especially for homes with a mix of Ikea and Apple products already. While the Motion Sensors are available just about everywhere, the new Shortcut Buttons have only started rolling out and still can’t be found in the US. Both HomeKit devices make the smart home accessible to everyone without apps or voice commands, limited only by the smart devices you own, your ability to write HomeKit shortcuts, and your patience with fiddly smart home tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s cashierless tech expands to London with first international store</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3EPWk"&gt;Amazon has opened its first cashierless store outside of the US with a new Amazon Fresh location in London, UK. The store uses the company’s Just Walk Out technology, which allows customers to pick items off shelves and take them out of the store without having to stop and pay a cashier. Billing is handled automatically, but requires customers to scan their Amazon app to enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhbeaj"&gt;The launch marks a major expansion of Amazon’s cashierless stores initiative. The technology powering the stores, which uses cameras to track shoppers and their purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13842592/amazon-go-new-cashier-less-convenience-store"&gt;debuted with Amazon’s first Go store&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle in 2016. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=16008589011"&gt;over two dozen Amazon Go stores across the US&lt;/a&gt;. Last year the initiative expanded with a larger grocery store called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon Go Grocery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWjitsabZuiNC4YYwdj7wJiN8Ug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344614/Amazon_Fresh_Food_to_Go.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The store will sell hot and cold food, as well as other everyday essentials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PBQxia"&gt;Amazon says its London store, whose existence in Ealing was &lt;a href="https://london.eater.com/22309002/amazon-go-grocery-uk-store-opening-ealing-broadway-london"&gt;spotted earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, will stock a range of groceries, and fresh meals. There’ll also be hot food sold under the company’s own “by Amazon” label, which it says are prepared in store. The aim is to offer customers “everything they’d want from their local neighbourhood grocery store,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq5Cba"&gt;The store opened its doors at 7AM this morning, and will be open until 11PM, seven days a week. It covers 2,500 square feet making it a similar size to the company’s Amazon Go locations in the US, and a lot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less#ocRfvw:~:text=The%20location%2C%20at%20610%20E.%20Pike,450%20and%20the%20largest%20is%202%2C700."&gt;smaller than its first Amazon Go Grocery store&lt;/a&gt;. Additional stores are planned for the Greater London area, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azNlYh"&gt;In the UK, the company is using its Amazon Fresh branding for its cashierless store, rather than Amazon Go like it’s done stateside. Confusingly, Amazon does have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;Amazon Fresh-branded store in the US&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, but it doesn’t use the company’s cashierless technology, and relies instead on high-tech shopping carts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZTIZ3"&gt;Due to the pandemic, the company has a series of hygiene-focused measures in place at the store. Its maximum occupancy is limited to 20 to allow for social distancing, and there’s PPE and disposable gloves available at the store’s entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qiU7Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s desktop app now has video and voice calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwz2BWtWDqx9X3wMTtzDJI8t9FI=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909380/whatsapp.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ak1jtA"&gt;WhatsApp’s desktop app for Mac and PC is getting voice and video calling today, the company announced, offering end-to-end encrypted calls to other WhatsApp users on both computers and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U63rtc"&gt;Voice and video calling isn’t a new idea for WhatsApp: the mobile apps for Android and iOS already offer the feature, and WhatsApp started to roll out the desktop calling feature to a small group of users at the end of last year. But today’s launch means that the feature is now available to all WhatsApp users on desktop, making calling a more ubiquitous feature across all WhatsApp devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JLz4Zq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No, Facebook can’t eavesdrop on your calls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Okiirr"&gt;And like the existing video calling feature, the new desktop calling promises the same end-to-end encryption — meaning that WhatsApp and Facebook can’t see or hear your calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKGJ6V"&gt;The biggest missing feature is that, at least to start, the desktop app will only support one-to-one calling, not group calls. WhatsApp does promise that it’ll be expanding to include support for group voice and video calls down the line, although it hasn’t said when that will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzNVaB"&gt;To use the new video calling feature, you’ll have to set up the WhatsApp desktop app on either Mac or PC, which requires that you already be a WhatsApp user on mobile. Once you’ve installed the app on your computer, users will then scan a QR code &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/download-and-installation/how-to-log-in-or-out/"&gt;to log in on the desktop app&lt;/a&gt;, after which they’ll be able to use the desktop version of WhatsApp with their usual account. &lt;/p&gt;
