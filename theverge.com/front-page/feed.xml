    <title>Apple and T-Mobile say iOS 15.2 didn’t switch off iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qF06W"&gt;Apple has denied that last month’s iOS 15.2 update is behind the difficulty some iPhone owners have faced with using the iCloud Private Relay feature on cellular networks. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile earlier this week said they weren’t blocking the VPN-like feature, but T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have identified that iOS 15.2 toggled it off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F54OgM"&gt;Now Apple says that’s not the case. After releasing an updated beta of iOS 15.3 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880835/apple-clarify-icloud-private-relay-error-messages-ios-15-3-cell-carriers"&gt;clarifies the language&lt;/a&gt; in iCloud settings, Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/"&gt;issued a statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saying that iOS 15.2 wasn’t the problem. “No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,” the statement reads. “Users are encouraged to check their Settings to see if Private Relay is enabled on their device or for a specific network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Lq8Yr2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jm2UUZ"&gt;T-Mobile has also followed up with &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; to say that that iOS 15.2 didn’t toggle the feature off after all. “Apple doesn’t change customers’ settings when they update to iOS 15.2,” the carrier says in a statement. “Customers may see an error message if they previously toggled iCloud Private Relay or Limit IP Address Tracking off in their Cellular Data Options Settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cTiEY"&gt;It’s still not entirely clear what caused all of this confusion, but the carriers do say they’re not blocking iCloud Private Relay (except for some T-Mobile plans that include content filtering services), so it’s worth double-checking your cellular settings to make sure everything’s the way it should be. Once the public version of iOS 15.3 is out, the language in settings won’t outright tell you that your cell plan doesn’t support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alleged Apple App Store scammer AmpMe lowers prices and says it’ll investigate its ‘consultants’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6MVzgbMo5nkWbSiV6DRM2wf2HY=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381697/ampme-0616.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nTluDF"&gt;AmpMe &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;a brand-new app that popped up just to scam unsuspecting users out of their money. See the photo atop this post? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9391461/ampme-music-streaming-app-syncing"&gt;That’s from 2015&lt;/a&gt;, when we first covered the idea: an app that can sync up a room full of smartphones into a single gigantic speaker with no fees in sight. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626605370142724"&gt;as App Store scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou points out&lt;/a&gt;, the app looks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;seriously shady more than six years later — if you downloaded it yesterday, it would immediately try to sell you on a $9.99 a week automatic recurring subscription. That’s $520 a year, an incredible sum if you pull it out as a party trick and then forget to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ82b8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626647300669440"&gt;AppFigures estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app has raked in $13 million since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MDwU9J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3. Buy lots of fake reviews on a daily basis (notice the pattern of all these non-sensical reviewer “names”): &lt;a href="https://t.co/VtabR80QkP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VtabR80QkP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626639067238403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s775Xb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;As we discussed last April&lt;/a&gt;, it’s ridiculously easy to find scams on Apple’s App Store — just follow the money and look at the reviews.  If you see an app that charges ridiculous subscription fees, yet still has loads of five-star ratings, something might be off. And if those reviews look absolutely fake, and the app’s barely functional, you’ve probably spotted a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvGrI4"&gt;What’s less easy to find: a company accused of scamming willing to stand up for itself.  Most are completely silent, but when we reached AmpMe for comment, we got a reply from its support email address. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="50KOyM"&gt;Hi Sean,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lfWoj"&gt;The free version of our app is the most popular version and the vast majority of our users never paid a dime. Given its reception and popularity, AmpMe is a valued app and works as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axaFLr"&gt;To claim that our users are commonly paying $520 per year does not reflect reality. For example, in 2021, the average user that subscribed and took advantage of our free trial paid a total average of $17. If you take only paying users, the average yearly subscription revenue is about $75. Internally, this has reinforced our belief that AmpMe’s pricing is transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPeNZ"&gt;Regarding the reviews, we hear the feedback loud and clear. Through the years, like most startups, we’ve hired outside consultants to help us with marketing and app store optimization. More oversight is needed and that’s what we are currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M21Dp"&gt;We always adhere to Apple’s subscription guidelines and are continually working to ensure their high standards are met. We also respect and value the community’s feedback. Therefore, a new version of the app with a lower price has already been submitted to the App Store for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWsjEi"&gt;The AmpMe Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImeJCu"&gt;We can’t confirm AmpMe’s numbers, but we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt. There are at least three other interesting takeaways in that reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8M9j9x"&gt;AmpMe isn’t denying that it hired someone to pump its brand in the App Store. Nor is it pledging not to do that in future. It’s simply pointing the blame somewhere else. Maybe it’s angry its consultants faked these reviews. Maybe it’s just annoyed they got caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S30gXi"&gt;AmpMe is lowering its price as a result of this scrutiny. In fact, the company’s update has already been approved and is live on the store. It’s $4.99 a week now, or $260 a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NaPwWS"&gt;AmpMe isn’t dropping its subscription tactics, which the company believes is “transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="x461FP"&gt;I downloaded a copy of AmpMe, and I have to admit it’s not quite as blatant as I expected having heard the news. While it absolutely does hit you with a subscription request the moment you open the app, tempts you into a three-day free subscription, and the little “X” to bypass that screen is hard to spot, the app does at least clearly say how much it’s going to charge in big white letters right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX39v"&gt;And if you do hit the “X” and skip the subscription, the app seems functional — if only as a way to watch music videos from YouTube while you chat with randos or friends, as the sync-multiple-phones-as-speakers functionality is locked behind AmpMe’s paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sOpOoB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Profiting off forgetfulness is common now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nK6Y0"&gt;So the fact that Apple isn’t pulling this one from the App Store (and instead appears to be helping AmpMe clean up the more obvious fake reviews, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/music-app-ampme-lowers-pricing-after-accused-of-being-an-app-store-scammer/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) doesn’t really surprise me. It’s not one of the worst offenders, and the state of the tech industry is that many, many companies profit from the “whoops, forgot to cancel my subscription” phenomenon, including Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfcrqX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;But as I suggested in September&lt;/a&gt;, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, the one that sells privacy as its brand and claims to put customers first, could do a heck of a lot more to show it. It could lead here instead of following. It could stop profiting from people’s forgetfulness, provide automatic refunds when people have been scammed, stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default, and kill off the star rating system that allows review fakes to flourish. Last October, it took one of those suggestions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;brought back a way to actually report App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;. We have more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tpp9cy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"},{"title":"The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zv8a8b"&gt;I do wonder how much more there is to this whole “outside consultants” idea that AmpMe mentions. It isn’t the first company Eleftheriou has uncovered where a seemingly legitimate app that’s been around for years sprouts a new set of fake reviews, and a new screen advertising an exorbitant subscription price that you have to pay or dismiss the first time you launch. (Many of these screens even look largely the same.) I wouldn’t be surprised if there are companies going around shopping this exact service to old apps, in exchange for a cut of the revenue. (&lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wajam-adware/"&gt;It seems like it may not be the first time&lt;/a&gt; AmpMe’s CEO cashed in on an old app, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1V7JC"&gt;If you’ve been approached by such a company, or work for such a company, I’d love to talk to you. I’m at sean@theverge.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yaf75G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geico made the Portal ad we never asked for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfm7dO9FE5C432EWb56L-bDwABw=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381646/The_Gecko_Visits_Portal___GEICO_Insurance_0_13_screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geico&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rawcGT"&gt;We’re still waiting on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452272/jj-abrams-portal-movie-valve-half-life-2013-script-production"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; movie that’s apparently been years in the making&lt;/a&gt;, but if you must see &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; icon / villain GLaDOS in some sort of cinematic, there’s a new Geico ad you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtPwBz30Pww"&gt;watch right here&lt;/a&gt; or at the top of this post. Yes, you read that correctly — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtPwBz30Pww"&gt;Geico actually made a &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt;-themed ad featuring GLaDOS&lt;/a&gt;, and the insurance company even got voice actor Ellen McLain to reprise her role as the famous robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yM8I4S"&gt;If you’ve seen any Geico ad featuring &lt;a href="https://geicocarinsurance.fandom.com/wiki/GEICO_Gecko"&gt;Martin the Gecko&lt;/a&gt; from the past many years (or perhaps forever, it feels like he’s always been a character I’m aware of), this ad will be familiar territory. Martin, armed with an &lt;a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Handheld_Portal_Device"&gt;Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device&lt;/a&gt;, makes a few quips (and of course mentions that it’s possible to save money by switching to Geico), and GLaDOS responds with a few characteristically ominous comments. Martin ends the commercial by jumping into a portal that turns out to be an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HE8tvRzEkg"&gt;infinite portal&lt;/a&gt;, lol. (It seems GLaDOS didn’t tell Martin how to escape such a predicament.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YhguO"&gt;It’s an odd ad. And guess what? It’s not Geico’s only video game-inspired commercial — the company released one in November &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGa89tAWVHs"&gt;featuring &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will clarify iCloud Private Relay error messages in iOS 15.3 to not blame cell carriers as much</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3DF4-0WNQ2LGPIXLaHWqCZAcq8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380977/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CoeElR"&gt;Apple is updating the wording for iCloud Private Relay issues in the latest iOS 15.3 beta, clarifying that problems with the service may be an inadvertently switched-off setting and not issues with a customer’s specific cell carrier, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/icloud-private-relay-clarification-ios-15-3/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUZct6"&gt;The old message put the blame for iCloud Private Relay not working squarely on the shoulders of cell carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ULsaTL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Your cellular plan doesn’t support ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay. With ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cQVN1J"&gt;Unsurprisingly, that wording &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;led to confusion earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; when customers couldn’t get iCloud Private Relay to work on cellular connections. The issue, at least according to T-Mobile, was actually on Apple’s end: it seems that the company’s recent iOS 15.2 update toggled off Private Relay for cellular data by accident, not that T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon had suddenly disabled the feature from working on their networks. The new wording makes things a little clearer that the issue might be an accidentally toggled setting elsewhere in iOS and not a cell company problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZAeNGD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Private Relay is either not supported by your cellular plan or has been turned off in Cellular Settings. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImUhRW"&gt;Apple has also updated its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614"&gt;iCloud Private Relay support document&lt;/a&gt; today to make it clearer that customers might not be able to use the feature if they’ve turned off the “Limit IP Address Tracking” toggle for specific Wi-Fi or cellular networks, along with how to fix that problem on their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fh2k9M"&gt;Hopefully, the new support document, clarified language from Apple, and the confirmations from all three major US carriers will be enough to put this week’s iCloud Private Relay confusion behind everyone. Given that the service is still technically in beta, though, it’s probably a good thing that Apple is sorting out the bugs now before it turns the service on by default. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is creating an online used car marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ms1dlnqmn10QIkHF5an2rbyUXQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380695/acastro_200406_1777_gm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s called CarBravo and is set to launch in the spring.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lL3NjY"&gt;The used car market is &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-01-03/29-000-for-an-average-used-car-would-be-buyers-are-aghast"&gt;red hot&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems General Motors wants to compete squarely with used vehicle sites like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carvana.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F12%2F22880695%2Fgm-general-motors-carbravo-online-used-car-marketplace-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carvana&lt;/a&gt; with a new website called CarBravo. GM is beginning to enroll dealers now to be a part of the site, which is set to launch in “spring 2022,” &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0111-carbravo.html"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9NBMS"&gt;CarBravo will not only let shoppers look at inventories from both dealers and GM’s central stock of used vehicles, but it will also let people shop for non-GM used vehicles, Steve Carlisle, GM’s EVP and president of GM North America, said in a statement. That could help it better take on Carvana (which just announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx2JxS6i3_g"&gt;it has sold one million cars&lt;/a&gt;) and other sites such as &lt;a href="https://www.carmax.com/"&gt;CarMax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vroom.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F12%2F22880695%2Fgm-general-motors-carbravo-online-used-car-marketplace-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vroom&lt;/a&gt;, which let people shop across many different car brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTpPcG"&gt;The rise of direct-to-consumer brands like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16059954/tesla-model-3-2017-auto-industry-influence-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547202/lucid-motors-air-electric-vehicle-hands-on-test-drive"&gt;Lucid&lt;/a&gt; have undermined the more traditional dealership / franchise system, so CarBravo could be a way for GM to dip its toes into that direct-to-consumer strategy. But the company has failed with bets like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229838/gm-maven-shut-down-car-sharing-service"&gt;Maven car-sharing service&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ll have to wait and see if CarBravo can break through against some of the more well-known online destinations for used cars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Buds Pro gain multipoint support after latest update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BB-0lQddCx6gyEBGXrzDHcwc2WM=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380501/DSCF4677_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYMgru"&gt;Multipoint support on earbuds has long been one of Jabra’s hallmarks, but slowly we’re starting to see other brands add the convenience to their buds. The latest is OnePlus, which is adding “dual connection” to its flagship OnePlus Buds Pro with a new firmware update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEaYR8"&gt;Once that update is installed, the Buds Pro will be able to connect to two devices at once, letting you seamlessly switch between, say, listening to music on your laptop and taking a call on your mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtpGkG"&gt;This functionality is common in a lot of premium wireless headphones but has been much slower to make its way to earbuds. For a long time multipoint was a big selling point for Jabra’s Elite 65t, 75t, and 85t earbuds. But other companies like Anker and JBL have increasingly been offering multipoint with their respective earbuds. Meanwhile Jabra’s latest earbuds actually shipped &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; multipoint at launch but should be updated to support it in the coming weeks. Jabra again confirmed the feature is on the way during CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYFYBv"&gt;In the case of the $149.99 OnePlus Buds Pro, multipoint adds more value to an already-excellent set of Bluetooth earbuds that feature good sound quality, impressive noise cancellation, and a very comfortable fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFxuqy"&gt;The company says this update is being rolled out incrementally, so not everyone’s going to have it right off the bat. &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-buds-pro-ota-pair-with-and-seamlessly-switch-between-2-devices.1533910/"&gt;On its forums&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus said, “the OTA update will initially reach a small percentage of users, and then we’ll begin a broader rollout over the next few days.” Early indications are that the dual connection feature is working just as advertised, so it’s good to see this convenient trick reaching more and more products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congressional watchdog calls for stronger regulation of crypto ATMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQJERcaOByTPmRNf2LmyqP35YlA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380462/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2U9Cq"&gt;In a public report issued earlier this week, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105462"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that the IRS and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) be given more information about the location of the kiosks where people can turn cash into crypto or vice versa. In its report, GAO cites crypto’s potential use in sex trafficking and drug dealing as the reason why the government should have more insight into one of the ways people obtain crypto outside of the more tightly regulated exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtMkQB"&gt;While kiosk operators already have to comply with several regulations (they have to register with FinCEN, keep transaction records, and collect extra information for transfers over $3,000), GAO argues that it’s still hard for government agencies to get a complete picture. Not only does the government have to deal with people running unregistered kiosk operations, but registered operators aren’t required to provide a list of locations where their kiosks are located. While they do have to give FinCEN access to detailed info about a specific kiosk if the regulator requests it, GAO says that the lack of location info makes it difficult to target investigations into areas with higher risk of drug or human trafficking activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O73OLe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The government doesn’t know where all the kiosks are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4S5pre"&gt;This report doesn’t carry any legal force but is likely to be influential in Congress. GAO provides nonpartisan recommendations and information to Congress and other policymakers, often setting the tone for complex new topics like cryptocurrency. Lawmakers had more extensive access to the report as well — the public version makes reference to information that was included in the original report, released in December, that was too sensitive to include for a general release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8w6h4"&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105462.pdf"&gt;full public version of GAO’s report here&lt;/a&gt; (pdf), which I recommend — it’s a detailed look into the state of play when it comes to enforcement. It goes deeper into the marketplaces where people sell drugs for crypto and the websites where sex workers can receive crypto for services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1GBTS"&gt;Crypto kiosks have been implicated in other forms of crime as well: recently, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765900/crypto-scam-fbi-psa-atm-qr-code-wire-transfer-con-artist"&gt;FBI released a PSA&lt;/a&gt; to warn the public about scammers using the ATMs to pull off a high-tech wire transfer fraud, conning people into converting cash into crypto and sending it off under false pretenses. Crypto in general has also been a big part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"&gt;the ransomware business plan&lt;/a&gt;, which FinCEN has been paying close attention to — last year the regulator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; saying that ransomware payments for 2021 were on track to reach a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iqzsPW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Addresses tied to illegal activity were only responsible for a tiny fraction of blockchain transactions in 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxhBt4"&gt;However, research suggests criminal activity actually makes up a small portion of blockchain transactions. Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, recently &lt;a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; estimating that addresses tied to illegal activity only carried out 0.15 percent of 2021 blockchain transactions. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/cryptocurrency-crime-2021-hits-all-time-high-value-chainalysis-2022-01-06/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that number is likely to go up as it continues to identify criminals’ addresses, but it’s a significant decrease from the percentage estimate of illegal activity for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAQglT"&gt;The report is coming at time when the government appears to be ramping up enforcement on unlicensed Bitcoin purchases. Last year, federal agents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599932/bitcoin-raid-keene-new-hampshire-ian-freeman-libertarian-prosecution"&gt;raided several people who operated Bitcoin vending machines&lt;/a&gt; in New Hampshire, accusing them of running an unlicensed money transmission business. The IRS has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524705/irs-congress-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;been asking lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to give it more authority to monitor large cryptocurrency transactions, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770798/biden-infrastructure-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-crypto-tax-irs-treasury"&gt;new tax reporting requirements to miners&lt;/a&gt; was bundled into the recent infrastructure bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1kqCv"&gt;The crypto community has pushed back against many of these moves — &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/12/dorsey-proposes-non-profit-bitcoin-legal-defense-fund-for-developers/"&gt;just this week&lt;/a&gt; former Twitter CEO and Bitcoin fan Jack Dorsey proposed a legal fund to help defend Bitcoin developers against “litigation and continued threats.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wear OS will work better for lefties... eventually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Fossil Gen 6 is a large watch, but looks good on my wrist" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7wgm7bjXlb_yORixXw-U7SM1EBQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380112/dbohn_211105_4864_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, us reviewers also tend to snap photos exclusively on the left wrist.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sk7XOn"&gt;Good news for Wear OS southpaws: Google is adding the ability to rotate the screen on Wear OS watches 180 degrees. There is, however, a catch — you might have to upgrade to get the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eolpy4"&gt;The news was initially spotted on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/s19lef/wear_os_is_finally_getting_an_option_to_rotate/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; by journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1480975675834212352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1480975675834212352%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Ffuture-wear-os-smartwatches-180-rotation"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt; and picked up by &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/future-wear-os-smartwatches-180-rotation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment142"&gt;Google IssueTracker thread&lt;/a&gt; requesting customizable screen orientation, a developer wrote, “Our development team has implemented the feature you have requested and will be available on future new devices.” That prompted &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment143"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment144"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78592658?pli=1#comment145"&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt;. On the one hand, the feature exists. On the other, it’s implied the feature may not make its way to all Wear OS smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUbaRL"&gt;Should this be the case, it’s understandable why Wear OS users are cheesed. It’s customary to wear your watch on your non-dominant hand — meaning your right wrist for lefties, and left wrist for right-handed people. However, as with most things, smartwatches cater to right-handed users. Southpaws who prefer wearing watches on their right wrist have to reach up and around to use the crown. But unlike analog watchmakers who needed to go out of their way &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/history-of-destro-left-handed-watches-and-why-they-benefit-everyone?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;to produce left-handed watches&lt;/a&gt;, the easy fix for smartwatches would be to just flip the display. The initial request for the feature on Wear OS was made nearly four years ago in April 2018. That’s a long wait, and requiring users to upgrade for basic features is always going to upset some customers. Making matters worse, Apple has let Apple Watch users customize screen orientation for years. For now, the only option for Wear OS users is workarounds like &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mutau.lefty"&gt;the app Lefty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fi4hdw"&gt;That said, this is the word of one developer. Until Google makes an official statement saying otherwise, it’s possible that this will eventually make its way to existing watches. After all, Wear OS 3 won’t be arriving for most eligible watches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;until the latter half of this year&lt;/a&gt;. Google has also repeatedly stated that during this awkward transition period, it’s committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423707/google-wear-os-gboard-swipe-type"&gt;bringing new features to Wear OS 2&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695976/youtube-music-wear-os-2-app-offline-downloads"&gt;YouTube Music app&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of a feature that launched with Wear OS 3 but was later brought to Wear OS 2 despite &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/youtube-music-wear-os-maps-release/"&gt;initial reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0STDE"&gt;“We always prioritize giving our users choice — that includes bringing new features to Wear OS,” Google spokesperson Ivy Hunt told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In regards to specifics on this feature, we do not comment on future roadmaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKTxtx"&gt;Picking which wrist you wear your smartwatch on actually matters quite a bit. Not only does it impact which side the crown or buttons are on, but it can also affect the accuracy of fitness tracking algorithms. Most smartwatches have different algorithms for your dominant versus non-dominant hand. It might also make using certain features, like EKGs, uncomfortable or downright unusable. For instance, Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; introduced a new body composition feature that requires you to place your fingers on the watch’s buttons. As you can see from &lt;a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,g_center,pg_1,q_60,w_1600/5b2812ea785b8a973f9f99ed6949b9aa.jpg"&gt;this photo&lt;/a&gt;, using the feature is ridiculous if you choose to wear the smartwatch on your right wrist — and since the Galaxy Watch 4 runs Wear OS 3, there’s &lt;a href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-Watch/Flip-screen-orientation-for-right-wrist/td-p/1977212"&gt;no way to switch screen orientation&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JT8BE"&gt;Even with the uncertain timeline, it’s excellent news that Google is adding this basic accessibility feature. You should be able to wear your smartwatch on whichever wrist you want, and accommodating lefties or people with limb differences benefits everyone. As a wearables reviewer, I wear a smartwatch on both wrists at all times. I can assure you, your experience with the same device can vary widely depending on which wrist you wear it. For instance, when I tested the Fitbit Sense on my right wrist, I constantly set off the capacitive button and ended up recording a lot of accidental workouts. All those problems went away when I switched the device to my left wrist, but it wouldn’t have been an issue if I could’ve flipped the orientation. Frankly, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; smartwatches and fitness trackers makers should be more thoughtful about this going forward. It’s a shame that most haven’t already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIvIsY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 01/12/2022, 4:05pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwR2tX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patches HomeKit denial-of-service bug with new iOS update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKIfW9xo6YGfBxgtaUb4cDK08us=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380017/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h7iO0"&gt;On Wednesday, Apple released the 15.2.1 version of iOS, a minor update to the mobile operating system that fixes bugs, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865145/apple-ios-vulnerability-homekit-devices-bug-crash"&gt;denial-of-service vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvcEXU"&gt;The 15.2.1 patch addresses a vulnerability triggered through HomeKit, the software API for connecting smart home devices to iOS applications. If the vulnerability was exploited, HomeKit devices labeled with a very long name would cause iPhones and iPads to endlessly freeze, crash, and reboot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTLX5z"&gt;Since HomeKit device names are backed up to iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device would trigger the crash again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pec8D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213043"&gt;security notification&lt;/a&gt; for the 15.2.1 update lists only one change, a fix for the HomeKit vulnerability. Details of the fix state that a “resource exhaustion issue was addressed with improved input validation,” presumably to prevent long HomeKit device names from being read into memory by iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQUHsu"&gt;Besides security updates, the patch also fixed a bug that impacted performance of third-party CarPlay apps and another that prevented the Messages app from loading certain photos sent via iCloud. Users can update iOS by opening the Settings app on a device and tapping “General,” then selecting “Software Update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RE9TA"&gt;The HomeKit bug was discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas, who &lt;a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"&gt;published details on his blog&lt;/a&gt; on January 1st. At the time, Spiniolas accused Apple of being slow to respond to his initial disclosure, which was made in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTr7iW"&gt;According to Spiniolas’ blog, the bug affects iOS versions at least as far back as 14.7 and likely before, meaning these devices are still vulnerable. Owners of iPhones or iPads should update their devices as soon as possible to benefit from the new update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House to launch COVID test-ordering site ‘by this weekend,’ reports say</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFIl1L"&gt;On Wednesday, a senior White House adviser said that a government-run website to order COVID-19 rapid tests “should be online by this weekend,” according to new reporting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffRBennett/status/1481273604729974790?s=20"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tests should start arriving this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7kAcw"&gt;The promise comes weeks after President Joe Biden announced that Americans would soon be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;order 500 million free COVID tests directly from the government&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ll have websites where you can get them delivered to your home,” Biden said in a speech on December 21st as the Omicron variant surged across the country. In prior remarks from White House press secretary Jen Psaki, the website would go live “as soon as these tests are available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cxfLy6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The website would go live “as soon as these tests are available”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kPttlG"&gt;Still, the White House has yet to provide any additional details about the website, like its exact launch date or how many tests a person is allowed to order at one time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXg4mi"&gt;The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhnRxX"&gt;The news comes on the heels of the Biden administration announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878196/covid-at-home-insurance-white-house-testing"&gt;a new policy&lt;/a&gt; requiring insurance companies to reimburse up to eight over-the-counter at-home &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-cb49a8458f33a698c3a4f3b721835270"&gt;COVID-19 tests starting January 15th&lt;/a&gt;. Under this new policy, details of which were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; by the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday, Americans will either have to purchase tests through their insurance or submit receipts for reimbursement. A family of four would be eligible for up to eight tests per person, per month.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH1ODp"&gt;In addition to the new government-run website and insurance reimbursement policy, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/02/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-protect-americans-against-the-delta-and-omicron-variants-as-we-battle-covid-19-this-winter/"&gt;is planning&lt;/a&gt; to provide 50 million free, at-home tests to community health centers and rural clinics across the country and to establish over 20,000 free community-based testing sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLDvts"&gt;In his December speech, Biden also announced that the administration is working with Google to make it easier for Americans to find testing locations when they search for testing sites through the search engine. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;Google spokesperson Lara Levin told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the testing arrangements are part of the company’s ongoing work “to make testing (and then vaccine) info available in Search and Maps.”&lt;/p&gt;
