  &lt;p id="NbdJCk"&gt;Easter is on Sunday, and if you celebrate the holiday but won’t be able to visit your family this year, a Zoom call is a great substitute to ensure you can still connect with your loved ones. A few devices support Zoom, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;including Amazon’s Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, which is on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="uhKwuI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GWOeX6"&gt;Amazon is also discounting its Fire HD 8 tablets, knocking $30 off the usual retail prices. You can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 tablet for only $60&lt;/a&gt;, or you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 Plus for $80&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the previous Fire HD 8 models, the latest tablets have a USB-C port for faster charging, and the HD 8 Plus supports wireless charging, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O0hIwm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Kara Verlaney on copy editing and its tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qxhE0te8X6VuzA6JdvIY9ZomC7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066184/kverlaney_210401_4504_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kara Verlaney / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWvn42"&gt;You may come across the occasional writer who will claim (wrongly) that they don’t need an editor, but you will seldom, if ever, meet a writer or editor who will say they don’t need a copy editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVM1Eu"&gt;The role of a copy editor is often misunderstood or underestimated by those not in the business. Kara Verlaney, senior copy editor for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, when asked to explain the role of a copy editor, put it this way: “Copy editing is about maintaining consistency and accuracy, which is what gives sites like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the authority to tell our audience about a subject. Beyond checking for grammatical errors and extolling the Oxford comma, copy editors also monitor things like sensitivity and tone, style, source diversity, and clarity. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s process has copy editors checking pieces right before publish, so we’re often the last line of defense before something goes up on the site.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvOmGs"&gt;We talked to Kara to find out how she does her job and what tools she uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="iakOVm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10420457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdauBB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your job at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6X8omK"&gt;I’m a senior copy editor, and I’ve worked here for five years. My day-to-day responsibilities vary, but a large portion of my time is dedicated to editing... everything we publish. That includes news stories, longform features, Instagram captions, video assets — there are a lot of words! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VydzlL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What hardware tools do you use? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6Ib4k"&gt;My sound preferences vary depending on the length and / or topic of the piece I’m editing. Sometimes I blast music; sometimes I enjoy silence while I read. While working remotely, I mostly rely on my AirPods Pro, which allow me to control the level of noise transparency. I also tend to move around my space a lot while I work, so I’m essentially glued to my 2019 MacBook Pro during the workday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JKYcJK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uaX2al"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What software tools do you and your colleagues use for your work? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6ZWrs"&gt;Various publications have created stylebooks to guide writers and editors — examples include &lt;em&gt;The Chicago Manual of Style&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;MLA Handbook&lt;/em&gt;. Each stylebook’s rules and formats differ slightly based on the content and audience, but consistency is universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3ExN7"&gt;Like many news organizations, our style largely follows &lt;a href="https://apstylebook.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; Stylebook&lt;/a&gt; (otherwise known as the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;). Its online topical style guides and Ask the Editor sections can be great language resources (although sometimes the answers are confounding). &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s default dictionary is &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/"&gt;Merriam-Webster’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Unabridged&lt;/a&gt;. It produces &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-games"&gt;weekly vocabulary quizzes&lt;/a&gt; that are super fun, if that’s your thing. I have &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; and M-W open at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cL2S0R"&gt;I do a majority of my editing in Google Docs or Vox Media’s CMS (content management system) Chorus, so I can leave comments and track changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4pe7sb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425606"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="trYFaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other tools do you use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkFwgm"&gt;One facet of managing the copy desk is updating and maintaining &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s style guide and communicating those rules to writers. Some of our house style is unique to our publication, so we differ somewhat from &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; style. Language is constantly evolving and changing, so I need to stay on top of what other publications and style guides are doing to ensure our language stays relevant and inclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9vbDQ"&gt;I love using physical style manuals — any time I can avoid staring at a screen, I do! — but most of my hard copies are still gathering dust at the office. I did bring one home with me, though: Strunk and White’s &lt;em&gt;Elements of Style, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is essentially the lifeblood of any editor. The illustrated edition pictured at the top of this article was given to me as a gift, particularly due to its cover. (As my co-workers will tell you, I solicit pictures of dogs and other pets as a form of emotional currency.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUBArJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice do you have for people who are considering copy editing as a profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMjqAP"&gt;Being a copy editor is a very involved job. You have to communicate well with the writers, editors, and creators you work with; operate efficiently under some tight deadlines; and try to understand the essence of every story you read, cataloging some of that information to reference later. It’s fairly nuanced work for being so prescriptive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uifrVO"&gt;I’d recommend reading as much as you can and refreshing your grammar skills. (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; creates &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/insider/copy-edit-this-quiz.html"&gt;copy edit quizzes&lt;/a&gt;; I’ve gotten a perfect score on very few.) There are also tools like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grammarly.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22358493%2Fcopy-edit-tools-tech-airpods-stylebook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; that will highlight and explain various parts of speech and language rules, which some people find really helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i73pDT"&gt;Mostly, you need a willingness to relearn (and unlearn) a bunch of rules you were probably taught in fourth grade English class. Language is learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGQfjM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s Base Station Pro wireless charger is half price this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DsuKDODs7tDjNpqN6nVJl3O-sI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69066043/cgartenberg_200824_4157_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpGgFA"&gt;Nomad’s well-designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a Qi wireless charger that can charge up to three devices simultaneously — perfect if you have a phone, watch, and earbuds. If its $200 price tag has been a stumbling block, Nomad is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeDealExclusiveApril2021&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-station-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50 percent discount on the charger&lt;/a&gt; until Sunday, April 4th, at 2:59AM ET (Saturday at 11:59PM PT if you’re on the West Coast). To get this price, enter the code &lt;strong&gt;VOX &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. If you have an Apple Watch, you can also add the Apple Watch attachment for $5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NuQVzZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e2exU5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;My colleague Chaim Gartenberg reviewed the Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt; when it released in August 2020. What makes this different from most other Qi wireless charging pads are its Aira FreePower coils, which allow for a better connection to your device’s own charging coil. Traditional coils tend to generate more energy and heat than is necessary to recharge your tech, but that’s another way Aira’s tech inside of the Base Station Pro differs. Chaim says in his review that “it’s practically impossible to miss when placing your phone down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4L1OG"&gt;There are a few things you should know before taking the plunge with this deal: if you’re charging, say, an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time, they’ll all recharge at 5W, which is the slowest standard speed. With just an iPhone, it can reach up to 7.5W. Though anything else (even Android devices that support fast Qi charging) will be limited to 5W. Lastly, Nomad says on the product page that the MagSafe magnets built into the iPhone 12 series drastically reduce the charging efficiency of the Base Station Pro. It expects the iPhone 12 mini to recharge in about eight hours, with the bigger iPhone 12 Pro Max taking about nine and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse defined a format — now it has to defend it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJVNqCTU6a8hXZj6j9VJ0-mmNns=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065999/VRG_ILLO_4505_Clubhouse.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1CqRy"&gt;Clubhouse had an incredible year in one most of us would rather forget. The live audio app launched during a pandemic; gained more than 10 million downloads for an invite-only, iOS-only app; and succeeded to the point that most every social platform wants to copy it. Congrats to Clubhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOkwwx"&gt;The company now faces its biggest challenges yet, however. For one, the pandemic is waning, and people might be more interested in real-life socializing instead of conversations facilitated through their phone. Anyone advertising their backyard as the next great Clubhouse competitor has a point. But for the people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; end up wanting to talk to each other online, they’ll soon have a lot more places to do so. In case you haven’t kept up: Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (reportedly), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; have all launched or are working on their own attempts at social audio — the space is about to get busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1JABh"&gt;The great concern for Clubhouse is that, as I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1360387683659481088"&gt;postulated&lt;/a&gt; in February, social audio could follow the same trajectory as Snapchat’s Stories function: a brilliant social media-altering idea that goes on to live in every app to the detriment of the upstart that pioneered the format. And social audio is shaping up to go that way. With the threat growing, it’s worth looking at where Clubhouse is most likely to run into problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NabghB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Social audio will likely follow the same trajectory as stories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EuYMsv"&gt;But first: what does Clubhouse have going for it? It was the first to social audio, and that’s something. Already, it counts millions of users who come to Clubhouse solely for social audio content, and that includes headline-grabbing names like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other celebrities. Tech CEOs are even making announcements in Clubhouse, including Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield, who announced his company’s own copycat product in the app. The app generates news and discussions — that’s something much trickier for other companies to clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oB6Czr"&gt;People have also built habits around Clubhouse, which is a positive sign for user retention. The team also plans to launch a creators program in the near future that’ll reward its most dedicated users with revenue and resources to beef up their shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53A0Mr"&gt;And critically, the app has staffed up in just the past month. The company recently poached Fadia Kader from Instagram to lead its media partnerships and creators. At Instagram, she worked with musicians to help them optimize their work on the platform. Presumably, she’ll be doing something similar at Clubhouse. Already, I’ve seen her in a room with Justin Bieber talking about his most recent album. Clubhouse also hired Maya Watson from Netflix to become its head of global marketing, meaning it’ll soon dedicate resources to promoting Clubhouse rather than relying primarily on word of mouth. These are all important steps to keeping Clubhouse interesting and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZeloFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse is staffing up and working on an Android app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHedN"&gt;But the app now faces competition from some of the world’s biggest platforms, which already have years of moderation experience, are available on iOS and Android, and have massive, loyal user bases to whom they can push social audio. Some companies, like Twitter and Discord, already pushed social audio features live to their millions of users with effectively the same interface as Clubhouse. Anyone who didn’t have an invite to Clubhouse, or an iPhone, now can access the magic of social audio with no association to Clubhouse whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pX5c6j"&gt;Maybe the most dangerous possibility for Clubhouse, however, is how easily it could lose the big names on its platform to challengers. Spotify, which announced this week that it acquired Betty Labs, the maker of the sports-centric social audio app Locker Room, plans to bring the app to Android, change its name, and broaden its coverage to music, culture, and sports. It could directly compete with Clubhouse for talent. Joe Rogan, for example, recently joined a Clubhouse chat, and although Spotify’s head of R&amp;amp;D &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;tells me&lt;/a&gt; the company won’t restrict its podcasters from using other social audio apps, it’s easy to imagine the company encouraging the use of its own. Musicians, like Bieber, who maybe came to Clubhouse to debut music, might turn to Spotify’s app instead to maintain relationships with the streaming giant. As a point of reference, when Kylie Jenner &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/snapchat-update-kylie-jenner/index.html"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that she barely opened Snapchat anymore, the company’s stock lost $1.3 billion. If stars like Tiffany Haddish decide to spend their time elsewhere, Clubhouse will falter, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeeVn3"&gt;At the same time, a few of these competitors are specifically interested in building native recording into their app, possibly to fuel the podcasting ecosystem and on-demand listening. Clubhouse has yet to do this. Fireside, which was co-founded by Mark Cuban, allows people to input sound effects, like music, and record their shows for distribution across podcasting platforms, as well as later playback on the app itself. Spotify will likely do the same with its app and rely on its Anchor software to handle hosting and distribution. Twitter’s head of consumer product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321158/twitter-spaces-record-conversation-kayvon-beykpour"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it, too, would let people natively record their Spaces. Clubhouse hasn’t built that functionality, limiting its users to only live conversations, which can be hard to follow if they join them midway through. Context collapse will challenge every platform that focuses on live, but some of Clubhouse’s competitors are already working to solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rmHowe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse’s competitors already have Android apps and are looking into native recording functions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="szy5IN"&gt;Stories made Snapchat a success. It pioneered the idea of ephemeral content and brought some semblance of authenticity back to social media. But it didn’t take long for the functionality to come to the same competitors Clubhouse now faces. To make its business work, Snapchat doubled down on its Android app, made the app more approachable to new users through a redesign, and aggressively pursued content partnerships with media and entertainment companies. It now pays users to make content for its TikTok competitor Spotlight and supports a growing ad business, but Instagram ultimately came away with the crown for Stories. Clubhouse hasn’t yet pursued ads or subscriptions, but that’ll be the next step to make it a self-supported platform. (Notably, though, its competitors, like Facebook, already rule ad targeting, possibly making Clubhouse’s job of selling ads or access to the platform itself tougher.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMHLd1"&gt;None of this is to say Clubhouse won’t survive or build a strong business in the coming months and years. It just needs to stay in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8BitDo now makes the best Switch pro controller</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Pro 2 gives you more features for less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="670ZAT"&gt;Nintendo’s official Pro Controller for the Switch is generally a pretty useful accessory, but it has its problems: the D-pad is unreliable, and it doesn’t really offer any “pro-level” functionality. 8BitDo’s latest controller improves on both of those issues while coming in at a lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDtjlu"&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 is an upgraded version of the SN30Pro Plus, already a well-regarded Switch controller. It uses Bluetooth and also works with PCs and mobile devices; there’s a physical control for flipping between Switch, X-input, D-input, and Mac. You can use it as a wired controller with a USB-C cable, too. I did try using it with my PC, but I feel like it makes more sense on the Switch due to the Japanese-style button layout with B on the bottom and A on the right. Or maybe I’m just too used to using Xbox controllers on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LmpJmn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10425473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C2O6qM"&gt;Aesthetically, it looks kind of like a cross between a SNES pad and a PlayStation controller, with a lozenge-shaped body, two handles, and symmetrically aligned analog sticks. The unit I have is decked out in a PlayStation-inspired gray colorway, though there’s also an all-black option and a beige model that evokes the original Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5msmA3"&gt;It’s not a huge controller, but it feels comfortable in my large hands, with easy access to all of the buttons and triggers. Just as importantly for me, the D-pad is good. It feels more or less like a SNES pad, and its placement above the left analog stick makes it more appropriate for games where it’s a primary input option. I’d much rather use the Pro 2 than Nintendo’s Pro Controller for just about any 2D game on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJo6CloJtJrnXDtsyayLpcWHz6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415567/09_l.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jOBeFz"&gt;The Pro 2’s key feature over its predecessor is the customizable back buttons that you can press with your middle finger. These are a common element of enthusiast-focused controllers today, from Microsoft’s Elite controllers to third-party offerings like the Astro C40 for the PS4. Sony also released an attachment that brings similar functionality to the DualShock 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2D8Te"&gt;These buttons are useful because they allow you to enter commands without taking your thumbs off the sticks. Most first-person shooters, for example, assign jumping to a face button, which means it can be awkward to activate while aiming at the same time. With controllers like the Pro 2, you can set a back button to work the same way as a given face button, freeing you up to design more flexible control schemes. The Pro 2 makes it much easier to manipulate the camera in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; battle, which might be worth the asking price alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmTyoI"&gt;The back buttons on the Pro 2 are responsive and clicky, activating with a slight squeeze. You can assign them through 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software app, which is now available for the Pro 2 on iOS and Android as well as PCs. It’s not quite as simple as some pro controller setups that let you remap the buttons directly on the controller itself, but it does support multiple profiles and works well enough. Beside button assignments, the app can also be used to modify the controller’s vibration strength and stick sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFwEbAZkw-2k0rYzhWc_gAL5088=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415579/DSCF7699.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XcEtXZ"&gt;You do miss out on some of the Switch Pro Controller’s features with the 8BitDo Pro 2. While the rumble is solid, it doesn’t feel as precise as Nintendo’s HD Rumble in supported games. The Pro 2 also lacks an NFC reader, so it won’t work with Amiibo figurines. And it can’t be used to power the Switch on, which is common to most third-party controllers across various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iV1Kjb"&gt;For $49.99, though, those omissions are understandable. That’s $20 less than Nintendo’s equivalent option, let alone the pro controllers you’d find for the Xbox or PlayStation in the $180–$200 range. And all things considered, I’d take the 8BitDo Pro 2 over the official Nintendo controller most days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJ0nVB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 will start shipping on April 12th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 bundles are in stock at GameStop [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCa4DJ0CcIrpvBef0PApVc97RoE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065781/vpavic_4278_20201030_0281.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAemQF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 2nd, 2021: 9:47AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; GameStop has sold all of the stock available for its three PS5 bundles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFuyG"&gt;If you have been keeping up with PS5 news, you will know that it is nearly impossible to find this console right now because of the short supply and mostly online-only sales. If you don’t mind buying a bundle, which includes additional items alongside the PS5, GameStop has restocked &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-with-ps-plus-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225171T.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-spider-man-ultimate-edition-and-call-of-duty-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170F.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-action-collection-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170G.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundles&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ8ICJ"&gt;There are two bundles we found that may be worth a buy if you are interested in what each package contains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tkmAH"&gt;The PS5 Digital Edition bundle — which includes the console, plus one-year subscriptions for PS Plus and PS Now, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card — is selling for $600, or about $200 more than the console alone goes for. Purchasing all of these items individually would tally up to the same $600, so you’re not forced into a marked-up price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9QOBwi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-spider-man-ultimate-edition-and-call-of-duty-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170F.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second bundle costs $730&lt;/a&gt;. At that price, it nets you one PS5 with a disc drive, two $70 games (&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ultimate Launch Edition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War)&lt;/em&gt;, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card. Normally, all this stuff would retail for roughly $720 before tax, so there is a small price increase if you were to buy these items separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TPl5cX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcHuE8"&gt;There is also a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-action-collection-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170G.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third bundle up for sale today at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. For $760, you get the following: a PS5 console, which includes the disc drive; three games (&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt;), an extra controller, plus a $20 gift card to GameStop. Adding up all these items together separately retails for about the same, so there’s no price gouging going on here, assuming you want all of these add ons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RWStGn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HRiiTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1uqxNf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s WeWork documentary gives us Adam Neumann and little else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="WeWork Presents Second Annual Creator Global Finals At Microsoft Theater" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0YVC07IwbctBNCSgCKO_qLRRQ4=/0x0:5777x3851/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065722/1079941750.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for WeWork&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocOEWx"&gt;The problem of making a documentary about a showman is that it’s hard not to be ensnared by him. &lt;em&gt;WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn&lt;/em&gt; is so focused on WeWork’s turbulent co-founder, Adam Neumann, that it ultimately loses the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsDD1s"&gt;WeWork, you may recall, was the subject of a tremendous scandal around the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;disclosures in the S-1 document required for its IPO&lt;/a&gt;. (The company is now &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/adam-neumanns-final-wework-act-helping-softbanks-spac-deal.html"&gt;attempting to go public using a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, which means someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;other than the SEC is doing the due diligence&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt;, premiering April 2nd on Hulu, is director Jed Rothstein’s abbreviated retelling of the events around the troubled company — but a lot of the weird details that made the WeWork story so riveting are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="URl7HU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neumann lifts a leg, lets out an audible fart, and then scolds the crew for laughing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNevfx"&gt;Some of the footage of Neumann is compelling. In the first few minutes of the documentary, we see a haggard Neumann trying to film a video for his IPO roadshow; very quickly, he lifts a leg, lets out an audible fart, and then scolds the crew for laughing too long. But the documentary’s focus on Neumann’s kooky antics in some ways obscures his veritable army of enablers, from Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son to his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, who is barely mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUFgOL"&gt;In doing this, the movie makes the same mistake that Reeves Wiedeman’s &lt;em&gt;Billion Dollar Loser&lt;/em&gt; does: it obscures just how weird things were at WeWork. Adam Neumann probably would have been allowed to continue smoking weed and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-ceo-adam-neumann-invested-in-wavegarden-wave-startup-2019-9"&gt;investing in wave pools&lt;/a&gt; forever if the company had turned a profit. When WeWork was on the upswing, his eccentricities were treated as proof of his genius. (Steve Jobs was eccentric, too!) The story isn’t Adam — it’s a dysfunctional business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMTYQO"&gt;To the movie’s credit, it gives the value proposition for WeWork. See, 2008 was a &lt;em&gt;real estate&lt;/em&gt; crisis — though we remember the housing crisis, commercial real estate crashed, too. WeWork was a high-risk arbitrage play: sign a long-term lease with a distressed property at a low rate, design a cute workspace, and then charge people to work there. WeWork’s insight was to design in ways that catered to millennials: great coffee, welcoming decor, good food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMsTJI"&gt;Unfortunately, the documentary didn’t stick with real estate. Had Rothstein done so, there would have been more detail on how WeWork rented buildings from Adam Neumann. Ideally, there also would have been a glimpse into WeWork’s January 2019 rebranding to The We Company. This move cost WeWork $5.9 million, which went to We Holdings LLC, controlled by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey. (The deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516585/wework-the-we-company-rebrand-adam-neumann"&gt;was later unwound&lt;/a&gt;.) Both related-party transactions would have required approvals — it would have been nice to know how those meetings went and who was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GHLLfW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rather than hard-nosed reporting, we get a lot of footage of Adam and generalizations about millennials&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rms5e3"&gt;Instead, these major red flags are mentioned briefly at the end, as part of the S-1 scandal. Rather than hard-nosed reporting, we get a lot of footage of Adam and generalizations about millennials. WeWork was something to believe in for a lot of vulnerable young people. This movie isn’t the first time WeWork has been compared to a cult and won’t be the last. (The title of &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporters Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell’s forthcoming book is &lt;em&gt;The Cult of We&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEo25v"&gt;The cult-y company wasn’t exactly unusual at the time; it’s a feature of Anna Wiener’s &lt;em&gt;Uncanny Valley&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;too. Some of WeWork’s woo-woo vibe comes from Rebekah Neumann, who ran WeGrow, the school portion of The We Company. Rebekah studied at the Kabbalah Centre and got Adam to attend as well. That spirituality was good for business since the Kabbalah headquarters was also where Adam met early investors &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/rebekah-neumanns-search-for-enlightenment-fueled-weworks-collapse-22581874"&gt;such as Ashton Kutcher&lt;/a&gt;. Arguably, without Rebekah’s influence, WeWork wouldn’t have been able to play as much on its employees’ need to believe. The closest &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt; comes to explaining any of this is a shot in which we glimpse a red string bracelet on Adam’s wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxOX99"&gt;A consistent feature of reporting on Adam is how charismatic he’s said to be. But this movie doesn’t deliver a charismatic leader, either — just a repetitive one. That’s a limitation of the footage: it’s all stuff Adam knows is being shot, and it’s all in service of a WeWork PR campaign. So that footage wouldn’t include, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827"&gt;for instance&lt;/a&gt;, the evening all-hands where Neumann talked about firing 7 percent of staff — then handed out shots and had Run-DMC’s Darryl McDaniels play a set that included “It’s Tricky.” To get anecdotes like that, you have to talk to people who were there. The documentary does this a little, but the employees are underused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXVI0D"&gt;Though we see Joanna Strange, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-25/wework-s-first-whistleblower-joanna-strange-tells-her-story?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the company’s first whistleblower&lt;/a&gt;, her appearance is brief — and the documentary doesn’t mention that WeWork sued her, and even sicced the FBI on her. (In fact, though &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1290356"&gt;the court system&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-directors-sue-softbank-over-terminated-3-billion-share-offer-11586271317"&gt;is seething&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/business/wework-neumann-discrimination-complaint.html"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17969190/wework-lawsuit-sexual-assault-harassment-retaliation"&gt;WeWork lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;, we get very little mention of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/weworks-adam-neumann-to-get-extra-50-million-payout-in-softbank-settlement-11614220906"&gt;any legal action&lt;/a&gt;.) Strange is one of the primary sources for &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Foundering&lt;/em&gt; podcast, which details what the company cost its employees. Her recordings, aired on that podcast, show us what Adam sounded like when he didn’t know he was on the record — and contains far more commentary from WeWork employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UW6iZS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The worst whiff is the movie’s corny ending&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="777O2p"&gt;I also would have liked to hear more about WeLive, which sounds like a college dorm for twenty-somethings. Bonds were apparently intense; if you had friends outside WeLive, they came over once and never returned. Gradually, people who lived at WeLive formed a closed community. I would have &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; to know more about who chose to live there and why. Hell, WeLive is probably its own documentary. It would have been nice, too, to hear from a WeGrow parent or three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2RIaV"&gt;The worst whiff is the movie’s corny ending. You see, everyone who was interviewed talks about the importance of community while putting their masks back on — because, of course, this was filmed during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Krjj7v"&gt;Here’s the thing: community &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;powerful! After all, that’s what binds people to cults even when they are experiencing doubt. Cult members aren’t stupid; they are usually educated, conscientious people who want to do good in the world, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bounded-Choice-Believers-Charismatic-Cults/dp/0520240189?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to cult expert Janja Lalich&lt;/a&gt;. They’re just vulnerable — much like twenty-somethings who’ve never had jobs before and don’t know what’s normal in a workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qy6JFi"&gt;To end &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt; with inane platitudes about the importance of community is also to sell WeWork’s employees short. These people, often very young, worked grueling hours and therefore had little time outside their jobs. That kept them bound to their co-workers, the only form of community many of them had — and made it much harder to quit. When the IPO blew up, Adam got a golden parachute while these hard-working employees found out &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-employees-feel-sting-as-ex-ceo-stands-to-reap-11571870011"&gt;their stock options were worthless&lt;/a&gt;. They deserved better from WeWork. They also deserved better from this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sBZrV"&gt;WeWork was expanding so fast that its offices frequently weren’t done on the first day they were open; the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/who-makes-wework-phone-booths-a-now-defunct-manufacturer?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;carcinogenic fumes in the phone booths&lt;/a&gt; were, it turns out, the tip of the shoddy iceberg. (&lt;em&gt;Foundering&lt;/em&gt; has the best account of the mundane horrors WeWork employees dealt with: beer keg disasters, buildings that opened without bathrooms, condom wrappers in upsetting places, and thundering herds of mice.) The documentary &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt; feels like a rushed attempt to slap together archival footage, and in so doing, tells the story of one &lt;em&gt;wild and crazy guy&lt;/em&gt;. If I’m McKelvey — or a WeWork board member, or anyone else who should have reined Adam Neumann in — I’d breathe a sigh of relief: I’m off the hook. Much like WeWork itself, Rothstein’s movie delivers mostly bombast, with little substance to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPotIm"&gt;	.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supercell is making three new Clash of Clans games to further expand its fantasy universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vq9X4e4u1zRjQgkbJlDLvrpBKpA=/0x55:2574x1771/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065703/Clash_Heroes.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyOeO8"&gt;Finnish developer Supercell is best known for its mobile games &lt;em&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;, and today, it announced plans to expand that fantasy universe in a big way. Supercell revealed that three new &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; titles are in development. “On top of offering a new &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; experience to current players, we want to broaden &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; to new audiences who haven’t experienced &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; before,” the developer wrote in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvO993"&gt;The games include: &lt;em&gt;Clash Ques&lt;/em&gt;t, a turn-based tactical adventure game; &lt;em&gt;Clash Mini&lt;/em&gt;, a virtual board game where you build teams of adorable miniatures; and &lt;em&gt;Clash Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, a co-op action roleplaying game. Supercell also notes that they’re all fairly early in development and will likely change in some ways as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LUwkug"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eKE9pf01FY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meEBjC"&gt;In fact, the developer is somewhat infamous for killing games in beta, so some of these titles might not see a wide release at all. “With your feedback, we think these three can become the great games that &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; fans deserve,” the developer says. “If they don’t meet the standards though, we’ll kill them and move on to other attempts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnTxmr"&gt;Even still, the trio of games represents a big push from the company to expand its popular fantasy universe; last year, Supercell also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21430993/clash-of-clans-royale-animated-short-youtube-supercell"&gt;its first CG animated short&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2016, there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14053766/clash-a-rama-animated-series-the-simpsons-supercell-clash-of-clans"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; webseries helmed by writers who worked on &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The push also shows the company’s growth in recent years. Two of the games — &lt;em&gt;Mini &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt; — will be the first titles out of Supercell’s new Shanghai studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz674w"&gt;“It’s important to note that the &lt;em&gt;Clash of Clans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; game teams are 100 percent separate from the three [new] &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; games (and the dev teams behind them),” the developer says. “Meaning these new &lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; games won’t impact any development or support for existing Supercell games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uhUQU"&gt;There’s no word on when any of the new games will start rolling out in beta, but Supercell says it also has several other non-&lt;em&gt;Clash&lt;/em&gt; games in development.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3yyBfDi59-rgjwgEpSr71IKT38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69065582/akrales_190918_3645_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1avaZy"&gt;Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362624/fantasian-release-date-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;the latest release from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which is joined by other titles like new versions of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Oregon Trail&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; World of Demons &lt;/em&gt;from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehBqNs"&gt;For the greats, Apple is adding a number of high-profile mobile hits to the service, including &lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mini Metro&lt;/em&gt;, and a remaster of &lt;em&gt;Cut the Rope&lt;/em&gt;. Timeless classics, meanwhile, refers to iconic games like backgammon, solitaire, and Zach Gage’s recent takes on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage"&gt;sudoku&lt;/a&gt;. While most Arcade games are playable across Apple TV, Mac, and iOS, these new categories will only work on iPhone and iPad. The update adds more than 30 titles to the service, bringing the entire library to more than 180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYldDU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20870146/apple-arcade-launch-best-top-games-iphone-ipad-apple-tv"&gt;Apple Arcade first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman"&gt;a new option for premium games&lt;/a&gt; on a platform that had become dominated by free-to-play experiences. The original pitch was a service full of new, largely exclusive games from developers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt; and a number of indie stalwarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4Th5X"&gt;However, despite the quality games and relative low price (an Arcade subscription is $4.99 per month), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308657/apple-arcade-canceling-games-subscription-service-engagement"&gt;Apple is reportedly not happy&lt;/a&gt; with the amount of engagement games are getting, which may be a reason behind this most recent shift in direction.&lt;/p&gt;
