    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5TvUOM"&gt;The year 2020 likely kept many of us inside for most of it, and it looks like that situation may last at least into part of 2021. One of the few positives is that many great movies and TV shows were released on streaming services such as Netflix. The streaming service has made available a plethora of movies and TV shows, some original to Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGzxnt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/"&gt;Netflix currently offers three plans&lt;/a&gt;: Basic ($8.99 / month) lets you watch content on one screen at a time; Standard ($13.99 / month) brings it up to two screens and adds HD content; and Premium ($17.99) offers a total of four screens and Ultra HD content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULmq9Y"&gt;Whether you need a new show to binge-watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174856/the-office-netflix-peacock-streaming"&gt;once &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; leaves Netflix&lt;/a&gt; or something for a movie night with your loved ones, here’s a list of 10 movies and TV shows you should check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="4duMyI"&gt;To the Lake&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To the Lake " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4VdoOFssJkImc7fGPajofBN1jCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170545/5f908f3f85600a70515e646a.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the Lake &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ueAdMy"&gt;A 2019 Russian web TV series acquired by Netflix this year, &lt;em&gt;To the Lake,&lt;/em&gt; is based on the Russian novel &lt;em&gt;Vongozero&lt;/em&gt; by Yana Vagner and focuses on a group of survivors trying to evade a pandemic. The main character is Sergey, who is tasked with getting his family to a desert island in the middle of an area called Vongozero. Sergey is joined by his new girlfriend, her son, his father, his next-door neighbor’s family, his ex-wife, and his young son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOfNyl"&gt;It’s quite unconventional compared to other shows in the apocalyptic zombie genre because it focuses more on its ensemble cast of diverse characters and adds a ton of tension, especially between Sergey’s new girlfriend and his ex-wife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="25f4Gt"&gt;#Alive&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="#Alive " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WZQJjc0k1vll6vsCuY7v-rFpCzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170567/AAAABZ0YASBbNXtrybLoLlCp4ktnzkk2DpGGInuM_7I21jdSkENpyTVuKC71CzV6AnSXB5kIc7Y4Tz4Rgl__dII9Q1NMyg4j.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;#Alive &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uI8X2c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;#Alive&lt;/em&gt; is a 2020 South Korean film that focuses on Joon-woo, a video game live-streamer, as he struggles to survive during — yes — a zombie apocalypse. For most of the movie, Joon-woo is barricaded in his parent’s apartment in Seoul. What makes this an intriguing watch is that it accurately depicts some of the same feelings many of us likely had due to the COVID-19 pandemic: fear, uncertainty, isolation, and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zF4TE2"&gt;Tiger King&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tiger King" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PpCo0jM-TctEUZ8dlx-uB_EwNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170575/IMG_0085_2520JEPA_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RQvrtr"&gt;Internet memes aside, &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; is one of the more enjoyable Netflix shows to come out of 2020. It’s a documentary miniseries that spans seven episodes and focuses on Joe Exotic, a private zoo owner with over 200 big cats. The miniseries focuses on various points in his life, such as his unsuccessful runs for public office and his feud with big-cat rights activist Carole Baskin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gc2IFS"&gt;Love is Blind&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Love is Blind " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhjS61TvJ2wkraWkLU--Pz9jg5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170644/love_is_blind_reaction.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love is Blind &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="axP5D8"&gt;This year, Netflix had a ton of dating shows with wild concepts&lt;em&gt;. Love is Blind&lt;/em&gt; brings together 30 men and women looking for love. For 10 days, the men and women partake in a blind / speed dating format where they “date” each other while in different “pods.” After those 10 days of dating, the participants need to decide if they want to become engaged or go home single. All these reality TV shows are very much guilty pleasures — at first watch, I got some mad &lt;em&gt;Married at First Sight &lt;/em&gt;vibes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SCOLpS"&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tuca &amp;amp;amp; Bertie" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3sUzQIe37NaLCQ9aqKvWAKHCM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16336445/Tuca___Bertie_S01E04_9m0s12962f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fBO7LZ"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;BoJack Horseman&lt;/em&gt; airing its final episodes in January, there’s a bit of a void for that type of animation. Last year, my best friend recommended that I watch &lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie&lt;/em&gt;, about two bird women in their 30s with a very Yin and Yang type friendship. I really enjoyed the amount of diversity in the cast and how the show starred two female protagonists, something I find to be a rarity in adult animation TV shows. And so I was really angry when I heard Netflix decided to cancel the series after one season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXJ4LS"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267667/tuca-and-bertie-season-two-adult-swim-netflix-renewed-saved-bojack-horseman-lisa-hanawalt"&gt;the show is getting a second season&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim block, with new episodes slated to premiere next year. You can still watch the first season on Netflix, and if you enjoy shows like &lt;em&gt;BoJack Horseman&lt;/em&gt;, I strongly encourage you to go watch &lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie&lt;/em&gt; as soon as possible. Then ask yourself, “How could Netflix &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; renew this show?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JI6uH1"&gt;The Witcher&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Witcher" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxKWILHaNtb0VWuTx8kJQnu8XbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19536938/GRADED_Witcher_104_Unit_01815_RT.fk3wl2edf__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rCglcL"&gt;I got my first experience with &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; franchise after playing the game &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. &lt;/em&gt;First, I&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;decided to go back and revisit the first two games in the trilogy. Then I decided to read the books to see what the games were based on. So when I heard that Netflix was going to make a TV show based on the novels, I was very interested — and the fact that Henry Cavill would play Geralt of Rivia put me totally on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0FmPL"&gt;The first season aired roughly a year ago, and I really liked it. I am not going to claim the show is better than &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;because that is an unfair comparison. And I will warn you that the first season warrants a second watch because the story, which shuffles timelines, can get a bit confusing. Nevertheless, if you love fantasy TV shows and liked &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; novels and / or the games, the TV show is worth a watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t8wyYL"&gt;The Prom&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Prom" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qd0-vHtedRs3CAoCpH_84XbhGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175284/201211_the_prom_netflix_ew_305p_1b7b20b1bc6468f75bbba783f3514f59.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IFZ6Dn"&gt;A movie adaption based on the 2018 Broadway musical of the same name, &lt;em&gt;The Prom&lt;/em&gt; follows a group of Broadway actors who travel to a small Indiana town to aid a lesbian student who was banned from going to her high school prom with her girlfriend. The movie is extremely vibrant with a ton of bright colors and glitter and energetic songs. While the story itself seems a bit disjointed, the acting and songs kept me entertained throughout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GPvXqN"&gt;The Big Flower Fight&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Big Flower Fight" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6ng0TEEYXLjZoIMfV1ALQGnZzA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170691/2667eccb11dbfdc6b381927704f6d56374_big_flower_fight_lede.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Big Flower Fight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BFyFE4"&gt;What happens when you take &lt;em&gt;The Great British Bake Off&lt;/em&gt; and switch cooking with floral design? You get &lt;em&gt;The Big Flower Fight&lt;/em&gt;, of course. This oddly satisfying reality competition pits artists, florists, and landscapers against each other as they try to build giant sculptures out of plants. I like watching cooking competitions like &lt;em&gt;MasterChef, &lt;/em&gt;and I was won over by the idea of a competition to make beautiful sculptures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aLDU0C"&gt;The Crown&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Crown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNuSiPPV53RoyPgkq1e2w90mSLI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175292/TheCrown_406_Unit_02045.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WWoCUH"&gt;As a history buff, I am overly critical whenever I watch movies or TV shows inspired by historical events. While &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt; takes a lot of liberties with what actually happened during Queen Elizabeth II’s reign, I can’t stop watching this show. To be honest, I am not following it because of its historical accuracy, but because of the incredible cinematography and superb acting from the cast members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2XM94q"&gt;Unsolved Mysteries &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Unsolved Mysteries" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhX5RHisJQihuorWJV3VzZ8GMZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170702/netflix_unsolved_mysteries.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zcjiJu"&gt;I grew up watching a bunch of crime-focused shows like &lt;em&gt;Snapped&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;. They would keep me up all night while I played detective — and now, as an adult, I keep coming back to them. Originally a series released on NBC in the late 1980s, &lt;em&gt;Unsolved Mysteries&lt;/em&gt; has breathed new life to a well-loved trope on the streaming giant’s platform. The 2020 reboot spans six episodes, with each episode focusing on a different cold case. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Book of Boba Fett is another Mandalorian spinoff show, coming to Disney Plus in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IhT0jhcdDUAYgJuEre9NK635QmQ=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547049/boba_fett.6.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8uu4li"&gt;After years of speculation about whether Boba Fett would get his own spinoff of some kind, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s season 2 finale confirmed that a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542557/the-mandalorian-season-2-premiere-review-disney-plus"&gt;Boba Fett series&lt;/a&gt;, titled &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, will hit Disney Plus in December 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hP6qXF"&gt;Executive producer Jon Favreau appeared on &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America &lt;/em&gt;on December 21st to confirm &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1341013938570371072"&gt;as a new series&lt;/a&gt; (following some speculation that &lt;em&gt;Book of Boba Fett &lt;/em&gt;was some sort of subtitle for&lt;em&gt; The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s third season.) The new show will be an original series set within the world of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian, &lt;/em&gt;with Favreau, Dave Filoni, and Robert Rodriguez set to produce the series. Favreau and Filoni already produce &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, while Rodriguez directed the Boba Fett-centric season two episode, “The Tragedy.” Production on &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s third season will take place right after &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fRJiHm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarWars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StarWars&lt;/a&gt; clarification: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheBookOfBobaFett?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheBookOfBobaFett&lt;/a&gt; is coming next December. It will not run alongside season 3 of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheMandalorian?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheMandalorian&lt;/a&gt;. As Favreau says here, Mando Season 3 will go start production after next year’s Boba Fett show. &lt;a href="https://t.co/8cKF15dw7g"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8cKF15dw7g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Erik Davis (@ErikDavis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ErikDavis/status/1341016663685251079?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jZNuMg"&gt;The show was not included as an announcement during Disney’s big investor day last week. Several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;other &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; projects&lt;/a&gt;, including two other &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;spinoffs — an Ahsoka Tano show and &lt;em&gt;Rangers of the New Republic &lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a Lando Calrissian show, and a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;anime series, were announced then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joYKx4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: The following contains light spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s second season finale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhCn1x"&gt;The announcement comes during a post-credits scene (ah, yes, the post-credits scenes), which finds Boba Fett and Fennec Shand in Jabba the Hutt’s palace. Fans will recall this is where Boba Fett was thrown into the sarlacc pit a few years before. Now, Boba Fett is back — and after blasting away Bib Fortuna, the pasty-faced employee of Jabba the Hutt who gave me nightmares as a child — Boba Fett takes his place on Jabba’s throne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY900i"&gt;Wild! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVD4mi"&gt;The scene announcing the spinoff series will come as a nice surprise for anyone who held out hope for a Boba Fett movie years ago when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13926062/star-wars-rogue-one-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/15/17355964/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-ron-howard"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were being released. Now, there’s a TV show instead. It’s a smart move for Disney and Lucasfilm. A series is less of a risk than a movie, and it helps keep customers subscribed to the platform. Plus, tying everything together is a pretty good way to get people to stay on Disney Plus to watch other shows when they’re done with the most recent &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episode; it’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21761493/mandalorian-star-wars-clone-rebels-dave-filoni-ahsoka-tano-thrawn"&gt;happening with &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftZeup"&gt;While this season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is over, it’s clear that fans have a ton of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to look forward to in 2021. Can there be too much &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;? Former CEO Bob Iger certainly thought &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fatigue &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/disney-ceo-bob-iger-star-wars-solo-flop-1202175861/"&gt;took over at the box office&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe Disney Plus is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb11rR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (December 21st, 8:40am ET): &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story has been updated to include new information about the series. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Lf2YvN"&gt;
&lt;aside id="jGdErq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus","description":"$6.99 per month or $69.99 if you pay annually","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ latest concept phone is a color-changing, motion-tracking 8T</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nz4-PTKNiDdlKz0wEBhTm8ajUE0=/0x0:1152x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559400/8T_concept_KV_16_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="64mOXd"&gt;OnePlus has a new concept phone to show off, which is its way of teasing tech that maybe, just maybe, might make it into one of the company’s future phones. The OnePlus 8T Concept is a similar phone to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;OnePlus 8T&lt;/a&gt; that was released a couple months ago, but it’s got a pretty unique rear design that changes color alongside a motion-tracking radar module. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVK4kt"&gt;According to OnePlus, this color-changing effect is achieved with a film that contains metal oxide, which sits underneath the phone’s glass back and changes color as different voltages are applied to it. At its most basic, it could change color to show off the phone’s notifications, like an incoming phone call, much like the notification light that it has included on its phones in the past. But where things get really interesting is when it gets paired with the concept phone’s rear-mounted radar module. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TW8rbfniTUvqYO-DHpbh0XYNs7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22182956/8T_Concept.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus shows how the design on the rear of the phone can change color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vryG0g"&gt;This module, which is built into the camera bump on the back of the phone, uses millimeter wave radar to bounce electromagnetic waves off its surroundings and lets the phone “perceive, image, locate, and track objects.” Although OnePlus says this mmWave technology is “borrowed from 5G,” it adds that the radar module is separate from any mmWave communication module in the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TW9zE4"&gt;Functionally, it sounds similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt;’s radar-enabled Motion Sense technology, which let you swipe your hand above the phone to skip music tracks or silence alarms. It could also detect your presence to show you the time and any notifications. The functionality was interesting, but Google hasn’t included it in subsequent phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rud7Oh"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="ECMF Notifications|99927" data-volume-uuid="03ae584ba" data-volume-id="99927" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-101" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Qnez1"&gt;This concept phone can also use this motion tracker to do simple things like answering a phone call with a gesture, or offer more advanced functionality like sensing a user’s breathing. This can be combined with its color-changing back to offer some interesting use cases. For example, its back could change color to indicate an incoming call, and then you could accept or reject it with a gesture, without having to touch the phone itself. Or the radar could sense your breathing, and then change its back’s color in time with it, “effectively making the phone a biofeedback device,” OnePlus says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj0KEa"&gt;It’s an ambitious collection of features, but there’s no guarantee we’ll ever see them come to a consumer device. After all, a little under a year ago OnePlus was showing off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054391/oneplus-concept-one-mclaren-disappearing-phone-camera-hands-on"&gt;OnePlus Concept One&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting device which used electrochromic glass to make its rear cameras disappear (and which also acted as a pretty neat little &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral-density_filter"&gt;ND filter&lt;/a&gt;). However, the technology is yet to make an appearance in any of the company’s flagship phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="87u3Dq"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="ECMF Breathing|99928" data-volume-uuid="261d90825" data-volume-id="99928" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-970" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mUixth"&gt;As with the Concept One before it, OnePlus says it has no plans to commercially sell the OnePlus 8T Concept, so it’s best thought of as a small showcase of what the company is working on. But with any luck, the technology could yet come to one of its real smartphones one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBTYhj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe releases Apple Silicon version of Premiere Pro in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1pSOOnlCu8CTFOf7nfR1F0j2pY=/0x0:749x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559369/PPro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r6qYc8"&gt;Adobe has released an Arm version of Premiere Pro for macOS, allowing owners of new Apple Silicon M1 Macs to run the video editing software natively. The program is still very much in beta for now, however, and the &lt;a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-beta/discuss-premiere-pro-on-apple-silicon-m1/td-p/11691346?page=1"&gt;Adobe post announcing its availability&lt;/a&gt; lists a host of known bugs and missing features. News of its release was &lt;a href="https://the8-bit.com/adobe-premiere-pro-for-m1-macs-now-available-to-public-beta-testers/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The 8-Bit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/premiere-pro-premiere-rush-audition-for-m1-beta/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; adds&lt;/a&gt; that Adobe’s Premiere Rush and Audition have also been updated to run on the new machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkSxYy"&gt;Adobe says it’s porting Premiere Pro’s features over in phases, starting with its core editing functions and workflows, as well as popular codecs like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes. Third-party integrations will need to be updated by their respective developers to work on Apple Silicon. Adobe advises that users can run the current release version of Premiere Pro on M1 Macs using Rosetta 2 emulation while the Arm version is still in development, though some third-party integrations may not work in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaQRE2"&gt;Premiere Pro joins other Adobe apps including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571070/adobe-photoshop-arm64-beta-windows-macos-m1"&gt;Lightroom&lt;/a&gt; that have seen releases for Apple’s new Arm-based Macs. It’s a relatively quick turnaround for Adobe considering the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini were only released just over a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dozens of Al Jazeera journalists targeted in apparent iOS spyware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbJr-LdQ9t6mMic2yNHFwEeQFas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559162/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QGHkvY"&gt;36 personal phones belonging to Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors, and executives were hacked in a spyware campaign between July and August 2020, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/"&gt;a new report from Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; alleges. The attacks reportedly used Pegasus technology provided by the Israeli firm NSO Group, and are thought to be the work of four operators. Citizen Lab says it has “medium confidence” that one is working on behalf of the UAE government and another for the Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1mZNr"&gt;The attacks are worrying not just because they appear to show politically-motivated targeting of journalists, but also because they’re part of a trend of using increasingly advanced methods that are harder to detect. According to Citizen Lab, the attacks seem to have used a zero-click exploit to compromise iPhones via iMessage, meaning the attacks happened without the victims needing to do anything, and leave much less of a trace once a device is infected. In July 2020, the exploit chain was a zero-day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b4U0XN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14 is not thought to be vulnerable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl91yS"&gt;Citizen Lab’s report says “almost all iPhone devices” which haven’t been updated to iOS 14 appear to be vulnerable to the hack, meaning the infections it found are likely to be a “miniscule fraction” of the total number. It has disclosed its findings to Apple, and the company is looking into the issue. Citizen Lab’s analysis suggests the spyware can record audio from a phone (including ambient noise and audio from phone calls), take photos, track location, and access passwords. Devices updated to iOS 14 don’t appear to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUvkiT"&gt;Citizen Lab discovered one of the hacks after Al Jazeera journalist, Tamer Almisshal, allowed the organization to install a VPN on his device because he was worried it might have been compromised. Using this software, Citizen Lab, noticed that his phone visited a suspected installation server for NSO Group’s spyware. Seconds later, his phone uploaded over 200MB of data to three IP addresses for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwYgD5"&gt;As well as the Al Jazeera employees, Citizen Lab reports that a journalist with Al Araby TV, Rania Dridi, was also the victim of hacks using NSO Group’s spyware. These attacks date back to October 2019, and appear to include two zero-day exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0MCsi"&gt;This is not the first time allegations have emerged that spyware from NSO Group has been used to target journalists. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/20/citizen-lab-nso-dozens-of-aljazeera-journalists-allegedly-hacked-using-israeli-firm-spyware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the software has allegedly been used to target journalists in Morocco, as well as political dissidents from Rwanda and Spanish politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ewhJZ"&gt;When contacted for comment a spokesperson for NSO Group told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Citizen Lab’s report was based on “speculation” and “lacks any evidence supporting a connection to NSO.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJTXOs"&gt;“NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, and as stated in the past we do not operate them,” the spokesperson said. “However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse with enough information which can enable us to assess such credibility, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our investigation procedure in order to review the allegations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhDZmC"&gt;As a result of its investigation, Citizen Lab is calling for more regulations over the use of surveillance technology, and for a global moratorium on its sale and transfer until safeguards are put in place to guard against its misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oG4ZqKZXbNTE6IF6MrurOOYVBDE=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68559011/DSCF7475.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 5G is a better phone if you don’t care about selfies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DHBPJf"&gt;In a perfect world, everything would fit under the surface of smartphone displays. That’s been the principle behind the past few years of phone design, at least, ever since the iPhone X escalated the bezel wars with its conspicuous notch. From in-display fingerprint sensors to pop-up selfie cameras, we’ve seen phone manufacturers take creative approaches to achieving the highest possible screen-to-body ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blwqBj"&gt;The latest advancement in the bezel wars is the ZTE Axon 20 5G, which goes on sale today and is the world’s first phone to integrate its front-facing camera underneath the screen. While in-display fingerprint sensors are commonplace now, doing the same for selfie cameras has proven to be more difficult. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt; have been showing off demos for years, but ZTE has beaten them to the punch with the first commercial device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUjZn6"&gt;In theory, the advantages are obvious. You get an unbroken display that doesn’t need to account for a notch or hole-punch, and you don’t have to build in a motorized mechanism for a pop-up camera module. Again, if the world were perfect, the camera would just magically exist under the display without compromising image quality on either end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBqPrU"&gt;Readers, the world is not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/65plfj17NdcpU5n3L8Fy7TbzGCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185694/DSCF7476.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SiU2sa"&gt;Before we talk about the camera, we should talk about the display that lies on top. I doubt this has anything to do with the camera technology itself, but the fact is that the Axon 20 5G is one of the biggest smartphones I’ve ever seen. The 90Hz OLED panel is a massive 6.92 inches diagonal, which means its 1080p resolution is a little less sharp than you’ll find on other phones. It’s not a problem in regular use, though, and the screen generally looks pretty good beyond some rough off-angle color shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S1VWaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It sometimes looks worse than a notch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AwiFjW"&gt;What does not look good is the comparatively huge “chin” bezel at the bottom. Even though it would have been considered extraordinarily slim just a few years ago, it really stands out on the Axon 20 5G considering the supposedly breakthrough nature of the device. I’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715232/meizu-16s-hands-on-price-specs-design"&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt; that have managed to integrate conventional selfie cameras into thinner bezels than this, which kind of undermines the point of putting one under the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB7cfA"&gt;That feeling only intensifies when you go through the Axon 20 5G’s setup process, which  shows the camera in the worst possible conditions. The under-display integration is extremely noticeable on light backgrounds, like what you tend to see on settings screens. There’s a square patch of the screen that exhibits a clear dithering effect, making it appear much lower resolution than the rest of the panel. I will just say right now that I think it looks worse than a notch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eWiNB"&gt;In more general use, it’s harder to notice. If you’re viewing photos or a full-color wallpaper, you can see the lower-resolution area if you look closely, but it isn’t quite as distracting. And as with other companies who’ve shipped Android phones with notches or hole-punches, ZTE’s default software uses a black background for the top part of the screen where status and notification icons are displayed, which does make the camera near-invisible. But really, if you need to resort to the same old notch-hiding techniques to disguise your under-display camera, what are we even doing here?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ny8TgkEmYfp4JvywJeSlQxmLx8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185690/DSCF7470.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rXDOyId2Gufsvk43likwoVILZtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185691/DSCF7468.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5NbEO_pIxn41JwM22cLzctw-30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22185692/DSCF7472.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hUeGt6"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The above images show how visible the camera is on colorful, white, and black backgrounds.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AFfALE"&gt;Of course, the next obvious question is how the camera actually performs. The news here is not great either. I don’t want to diminish the technical achievement of getting a halfway functional camera under an OLED screen at all — it involves new types of transparent materials, pixel filters, and demosaicing algorithms to make sense of the light that hits the 32-megapixel sensor. But the result, unfortunately, is a bad selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf3Opi"&gt;In good light, the Axon 20 5G’s selfie camera takes hazy, soft photos with weak colors and blown-out highlights. Compare it to the Pixel 5 below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lUrEbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10243932"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z8cxn"&gt;Just to be clear, that Axon 20 5G photo was taken with the portrait mode and smoothing filters turned &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RfPxRt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10243988"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXgJn2"&gt;The disparity is just as stark in low light, with a ton of noise and obliterated detail. I turned off the Pixel 5’s night mode here to make it more of a fair fight, and it still crushed the Axon 20 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y31v2m"&gt;This under-display selfie camera is merely functional, and that’s being generous. It can capture images through the screen, yes, which is indeed a minor miracle. But you probably wouldn’t want anyone else to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BYaOmL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is otherwise a pretty credible phone for $449&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r6q6SX"&gt;This isn’t the most effusive compliment I can give a phone with a supposedly breakthrough selfie camera, but the ZTE Axon 20 5G is actually a much better proposition if you don’t care about selfies or video calls. It’s otherwise a pretty credible phone for $449, though despite providing a dollar price ZTE says it won’t be available in the US or Canada for now. (&lt;a href="https://events.ztedevices.com/zte-subscription-page"&gt;It’s €449 in the EU and £419 in the UK.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px9VQC"&gt;While the Axon 20 5G has a huge footprint, it’s still slim at just under 8mm thick, and ZTE has included a reasonably large 4,220mAh battery inside. The processor is a Snapdragon 765G with an integrated 5G modem, same as the Pixel 5 and the LG Velvet, and it can be configured to have up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeKuUA"&gt;Other specs include an optical in-display fingerprint sensor that works fine, 30W fast charging over USB-C, and a headphone jack. There’s a 64-megapixel main camera and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, along with 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors that you can probably ignore. The main areas where ZTE has cut corners are its mediocre haptics system and an unimpressive downward-firing speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oN1L1Y"&gt;The fact that ZTE finally got a phone like this onto the market is a notable milestone, but I’m not sure who the device is really for. The under-display selfie camera often looks worse and more distracting than a notch, and the image quality is clearly compromised. It’s ironic that a phone might be more appealing to an audience that actively doesn’t care about its key selling point, but that’s where we’re at with the Axon 20 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t55DGF"&gt;I can barely go anywhere on the internet without seeing yet another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1339286036745232391"&gt;wild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kgwqxa/just_another_lovely_morning_in_night_city/"&gt;hilarious&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VaultofKvlt/status/1337591912853749760"&gt;downright odd bug&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a buggy game, and developer CD Projekt Red has already released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; to try and shore up some of the problems. One issue that’s starting to pop up, though, isn’t funny at all: some players are reporting that their &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; save files are becoming corrupted if they exceed a certain file size (&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amp/2020-12-20-gog-advises-cyberpunk-2077-players-to-keep-a-lower-amount-of-items-to-avoid-corrupting-save-files"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jxaz2F"&gt;If your &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; save is corrupted, you’ll apparently see this prompt when you try and load up the game: “saved data is damaged and cannot be loaded.” Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N61B7oNUEuK25mGcSo5lOHxbKPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22186789/Save_damaged.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The prompt shown for corrupted saves in &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WWd4yz"&gt;While it’s not clear what might be causing save files to be corrupted, it seems it can happen when the saves reach 8MB in size. Crossing that 8MB threshold is when the save file corrupted for one Redditor, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kfpwt5/psa_steampc_crossing_about_6_mb_in_your_save/"&gt;in their testing&lt;/a&gt;. There are also multiple people on CD Projekt Red’s forums &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/post-12416147"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/post-12418382"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/post-12421034"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; 8MB+ save files are corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGZURA"&gt;In a GOG.com support document about the corrupted saves prompt, &lt;a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016743298-Cyberpunk-2077-Saved-data-is-damaged-and-cannot-be-loaded-?product=gog&amp;amp;pp=d965a463ac183af4828302b14522bb3371cec49f"&gt;CD Projekt Red says that&lt;/a&gt; “unfortunately the save is damaged and can’t be recovered.” To avoid seeing the prompt, the company recommends using an older save and to “keep a lower amount of items and crafting materials.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAVd2i"&gt;Theoretically, if your &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; save file is larger than 8MB, you’ve invested dozens of hours into the game and collected a lot of items. If I had a corrupted save in part because I picked up too much stuff (in a game that’s &lt;em&gt;littered&lt;/em&gt; with stuff to pick up), I know I’d be extremely disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmlN56"&gt;CD Projekt Red says in the save file size limit “might be increased in one of the future patches” &lt;a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016743298-Cyberpunk-2077-Saved-data-is-damaged-and-cannot-be-loaded-?product=gog&amp;amp;pp=d965a463ac183af4828302b14522bb3371cec49f"&gt;in the GOG.com support document&lt;/a&gt;. But even if that increase happens, the save files that are currently corrupted will remain so, the document says. If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; experiencing corrupted saves, a moderator on CD Projekt Red’s &lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/save-files-are-corrupted.11052596/"&gt;official &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; forums&lt;/a&gt; has offered some suggestions on how to load backup saves that you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzKsB6"&gt;The studio &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472/photo/1"&gt;has promised&lt;/a&gt; to release two large patches for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; next year: one in January and one in February. Perhaps the company will make changes in those patches to help prevent files from becoming corrupted. CD Projekt Red didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Bridgerton, Palmer, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fZShpCHvIFY6ai3whgaN086rHDM=/231x72:1634x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68557464/Screen_Shot_2020_12_20_at_1.34.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRK60L"&gt;Hi, I’m Jay! I’m subbing in for your usual trailers guide Kim Lyons while she takes a well-deserved holiday break. I’ve really been looking forward to writing this post. Trailers are fun! They’re like bite-sized movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KY1ma"&gt;Unfortunately, there weren’t a ton of trailers to choose from this week. I suppose studios don’t want to launch big trailers for upcoming blockbusters shortly before everyone takes off for the holidays. But there were still a few good ones to watch, including a trailer for a series launching on Netflix later this week. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="icRUIG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpv7ayf_tyE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q9TbTN"&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XCvNbh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; is Shona Rhimes’ upcoming British period drama for Netflix, the first series resulting from her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142342/shonda-rhimes-deal-netflix-greys-anatomy-scandal"&gt;mega-deal with Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like it should hit a lot of the expected high points from a period drama, such as a budding relationship between two people of high society, lots of witty one-liners, and extravagant settings, dancing, and costumes. And I’m sure Rhimes’ influence will make the show all the more exciting. &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; will be released on Netflix on December 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BExhw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8jVuOheTNGQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j6RMOS"&gt;Palmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JafKlA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palmer&lt;/em&gt; stars Justin Timberlake as a man trying to rebuild his life after being in prison. Soon after he returns home, he begins taking care of a small boy, Sam, whose mother has disappeared. The movie looks like it will focus on how the two help each other overcome their difficulties. The movie will be released on January 29th on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LfOlfO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sxCFZ8_d84?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bCBwY0"&gt;Nomadland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5yYPf8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is about a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who hits the road in her van and becomes a nomad. It’s the third movie directed by Chloé Zhao, who also directed &lt;em&gt;Songs My Brothers Taught Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Rider. &lt;/em&gt;The trailer is beautiful and contemplative — the movie feels like it will be perfect for a quiet night curled up in a blanket. &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; is set for a US theatrical release on February 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v1SxkE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwYhA5YvdNc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BtmiMn"&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fMhc1x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire’s&lt;/em&gt; trailer has lots of athletic jumps, explosions, robots, and loud drumming, so I hope that translates to a fun and campy action movie. (Basically, it seems like the opposite of &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt;.) And Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix/81074110"&gt;official description for the movie&lt;/a&gt; makes me even more intrigued: “Set in the future, Harp (Damson Idris), a drone pilot, is sent into a deadly militarized zone where he finds himself working for Leo (Anthony Mackie), an android officer, tasked to locate a doomsday device before the insurgents do.” Sweet, I’m in. &lt;em&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/em&gt; will hit Netflix on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OFICxT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SntsSsMLUWA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3cHU9z"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dir6hL"&gt;Disney has also released another short trailer for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming Disney Plus series from Marvel Studios. Elizabeth Olsen stars as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany as Vision. If you’ve been anticipating &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t have to wait long until you can finally watch it — the show premieres on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI7aQo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFmMCq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNLx7C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wM7igq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jsXF6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Frontline essential workers and the elderly next in line for COVID-19 vaccinations in US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2R5rpw52NVzbzu-7Taa43jtzQFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68557248/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmUTyq"&gt;Frontline essential workers and people 75 years of age and older in the United States should get COVID-19 vaccines in the next wave of immunizations, an independent committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended. That group includes about 49 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3V5XoR"&gt;After those groups are vaccinated, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) said doses should go to people between 65 and 74 years old, people between 16 and 65 years old with underlying health conditions, and other essential workers not in groups considered frontline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi7toz"&gt;Vaccines will be in limited supply through at least the next few months. The CDC expects that there should be doses available to vaccinate 20 million people in December, 30 million people in January, and 50 million people in February. “In this setting, difficult choices have to be made,” Kathleen Dooling, medical officer at the CDC, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-20/02-COVID-Dooling.pdf"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; to the ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCOvt"&gt;States and local jurisdictions ultimately make the final decisions around the distribution and prioritization of vaccinations, but the CDC recommendations help shape their approaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBsUq8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;first phase&lt;/a&gt; of vaccinations are going to health care workers and long term care facility residents. Those groups started to get vaccinated last week, and over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html"&gt;500,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US have been vaccinated so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppZVEK"&gt;The ACIP balanced two main goals to make recommendations for the second wave of vaccinations: preventing death and disease and preserving societal function. Older adults over 75 have the highest risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Frontline essential workers — which the committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-20/02-COVID-Dooling.pdf"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; includes firefighters, teachers, grocery store workers, manufacturing workers, and others — are unable to work from home and often have to interact with the public, putting them at risk of exposure to the virus. Keeping those groups healthy will help keep key services running. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GueTN6lQyz7VpYyAUB-saqQHXYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22186150/EpsZq7oW4AEMBMj.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;CDC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Slide from a presentation on vaccine prioritization. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SGOWqO"&gt;“This approach mitigates health inequities as racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in many essential industries,” Dooling said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4ID0g"&gt;The third group the committee says should be vaccinated includes essential workers like people working in food service, construction, transportation, wastewater, and media. People between 65 and 74 are also at high risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19, as are younger people with underlying health conditions like cardiac disease or diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezxMHV"&gt;While the CDC has a list of workplaces that it considers frontline and essential, different states will set those designations in different ways. Various interest groups are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/nyregion/essential-worker-coronavirus-vaccine.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;lobbying &lt;/a&gt;states to include their workers in early vaccination groups — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167583/uber-driver-early-access-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, for example, asked states to prioritize its drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vd2VGy"&gt;Distributing vaccines to the second and third wave of priority groups will be difficult. It’s hard to determine eligibility, for example, and reaching essential workers (who may not be able to take time off of work, or may live in rural areas) is a challenge. Committee members stressed the importance of adequate funding for vaccine distribution. Money was funneled into vaccine development, which led to the overwhelmingly effective final products. Local health departments need the same level of investment in vaccination programs. The vaccines are Cadillacs, Jeffrey Duchin, a health officer in King County, Washington, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1340702874775531525"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting. “But they’ve come with empty gas tanks,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKWqxf"&gt;Over 200,000 people are being diagnosed with COVID-19 in the US each day, and over 2,500 people are dying from the disease every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuUKQ9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ninja’s Fall Guys skin is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yurYvFQcTgRisOLeEBajLNaHAC8=/428x0:2732x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68556947/EpmxqCKXEAEN0h1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ninja Fall Guys skin.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mediatonic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z8X1qY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; developer Mediatonic has added a skin based on the hugely-popular streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins to the game. The skin’s arrival follows a two-week charity bidding war &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21404149/fall-guys-twitter-bidding-war-in-game-costume-charity"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; to have a custom skin added to the game. Blevins, G2 Esports, Aim Lab, and Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson pledged a combined $1 million to &lt;a href="https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/"&gt;Special Effect&lt;/a&gt;, which helps people with physical disabilities find ways to play video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eu9LAq"&gt;Here’s a couple photos the Ninja skin in-game, courtesy of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1340626462987210753"&gt;the Fall Guys Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. It looks kind of like a jelly bean-sized version of the Ninja skin that was added to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
