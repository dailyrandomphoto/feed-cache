    <title>The grid needs to smarten up to reach clean energy goals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbovbFQTxn1qY_O64p_fh6zXMCk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273956/acastro_210510_4555_smartGrid_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Smart grids were supposed to come to the rescue a long time ago&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jyKEUO"&gt;In the future, our vehicles and homes will be in constant conversation with the power grid. Smart thermostats will send information about how much energy the home is using or potentially wasting to heat or cool itself. Solar panels will say how much energy they have on hand, while electric vehicles will share information about when and where they’re charging and how much juice they need for their travels. Solar and EV batteries might even offer up the energy they’re storing in case it’s needed elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcseeR"&gt;“You just plug it in, and somehow it automatically talks to its nearest neighbors,” explains Ben Kroposki, a director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “[It] says, ‘Hey, I just want to let you know I’m out here. I can provide these kinds of services back.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="COZRpl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a6P4n1"&gt;That conversation is the backbone of what’s called a “smart grid.” While America’s aging grid system was built to send electricity in one direction — from power plants to homes and businesses — smart grids are a two-way street. Homes and buildings send information and electricity back to the grid or to other homes and buildings. An electric vehicle battery, for example, might be able to provide power to an area in the middle of a blackout. A smart grid also listens for directions from the utility, so that it charges whenever solar or other renewable energy is most abundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i0kPH"&gt;It’s a simple enough idea that for more than a decade has been sold as a way to improve the efficiency, environmental impact, and resiliency of the power sector. But electricity grids still have a long way to go to get “smart.” They’ve managed to fail spectacularly under the stressors of climate change and more extreme weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZhxBQ"&gt;After years of underinvestment, there’s renewed hope that long-awaited smart grids might actually come to fruition. President Joe Biden can’t reach his goal of getting the power sector to run on 100 percent clean energy by 2035 without a smarter grid. And grids can’t get smarter without the kind of urgency that Biden has injected into overhauling America’s infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQi33I"&gt;“This probably is the most exciting time in the power system history in the last 50 years,” Kroposki says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZAyprD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A smarter grid can better manage power demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VNn9QR"&gt;While Biden’s clean energy goals are vital for staving off a deeper climate crisis, the plan has exposed some weaknesses in our current grid system that a smart grid could help solve. For starters, old grids were built to accommodate a constant flow of electricity; power plants can ramp generation up and down at will to deliver as much energy as people demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LStV9M"&gt;Wind and solar power aren’t so consistent. When it’s sunny and gusty, too much energy might overwhelm the grid, leading to some of it going to waste. There also isn’t enough energy storage — aka batteries — to hold onto that excess renewable energy so that it can be used when sunshine and wind die down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TENvs"&gt;A smarter grid can better manage power demand, making use of renewable energy when it’s most abundant and preventing energy shortages. Embattled California utility PG&amp;amp;E, which has come under scrutiny for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908434/california-blackouts-utilities-fires-lawsuits-san-francisco-bay-area-pge-pacific-gas-electric"&gt;pervasive rolling blackouts&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352090/bmw-pge-ev-california-vehicle-grid-charging"&gt;has partnered with BMW&lt;/a&gt; to implement “smart charging” for its electric vehicles. Their pilot “smart charging” program incentivizes EV drivers to charge their cars whenever there’s excess renewable energy, typically in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSolmF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That revolution is gaining momentum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aY7tq3"&gt;That kind of coordination can also prevent blackouts by taking pressure off the grid when there’s peak demand, typically when people come home from work in the evening or crank up their air conditioners in the summertime. Managing that demand will become even more important in the race to electrify homes, buildings, and transportation so that they can run on renewable energy. Some cities have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;banned new gas hookups&lt;/a&gt; in favor of electricity, and California &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles starting in 2035. Electricity grids will have to brace themselves for all those changes. “We’re going to need to speed up the pace of the grid investments in order to keep up with everything that’s happening outside the grid,” says Karen Wayland, CEO of the GridWise Alliance whose members include utilities, tech, and energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVNvG3"&gt;A flood of new electric vehicles could overwhelm old, creaky grids. But EV batteries could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451642/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-energy-grid-battery-day-elon-musk"&gt;become an asset&lt;/a&gt; in an updated, smarter grid. The same is true for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403271/virtual-power-plants-california-apartment-buildings-solar-energy"&gt;residential solar power&lt;/a&gt; systems with batteries. They might &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523976/virtual-power-plants-solar-energy-grid-resilience-climate-change"&gt;provide backup power&lt;/a&gt; when extreme weather causes problems, like when a storm forces a power plant offline or when a heatwave drives up power demand for air conditioning. But to be able to do that, utilities need to build out a way to communicate with those batteries so that they know when they’re available and how much capacity they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtBzSU"&gt;In the middle of an outage, a smart grid can also sense excess power being wasted. It might have been able to divert power from empty downtown Houston skyscrapers to people facing freezing temperatures inside their homes during the Texas freeze earlier this year. “In laser, scalpel-like precision, you can turn the building lights off or down … and avoid having to do the rolling blackouts by being able to connect in real time to those assets,” Michael Bates, global general manager of energy at Intel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SIDvru"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Powering a real city with a virtual power plant|95786" data-volume-uuid="e9cbe1c6a" data-volume-id="95786" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-856" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V28461"&gt;Seeing the potential of smarter grids, the Obama administration funneled $11 billion toward developing smart grids and the reduction of power outages. But the money wasn’t enough. Outages have been &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/01/power-outages-like-the-one-in-texas-are-becoming-more-common-in-america"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; since 2009, when Biden announced the investment as part of an economic stimulus package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmSDlW"&gt;Obama’s initial investments spurred the adoption of smart meters in the US, which can tell utilities how much energy a household is using at regular intervals. (Before that, utility workers had to come and read the meters). The future will be more granular; utilities may be able to read how much energy each appliance in your home is using. That initial funding was only a drop in the bucket in terms of what’s needed to unlock the full potential of smart grids. A &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-utilities-smartgrid-epri/u-s-smart-grid-to-cost-billions-save-trillions-idUSTRE74N7O420110524"&gt;2011 report&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="https://www.epri.com/research/products/1022519"&gt;Electric Power Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; estimated that it would cost up to $476 billion over 20 years to fully modernize the grid. To make things harder, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/465001-trump-officials-eliminate-board-that-advised-on-smart-grid"&gt;dismantled&lt;/a&gt; a smart grid advisory board that Obama had started and took other actions to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/how-trump-appointees-short-circuited-grid-modernization/615433/"&gt;kneecap grid modernization research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZza4D"&gt;Similarly, Obama set the US on course to slash greenhouse gas emissions — but not with the same urgency we’re now seeing under the Biden administration. That’s in part because so much time has been wasted, and the climate crisis has only grown more destructive and exacerbated by disasters that batter energy grids. “The utilities and the markets still felt like it was more of an evolution,” Bates tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think everyone’s now starting to see this more as a revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MZ4A2U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Increasing cyber threats” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ETPOaz"&gt;That revolution is gaining momentum. A new &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/27/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-expansion-modernization-of-the-electric-grid/"&gt;advisory council&lt;/a&gt; formed last week to push for funding to modernize the power sector. Representatives from labor and environmental groups, utilities, and tech companies are all part of the council calling for a $50 billion investment. That would go toward making sure every household has a smart meter, plus installing sensors, controls, and other equipment across the grid to analyze and respond to energy supply and demand. There’s also a need for a better communications infrastructure for utilities — either through fiber optic or wireless networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ueiXx"&gt;The council is also backing Biden’s sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which proposes laying down new high-voltage transmission lines to make more resilient grids.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02K39f"&gt;Beyond garnering the money and political will necessary to really get the ball rolling on modernizing the grid, there are more technical details to hammer out. Keeping an increasingly digital power system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429433/colonial-pipeline-cyber-security-ransomware-attack"&gt;safe from hackers&lt;/a&gt; is one of them. So Wayland’s group is calling for $1 billion in funding for the Department of Energy to deploy cybersecurity technologies, and another billion to split between monitoring cyber threats and developing a cybersecurity workforce for the energy sector. In April, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-takes-bold-action-protect-electricity-operations-increasing-cyber-0"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a 100-day action plan to safeguard utilities’ control systems from “increasing cyber threats.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fU82c3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Things will probably continue to get more complex in the race to “get smart”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9WtstT"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277300/florida-water-treatment-chemical-tamper-teamviewer-shared-password"&gt;security breach at a water treatment plant&lt;/a&gt; in Florida in February is one example of how vulnerable utilities can become. In that case, hackers tried to increase the concentration of a chemical in the water to poisonous levels. The attempt failed because a person working at the plant figured out what was going on and adjusted chemical levels back to safe levels. Safeguards in a smarter grid could prevent a similar attack on the power sector, Wayland says, by blocking any commands that fall outside a predetermined range of operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhJEKj"&gt;Another crucial detail to troubleshoot will be to figure out how electricity rates and energy bills will differ under a smart grid system. To better manage power demand, experts say that smart grids should respond in real time to changing electricity rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtKydt"&gt;Smart grids could one day make suggestions for, or even automate, when people charge their cars or heat their homes. But it has to offer an incentive to get people to agree to do that. The personal payoff is taking advantage of lower electricity rates based on the time of day that you purchase electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Fw0ks"&gt;Right now, most residences pay fixed rates for electricity, which insulates their bills from sudden price changes related to supply and demand. On the other hand, with so-called time-of-use rates (which is more common for heavy industry than for residences), electricity rates can vary by the hour. During the Texas freeze, a similar kind of rate system shocked many homeowners. While people who signed up for that rate system might have saved money by paying wholesale prices throughout the year, some saw their electricity bills &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291426/texas-blackouts-utility-bills-electricity-cost-energy-insecurity"&gt;skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; by thousands of dollars because of fuel shortages. Electricity rates under a smart grid would be similarly variable, so there will need to be protections put in place to ensure that doesn’t happen under a new rate system with smart grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="vwNB8Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCyIfo"&gt;“Now that may only occur once every nine years, but when that occurs you get really upset,” says Henry Lee, director of the Environment and Natural Resources Program at Harvard Kennedy School. “And you run to your elected officials and you run to the regulators to say that they’re ripping me off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i41sln"&gt;That complication illustrates the need for policy changes on top of advances in infrastructure and tech. “You have to build in some safeguards, you know, from that happening,” NREL’s Kroposki says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPVu15"&gt;Things will probably continue to get more complex in the race to “get smart.” After all, what a fully fledged smart grid really looks like is sort of a moving target. The realm of what’s possible will only grow with more technological breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1Y2QiE"&gt;“For me, it’s a portfolio of continually evolving solutions,” says Luis Munuera, an energy technology analyst at the International Energy Agency. “I don’t see so much an endpoint as a process.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A nerdy PS5 chat with Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart’s tech director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0PKjKnUo23wDkiZJiXXUByCOBc=/515x0:3755x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273936/RACRA_Rivet_Molonoth.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Insomniac’s Mike Fitzgerald talks ray tracing, SSDs, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="d6xk0y"&gt;We’re nearly six months into the life of the PlayStation 5, but exclusive games that really showcase the power of the hardware are still relatively rare. That’s part of what made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;last month’s &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so exciting. It’s also a big reason why the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is so highly anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgbGJi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet&lt;/em&gt; has always been an incredible-looking franchise —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22406719/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-state-of-play-sony-insomniac-games-playstation-5"&gt; just look at the 2016 reboot on the PS4&lt;/a&gt;, which was reminiscent of an animated movie — and the latest promises to offer new features only possible on Sony’s new console. It’s still a goofy shooter-platformer filled with weird gadgets, but &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; also features incredibly detailed sci-fi worlds to explore and the titular “rifts” which let players instantly jump into new areas without any loading. (To see some of that in action, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22406719/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-state-of-play-sony-insomniac-games-playstation-5"&gt;check out this recent, lengthy gameplay trailer&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b07xTl"&gt;Ahead of the game’s launch on June 11th, I had a chance to talk to Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at developer Insomniac Games, about the studio’s move into next-gen. He was able to get into the nitty-gritty of working on the console (in addition to &lt;em&gt;Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, Insomniac has also released PS5 versions of two &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; games), including some of the challenges of learning as you go. “This title is the first one where we made the content knowing it would only ever be running on the PlayStation 5,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And so our artists would say ‘What kind of mesh density can I have?’ And I’d be like ‘... I don’t know.’ Because we didn’t have the hardware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrGqqm"&gt;Read on for our full conversation touching on what the team learned from &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;, designing games with ray tracing in mind, why making realistic-looking metallic surfaces is so important, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCKEnQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UPUAb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your first impressions of the PS5 when you finally learned what it was all about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9m4q5I"&gt;We got a briefing before seeing the hardware: “Here’s what’s coming, here’s what our priorities are going to be.” Fortunately, we have a great relationship with them — well, we weren’t a part of PlayStation then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20812656/sony-insomniac-games-acquisition-spider-man-ratchet-clank-developer-playstation"&gt;but now we are&lt;/a&gt; — but we have a close relationship and got to be involved with that stuff pretty early, and that informed the game we were putting together. In that presentation in particular, I think the storage and I/O solutions really stood out to us as something that would be transformative, both in terms of development and the types of games we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8Kjlr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was that initial experience like of working on the&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; games on PS5?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2rr0R"&gt;It was an awesome experience of peeling back layers of that hardware and realizing we need to push our engine side of things more, rather than fighting against the development hardware. The spinning hard drive of the previous gen was always a big constraint for us. Making open-world games on the PS4 is a lot of being very careful with the content you put together, how it’s packaged up, the budgets it fits under, planning ahead of time where you’re going to need to be and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89ucw5"&gt;A lot of those problems just go out the door [on the PS5], which is a big deal. It’s not just the drive itself, but it’s the hardware decompression engine around it, it’s the memory transfers that we leveraged piece by piece, more and more as we went through the project, and realized “Oh, we can make these transitions even faster, we can do them in the middle of a fight.” It was really an evolving process with the console. And it definitely came down to roadblocks in our engine that we needed to pick apart. Some of those basic assumptions of how long it takes data to get off a drive we got to rethink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9pweyrWNaGs-9rM7-ygiviYBsKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507744/RACRA_Megalopolis_Rift_Tether.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GOTWNe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your job a lot of saying “No”? An artist or designer comes to you with an idea, and, particularly on the older hardware, you have to say we just can’t do that. And how does it compare on the PS5?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBtdlm"&gt;Okay, probably not “Nos,” but “Yes, but…” is a common refrain. If an artist wants to accomplish something, or a designer, we try to figure out how to get there. But maybe it’s a point that the compromises are way fewer right now. Of course artists and designers also have a great sense for what the hardware can accomplish, and I think it was challenging ourselves to do new and different things now that the hardware is so different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mal5L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given that this is the first &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; game you’ve worked on, what was your impression of the series? What interested you about working in this universe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fWU9w"&gt;The PS4 title was gorgeous, and I think it’s been really fun to continue that march of progress from a realism perspective. This is what we did with the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; titles, and what a lot of games do. How human can your characters look? How realistic can New York City be? And then apply that same tech, and the rigor behind that tech, to a more fantastical, exaggerated animated aesthetic for the &lt;em&gt;Ratchet&lt;/em&gt; games. That’s been fun. We have realistic materials and lighting, using ray tracing to bring more realism to it. But then we also have an alien whose entire head is an eyeball. The way the silly combines with the realistic I think brings a unique quality to the game that lets it show off the graphical techniques of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz42uh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you talk a bit about how you interact with other departments like art or game design? It sounds like the team is pretty collaborative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4LvZP"&gt;My group is a shared group across multiple titles that we have going at the same time. Different groups within that core technology group have really close relationships with different productions. So we have some audio programmers who work really closely with the audio team, we have animation programmers who work with the animation teams, and so on and so forth. We’re pretty tightly tied in with project schedules. With projects in R&amp;amp;D, we let them be creative; make some mock-ups or concepts that go further than we could ever go in the engine, and then in pre-production, let’s take that and figure out how we can accomplish it and what we can put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGmCnW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when you were working on the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; games, were you filing away ideas for things that would work well with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ratchet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on PS5?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZULMz"&gt;Always filing away ideas. I would even say some stuff that is essential to the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; game turned out to be cool for &lt;em&gt;Ratchet&lt;/em&gt;, and then has some awesome quality effect on that game that we maybe wouldn’t have put in if we’d only been making &lt;em&gt;Ratchet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAC079"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an example?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1x2za"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; is an open-world title. We built all of this tech to stream that open world as you go through it. When you’re downtown, there’s not much Midtown in memory. You can see it from a distance, but then as you go farther north, we pull in those areas. No &lt;em&gt;Ratchet&lt;/em&gt; game has ever been constructed that way. They’ve always been: here’s a level, load the level, now you’re in that level and you play it. But by switching over the &lt;em&gt;Ratchet&lt;/em&gt; world to use that same streaming architecture, we can pack more and more density and content and quality in every corner of a &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; world, because we’re happy to ditch the west side of Nefarious City when you go to the east side, and that type of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dt_dTqQqfXXBjNaBs_4yRXS8JZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507745/RACRA_NefariousCity_Bazaar.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2SNOj1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it make it harder to know when to stop, when you have this ability to cram so much into a game? When you no longer have the same level of technical restrictions, is it harder to say “Alright, this is ready to go”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKYWSl"&gt;Yes, and I would say it’s even difficult to develop the content in the first place to some extent. This title is the first one where we made the content knowing it would only ever be running on the PlayStation 5. And so our artists would say “What kind of mesh density can I have?” And I’d be like “... I don’t know.” Because we didn’t have the hardware. And we didn’t know, as the engine evolved, how the trade-offs would manifest themselves. Even once you have the hardware, it still takes you months or a year for your engine to evolve into it where you know how you want to spend your frame budget, what you do on the GPU versus the CPU, all that kind of stuff. For this game in particular, I would say we kind of just let our artists go wild and make some incredibly detailed objects and models and textures, and then gave ourselves the challenge to make it all run well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgyMoD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obviously ray tracing is a big buzzword right now, but when you’re making a game knowing from the beginning that it’s going to be supported, does that change how you approach things like art or level design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db61xl"&gt;For the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; games, it was a lot of “This looks really cool, this will have a great effect on the buildings in the city.” That kind of thing. We had a lot of content that was in the first &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; game that wasn’t necessarily authored to show that feature off, but we knew that it would be in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; from pretty early on. One thing it does is, the artists know to put a lot of care into the material properties that they author. So this is a metal and it behaves this way, and all of those physical material properties, so when it comes together it fits nicely when ray tracing is turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3nD3tD8Us0wSWmI8B-1fDc67CI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507746/RACRA_Parade_Float_Combat.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YaLIfl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some big, obvious features we can see in terms of the benefits of the PS5, like the fast load times or the rifts that pull you into a parallel world immediately. But are there any examples of smaller, less obvious things that are cool or that you’re really proud of that wouldn’t have been possible on the PS4?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lmy0f"&gt;With the SSD, it’s easy to say there are no load times, and look how fast we can load this other area, but it has all sorts of knock-on effects. We don’t need to be as careful with how we package our data. All of the assets for an area don’t need to be collated on the spinning hard drive to get the right streaming speed out of it. It makes the game smaller on your hard drive; it means we can patch it more easily. That’s a nice bonus. We unload the things literally behind you from a camera perspective. If you spun the camera around, we could load them before you see that. That lets us devote all of our system memory to the stuff in front of you right now, that you need to experience in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtzCGZ"&gt;The ray tracing is nice and shiny — well, literally shiny — and it’s very obvious when it’s working. But it does have a really subtle effect on the materials. There’s a part where you’re in the spaceship with Rivet and Clank, for example, and you’re not actually looking at a reflective surface per se, but just all of the metal things in that cabin, which are all curved in different ways, are all showing the effect of those characters shifting position in a realistic way. It takes us a long way toward getting the same feeling of an animated film. The way things are grounded in the environments, the way they’re animating with each other, helps us close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNrZA6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that the goal? To have it look like a high-quality animated film?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGtqgq"&gt;Certainly for this title, from a rendering quality perspective, we would love to be delivering stories in the same way that those films deliver stories, and having that emotional effect for players. I think between the performance capture we do know, the detail and density of the animation rigs that we have, we can tell some really good stories that I think can hit in the same way that the films hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUA5Tx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that you’ve spent some time with the PS5, and the studio has made three games for it, what are some aspects where you’re excited to see where it goes in the future? Some feature where you can’t wait to see how Insomniac or other studios will be able to exploit it for future games. What do you think is the thing people will really be able to dig into?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0h6Tn9"&gt;Behind the scenes, there’s so much to peel back about the SSD and the I/O around it. We’re just scratching the surface of it. As a developer, that will be really cool to see how it turns out. I love seeing what the other internal PlayStation studios are doing, we have an awesome relationship with them. We don’t show each other everything all the time, so we still get that fun surprise and delight when we see what they’re doing and get to marvel at how good it looks… and then try to pick it apart and see how to do better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get a government-paid discount on your broadband </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0VSs6-nM67vX-UDEmnm0m0TOjPY=/0x0:945x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270446/EBB_Program_Social_Media_Post_Images_Option1_Telehealth1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gWCc31"&gt;The past year, a lot of people were laid off or otherwise unable to pay for basic necessities. So the &lt;a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf"&gt;stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; passed by Congress in December included a provision to pay for broadband and other basic tech for those who, because of job loss or other financial difficulties, can’t afford to pay for it on their own. And starting this week, if you qualify, you can take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kf2rdg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; is being administered by the FCC and offers a temporary discount on monthly broadband bills — up to $50 a month (or $75 if your household is on qualifying Tribal lands). If your income qualifies, you can also get a one-time discount of up to $100 for a computer or a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgqz9D"&gt;It’s not a lot, considering how much tech costs these days, but every little bit helps. And applications for that discount will be available starting today, May 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GCs6Bw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a variety of ways you can qualify for the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ji2jm"&gt;There are a variety of ways &lt;a href="https://www.lifelinesupport.org/do-i-qualify/"&gt;you can qualify for the program&lt;/a&gt;. Qualifications can include your income level (at or below 135 percent of &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/2021-poverty-guidelines"&gt;the Federal Poverty level&lt;/a&gt;), participation in a program such as SNAP or Medicaid, job loss due to the pandemic, or other criteria. You can get more information by either visiting the &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-faq-emergency-broadband-benefit"&gt;FCC website&lt;/a&gt; or by going to &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;getemergencybroadband.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDFd5I"&gt;If you think you qualify, you can either &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;apply online&lt;/a&gt;, contact your current broadband provider to see if they are participating in the program (or &lt;a href="https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report"&gt;check this list for a provider near you&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/help/resources/#instructions"&gt;print out and complete an application&lt;/a&gt; and send it to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kdkprs"&gt;Emergency Broadband Support Center&lt;br&gt;P.O. Box 7081&lt;br&gt;London, KY 40742.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yZoQ0N"&gt;One warning: if you think you may qualify, don’t put off sending in the application. This is a temporary program, and you lose your benefit when the fund runs out of money, or “six months after the Department of Health and Human Services declares an end to the COVID-19 health emergency” — whichever is sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vHraN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 12th, 2021, 9:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect the fact that applications are available as of today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVhEO5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6QQ18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Blade 15 Base gaming laptop is $400 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIUdKE3MFTkuNqKKG6d7GUQWGkg=/1x0:3652x2434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273838/blade15hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jdcpfl"&gt;Best Buy is hosting a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740347250580356040#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-day flash sale&lt;/a&gt; on a few items, and its small assortment of gaming laptops stood out from the rest. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; seems like a good midrange laptop with its hexa-core Intel Core i7-10750H processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti graphics chip, and 16GB of RAM. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740345418605163261#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This model costs $1,100 today only&lt;/a&gt;, down from $1,500. In terms of other noteworthy specs, it has a 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate and Thunderbolt 3 for fast data transfer, or to connect to the company’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18624843/razer-x-chroma-gpu-enclosure-thunderbolt-3-gaming-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;external GPU enclosure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3HBMx"&gt;It’s a bit disappointing that it comes with a paltry 256GB of storage, though it has an extra M.2 slot available to stick in another NVMe or SATA M.2 SSD. You can check out Razer’s page for more detailed specs of this specific laptop model &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-03519E11-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, which lists it at $200 more than this deal at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xo7CG1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10495866"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Adfxmi"&gt;If you’re okay with a gaming laptop that makes no effort to look subtle, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740346419241856017" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ ROG Strix G15 isn’t a bad deal at $850&lt;/a&gt;, also at Best Buy (normally $1,000). Compared to Razer’s laptop above, this one has the same processor, but with a bigger 512GB SSD and a slightly faster 144Hz refresh rate display. Though, it likely won’t be as good for gaming since its Nvidia GTX 1650 Ti is a notch below the 1660 Ti in terms of performance, and it has half the amount of RAM as Razer’s option above. Still, this seems like a fine machine if you don’t play the most graphically demanding games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1ZcgfX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10495882"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S9pKqz"&gt;A speedy USB-C wall adapter is a good thing to have on hand for your Android phone, iPhone, or any other device like a Nintendo Switch or a laptop that can recharge from the reversible plug. RavPower has a two-pack of its 20W USB-C adapters selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PG1BJ5T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $11.69 (before tax) at Amazon by clipping the 10 percent off coupon&lt;/a&gt; located right beneath its listing price. Many power-hungry devices require more than 20W to recharge at full speed, but these are a perfect fit for most phones — especially the latest iPhones, which don’t include a charger with purchase. Apple sells one separately, but it costs $20 for one instead of nearly half that price for two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHgyXL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10495834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Y9LE7L"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YR3FCF1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Get this three-pack of USB-C to Lightning cables&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon for $13.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pyQVvm"&gt;Lastly, Daily Steals is offering a good deal on the unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL with 128GB of storage. You can get the “not pink” version of the phone that’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-pixel-3-xl-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked%3Fvariant%3D39302656000087&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F12%2F22431993%2Fbest-buy-gaming-laptop-sale-asus-razer-ravpower-charger-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new with a one-year warranty from Google for $240&lt;/a&gt; by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEPXL3 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Despite being a few years old at this point, this phone still has good photography chops and it will be among the first devices to get the upgrade to Android 12 software later this year (though it will likely be the last major update coming to this phone, security patches aside). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check out Dieter Bohn’s original review here&lt;/a&gt; for photo samples and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ktjw7u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Dota 2’s The International returns in August with $40 million prize pool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ESPORTS-GAMING-INTERNET" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/usWGX5-IhUyO_39C5pd1EfbY33I=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273700/1163941109.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2LDhBt"&gt;One of the biggest esports tournaments in the world is coming back for 2021. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3066366095803889976"&gt;Valve announced&lt;/a&gt; that The International, the annual &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; championship, will return after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21175145/the-international-2020-valve-dota-2-coronavirus-delay"&gt;a one-year hiatus caused by the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s iteration will take place in Stockholm, with the group stage starting on August 5th. The International is well-known not only for its intense, global competition, but also for being incredibly lucrative: this year’s tournament will feature a prize pool of $40 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aUI2tt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re waiting to release additional details on attendance options.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3q1qrp"&gt;While we know that the tournament will be taking place, it’s not clear yet whether fans will be in attendance. “As we continue to plan the event around the shifting landscape presented by the ongoing global pandemic, our focus remains on finding ways to hold a high quality tournament in the safest way possible,” Valve wrote in a blog post. “This means we’re waiting to release additional details on attendance options as we gather more information on developments heading into summer. We expect to be able to share more with the community during the month of June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hhFXi"&gt;As part of the announcement, Valve also introduced a new &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; feature called supporters clubs. Players are able to buy in-game items like badges and loading screens, with 50 percent of sales going directly to their favorite esports team. The feature will support 17 teams starting today, with more expected to be added over time. “As more content from other teams is submitted and approved, they will be added to this list regularly,” Valve said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycKYHP"&gt;In 2020, the pandemic forced most esports competitions across the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196237/esports-leagues-online-coronavirus-call-of-duty-overwatch-league-of-legends"&gt;to shift to online competition&lt;/a&gt;. However, this year, some in-person events have slowly started to return. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303379/league-of-legends-iceland-lol-mid-season-invitational-valorant-champions-riot-games"&gt;Riot is currently holding &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; tournaments in Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22380705/overwatch-league-2021-season-live-events-china"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League is planning to hold multiple live matches in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon updates the Echo Show 8 and 5 with better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XssPrkJmTm5RYFqV6YsF-8mGsTY=/0x120:2880x2040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273526/Echo_Show_8_Kitchen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqSiTj"&gt;Amazon is refreshing a handful of products in its Echo line: the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 5, plus it’s adding a Kids Edition of the Echo Show 5. The big new feature on both models is the camera, but the upgrade is more impressive on the bigger Echo Show 8. It now has the same 13-megapixel sensor that you’ll find on the Echo Show 10. Instead of moving the screen around to point at you as the 10 does, the Echo Show 8 provides a wider, 110-degree field of view. Within that range, it does the pan and zoom trick to keep subjects centered in the frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6eMGz"&gt;To power that trick and some other new software features, Amazon says there’s a new “octa-core” processor inside the Echo Show 8. Otherwise, it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;same Echo Show 8 that we reviewed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, with dual speakers and a choice of either white or charcoal gray. It still sells at the same price, $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12GFyU"&gt;The other software tricks include using the camera to detect if a human has walked into the room and then plugging that information into routines (like turning on the lights). Amazon emphasizes that this is an opt-in only feature and it even requires users to manually punch in a code during setup to ensure they really mean to turn it on. It also does its human shape detection locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J6oQJh"&gt;Amazon will also let all Echo 8 and 5 devices turn on Alexa’s security mode, so you can remotely view the cameras from your phone. Finally, the Echo Show 8 is getting new AR effects for Amazon’s own video chat service, including “reactions” like filling the screen with hearts or setting custom virtual backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUW7cv"&gt;As for the smaller (and more popular) Echo Show 5, the upgrades are less impressive. The camera is doubling in resolution, from one megapixel to two. It won’t have the horsepower to do the follow mode on the camera. However, the Echo Show 5 is getting a permanent price drop; it’s now $84.99. It comes in the same charcoal and white colors but adds a new blue option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpqkIt"&gt;If you want to spend $10 more, you can get a Kids Edition of the Echo Show 5 with a wild print on the rear fabric. That extra $10 also includes a year of Amazon Kids Plus services and a two-year warranty against whatever damage your child can inflict on the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah8oJg"&gt;All three versions of the Echo Show should be available for order immediately, but shipping could take a few weeks — even Amazon is not fully immune to chip shortages, it seems. As for fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16378472/amazons-echo-spot-camera-in-your-bedroom"&gt;Echo Spot orb&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not seeing any updates today and is in all likelihood not going to make a comeback — Amazon tells us that most customers just opted for the Echo Show 5 instead. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Credit agencies can’t tell my sister and me apart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/23-9PTpkb_Z_NLVelhmyPGb6QLo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273553/4557_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been locked out of the vast invisible system that determines creditworthiness — all because I have a twin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="phwyl2"&gt;My twin sister Alita and I have a credit problem: not because we’ve defaulted on loans or skipped bills, but because the US credit rating agencies can’t seem to tell us apart. Sometimes they associate her name with my social security number, sometimes it’s the other way around — and sometimes we both show up under the same SSN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4YAZv"&gt;When I applied to work at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, my background check gave my name as Alita Clark; Mitchell Clark was listed as an alias. Over and over, Alita and I have been rejected for credit cards, despite both having good credit. I was rejected for a car loan by a bank that I’ve used for years — despite having enough cash to immediately pay off the loan. Neither of us has had issues with getting access to housing, but it’s hard to feel sure it won’t happen in the future. The problem isn’t banks or lenders but the credit system itself, a vast and invisible information network with little incentive to correct even the simplest of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EvqVGPpjnOgnYmgbFggXEzs3P18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493654/goodhire.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, I gave Vox Media my SSN, not my sister’s. She still showed up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UT4cYI"&gt;If it were a single agency or company getting it wrong, I might be able to set the record straight, but the credit system is a thicket of overlapping forces, so densely woven that it can be hard to tell which part of the system is making the mistake. In the US, three companies keep track of almost everyone’s credit history: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Most people will be familiar with their credit score —  a number supposedly reflecting how reliably you pay back lenders —  but these three companies draw on hundreds of data sources to come up with that number. As you can imagine, when you’re collecting tons of data on almost every adult in the country, mistakes happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="jKhdbK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5foEsK"&gt;In theory, consumers are supposed to have some recourse when the credit system screws up. Each agency has its own dispute process, with its own standard of documentation and evidence. Credit furnishers, the companies providing the credit reporting agencies with information, are also required to accept and investigate disputes. If those methods fail, consumers can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which will then forward it to the appropriate ratings agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KbEgi"&gt;But in practice, those investigations are anything but thorough. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-report-details-how-the-nations-largest-credit-bureaus-manage-consumer-data-2/"&gt;A 2012 CFPB investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how the credit ratings agencies manage data found that they hand off 85 percent of disputes to their furnishers — often without any of the evidence that consumers have included to back up their complaints. A lot of the time, by the time a mistake is resolved, it’s spread to another agency and the whole process has to begin again. The distributed nature of the system makes it impossible to pin responsibility for a mistake to any single party, or make anyone responsible for fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0bLeN"&gt;In lots of cases, such as mixed files or in cases of identity theft, the credit bureaus would be in the best position to know if information was incorrect, says Evan Hendricks, a credit reporting advocate who literally wrote the book on credit scores and how the system can go wrong. “But they don’t care. Because of the creditors instructing them to keep it on, they keep it on.” He says it was “the fundamental business model of the credit bureaus to faithfully put on your credit report what creditors furnish and to faithfully keep it on further creditors’ instructions once you dispute it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9ZmTOy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If I ever want to get a mortgage, I’ll likely have to get a lawyer involved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XslkEH"&gt;I found this out the hard way. Starting in 2017, I pulled my reports from all three agencies, hoping to figure out which ones had me listed as Alita and how to fix it. Since the system was already too mixed up for fact-based verification to work (I’m often asked about student or car loans that I’ve never heard of), I had to mail in a physical copy of my social security card and driver’s license, then wait for the reports to arrive by mail. Experian seemed to have everything right, but Equifax had my SSN listed as my sister’s. TransUnion had the right social security number, but my name was listed as Alita Clark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSI9g3"&gt;I filed disputes, sending copies of my social security card, driver’s license, and birth certificate. When I checked back a few months later, it seemed like the fixes had mostly worked. My TransUnion report had my name and SSN, though Alita showed up as an alias. Equifax also had my information right, but it says I was “formerly known” as Alita. Both had my correct credit history. So far, so good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ILaiT"&gt;In 2019, I applied for Apple’s new credit card, wanting to try it as soon as it came out. My application was denied, and after some digging, I realized it was &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209218"&gt;likely being handled by TransUnion&lt;/a&gt;. I requested a report from them and got back a reply addressed to, you guessed it, Alita Clark. After months of working to fix the errors in my reports, they had crept back in — and someone else’s mistake was keeping me from getting Apple’s shiny new credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yInYWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Who are we? Depends on which credit reporting agency you ask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zVSC6H"&gt;My sister and I both filed complaints with the CFPB, and for a while, the situation seemed to be fixed. I finally got my Apple Card and was even able to access my credit report through online channels again. But it was only a matter of time before entropy slipped back in. I was rejected for a car loan late last year, and today I’m back to not being able to access my TransUnion or Equifax reports online. If I ever want to get a mortgage, I’ll likely have to get a lawyer involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7RiRf"&gt;For her part, my sister says she feels like “a ghost in the shell.” One credit bureau replied to her correction request (which included her social security card and driver’s license) with a letter saying they couldn’t fix it — which was addressed to Mitchell. “Clearly, they didn’t even look so why should I try again,” she told me. As for the reports she was able to get back after they had supposedly been corrected, they were “a bizarre Frankenstein” of our credit histories: alongside some of her real accounts, there are credit pulls from car insurance agencies I looked into, and even one from my local hospital — neither of which have shown up on any of my reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYZDPj"&gt;To sum up her feelings, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAxsvjHbP5A"&gt;she sent me this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TGgytX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10484429"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMAa5R"&gt;You rarely hear about these issues, but they’re surprisingly common — and not just for twins. People can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/16/9340511/perstin-experian-bank-death-credit-reporting"&gt;declared dead by credit agencies&lt;/a&gt;, get stuck in limbo after a name change, or just slip through the cracks. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/section-319-fair-accurate-credit-transactions-act-2003-fifth-interim-federal-trade"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC asked 1,001 consumers to request credit reports from the big three agencies. Roughly 26 percent of the study participants found incorrect information on at least one of their reports. In 2015, the FTC in &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/01/ftc-issues-follow-study-credit-report-accuracy"&gt;a follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; asked 121 consumers to examine unresolved disputes — and almost 70 percent of them believed that their errors still hadn’t been corrected. There have been congressional hearings, lawsuits with regulators, and decades of political pressure, but the system simply refuses to shape up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNKA6V"&gt;There has been work done to make the credit reporting process more visible to the general public — in 2014, the CFPB &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-calls-on-top-credit-card-companies-to-make-credit-scores-available-to-consumers/"&gt;called on credit card companies&lt;/a&gt; to start providing their customers with free access to their credit scores, and &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/credit-cards-give-free-fico-scores"&gt;now many do&lt;/a&gt;, with some even letting non-cardholders access their score for free. This lets consumers keep an eye on their credit score, which could give them a warning that something’s gone wrong if it seems lower than it should be or if there’s a sudden change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi9Jrq"&gt;But that’s really only a first step. If you noticed a discrepancy on your credit report, that could just be the start of a long, drawn-out fight with one or more credit reporting agencies. Even when victims sue agencies and win, the damages aren’t great enough to incentivize better behavior. Hendricks tells me that even when cases end up with large punitive damages against the credit reporting agencies, they tend to get reduced. “[T]hey don’t achieve their purpose of punishing the company and more importantly deterring from continuing the same conduct,” he says. “So basically, they just haven’t been spanked hard enough to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Bk5e6S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bsWULB"&gt;Alita and I both actually have credit cards in our names; I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; got one as part of writing this article. While my main bank wouldn’t give me an auto loan, I was able to get one through the dealership’s bank, a local credit union. I was also able to pass the credit check that my new apartment complex pulled, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQzGFz"&gt;But we’re both lucky, in many ways. First, neither of us is causing trouble for each other. My sister’s even more financially responsible than I am, and she’s never been in any sort of legal trouble. But if she did default on a loan, would that show up on any of my reports? If I went to jail, would that prevent her from getting a job at some point? Quite honestly, we don’t know. The answer may actually be “it depends on what credit reporting agency you ask.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qj7JyR"&gt;But there are people for whom this kind of issue could be devastating. It’s not hard to imagine a situation where someone falls on hard times and is looking for a lifeline in the form of credit, and then discovers that they’re ineligible, due to some bureaucratic snafu. As the system currently stands, we have three companies that have a vast amount of control and little meaningful oversight. Until some sort of regulatory power steps in, the tangle of the system may only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo Switch is finally getting a $10 calculator app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUUOPQtZZiPBs7WM_loGB87rul4=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273405/ezgif_1_8a81e255fc40.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It features a similar design to the old iOS calculator app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sabec / Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="un7DNi"&gt;We’re in a relatively quiet period for Switch releases while we wait for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;’s remaster to release in July&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, today marks the arrival of a new &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/calculator-switch/"&gt;$10 calculator app&lt;/a&gt; on Nintendo’s console, which should stop your machine from gathering too much dust over the coming months. Hell yeah. Math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxktoO"&gt;The app, which was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-11-nintendo-switch-is-getting-a-calculator-app-priced-gbp8"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is literally just called “Calculator” and is being published by Sabec. It’s single-player, which unfortunately rules out any team-based calculating, and it works in TV and handheld modes, according to its product page. We’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that the app bears a striking resemblance to the &lt;a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/iphone-ios-and-the-hidden-scientific-calculator"&gt;iPhone’s old calculator app&lt;/a&gt;, but being charitable, it’s possible that the app is only guilty of drawing inspiration from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/3/4297816/iconic-1987-braun-calculator-designed-by-the-legendary-dieter-rams-to"&gt;Dieter Rams’ classic design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BE5nU6t2LHNHn--aThvsxZ7dbo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508817/ezgif_1_8e39159430ef.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sabec / Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Math.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xS81xu"&gt;Unlike Sony’s and Microsoft’s consoles, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217049/nintendo-netflix-wii-u-3ds-switch"&gt;Nintendo’s previous machines&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch doesn’t have much in the way of non-gaming apps. It doesn’t have Netflix, Spotify, or those other pieces of software that we’ve come to expect will appear on basically any piece of electronics with a screen. But now, finally, it has a calculator app. Thank god. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap suspends two anonymous messaging apps after cyberbullying lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxZY5opdJ-Y2Focq931L4zHCjbc=/73x0:858x523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273388/msedge_cu2FZIRvnP.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images from Yolo’s now-removed App Store listing.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Yolo Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="now5a4"&gt;Snap will suspend two anonymous messaging integrations from Snapchat after a lawsuit sought to hold them responsible for a teenager’s death, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-05-11/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit was &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-10/lawsuit-snap-teen-suicide-yolo-lmk"&gt;filed on Monday&lt;/a&gt; by Kristin Bride, the mother of a teenager who died by suicide in June after being bullied on the two apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf6ySx"&gt;“In light of the serious allegations raised by the lawsuit, and out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the Snapchat community, we are suspending both Yolo and LMK’s Snap Kit integrations while we investigate these claims,” a spokesperson for Snap said in a statement. Representatives for the two apps, Yolo and LMK, did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YBxOBa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are suspending both Yolo and LMK’s Snap Kit integrations while we investigate these claims”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D28Vdb"&gt;Yolo and LMK are developed by third-party developers, and they integrate with Snapchat via its Snap Kit platform. LMK lets users create polls and Q&amp;amp;As for their Snapchat friends to answer, while Yolo is focused on Q&amp;amp;As. Both services let users send messages anonymously which facilitates cyberbullying to such a degree that the apps should be considered dangerous, the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqQQSp"&gt;Last year, when Carson Bride was found dead by his family, his phone history showed that he’d searched how to “Reveal YOLO Username Online” that same day. The lawsuit alleges that over a period of several months he had been receiving anonymous bullying messages, which made sexual comments and taunted him over incidents at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="EpcSho"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLR1hR"&gt;As of this writing &lt;a href="https://onyolo.com/"&gt;Yolo&lt;/a&gt;, which the suit says is owned by Yolo Technologies, appears to no longer be available on either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. &lt;a href="https://www.lmk.chat/"&gt;LMK&lt;/a&gt;, which is developed by LightSpace, is still available for download &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lmk-anonymous-messages/id1463320976"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightspace.lmk&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; mobile app stores, but attempting to share content to Snapchat generates an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOAXBu"&gt;Both apps make various promises about protection against bullying on their platforms, the &lt;em&gt;LA Times &lt;/em&gt;notes. Yolo reportedly warns users during setup that it has “no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users,” while an &lt;a href="https://lmk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047469394-What-is-LMK-doing-to-ensure-safety-within-the-app-"&gt;FAQ from LMK&lt;/a&gt; says it goes “to great lengths to protect our community” with a combination of automated and human moderation. The plaintiffs argue that the two apps violate consumer protection laws by failing to enforce their own terms of service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u46R8Q"&gt;Worries that Yolo could be used for bullying have been around for years. As early as 2019, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the app’s model could be open to “teen misuse.” &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-yolo-app-snapchat/?europe=true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt; that a previous anonymous messaging app Sarahah was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-43174619"&gt;kicked off app stores&lt;/a&gt; over its bullying problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62yweF"&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act generally protects social media companies from the actions of its users. But Section 230 typically applies to posts rather than app functionality, and US courts have recently shown willingness to hold broader platforms liable when a specific integration proves dangerous. Last week, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420679/snapchat-speed-filter-wrongful-death-lemmon-snap-appeals-ruling-section-230"&gt;appeals court ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Snap can be sued over a speed filter, following allegations that it encouraged reckless driving. The claim was that the design of the product encouraged dangerous behavior, with users believing that hitting speeds of 100 miles per hour would unlock an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vTDA5"&gt;The Bride family is seeking damages on behalf of all 92 million Snapchat users, and for the two apps to be banned from the market until they can prove they have effective safeguards in place. The lawsuit specifically says it doesn’t want to punish the users who sent the bullying messages, only the companies that facilitated them; namely Snap and the developers of Yolo and LMK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="grBUFL"&gt;The claims in this action are not about third-party users’ communications; hence, this action does not focus on the users’ communications themselves nor does it seek to punish the senders of the bullying and harassing messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOZuAF"&gt;Rather, the claims here are about how the anonymous messaging apps designed and distributed products and services that are inherently dangerous, unsafe, useless. For decades, anonymous messaging apps been known to cause severe and fatal harm to teenagers, hence, the harms caused by Defendants’ apps were foreseeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZJLWz"&gt;Bullying problems have been rampant on social networks like Instagram for years. In response, the Facebook-owned social network has introduced a variety of features aimed at curtailing abuse, including warning messages when users post &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024051/instagram-captions-potentially-offensive-ai-moderation-bullying-edit"&gt;potentially offensive captions&lt;/a&gt; and filters to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308012/instagram-offensive-comment-filtering"&gt;remove bullying comments&lt;/a&gt;. As of February this year, Instagram said its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278219/facebook-transparency-report-q4-2020-harassment-hate-takedowns"&gt;bullying and harassment takedowns had nearly doubled&lt;/a&gt; since last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook review: a Chromebook for grown-ups</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect, but it’s practical&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0Icn7o"&gt;Recently, I’ve reviewed a large number of Chromebooks aimed at students. They are a target market for many manufacturers, due both to the dominance of Google Classroom across many different grade levels and also to Chromebooks’ affordable price tags (compared to similar Windows and macOS machines). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dfaaqt"&gt;But adults and professionals like Chromebooks, too. Some may be power users running Linux applications, some may make heavy use of Google Workspace in the office, and some may just like Chrome OS. That’s who the Thinkpad C13 Yoga Chromebook is for: it’s a Chromebook for grown-ups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY4DuZ"&gt;That means it breaks some stereotypical “Chromebook” conventions. Mainly, it’s not cheap: it’s not too far from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; in price. Lenovo isn’t the first company to try this shtick: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have both targeted this market with $999 Chrome OS machines in the past, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/dell-latitude-7410-chromebook"&gt;Dell Latitude Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; floating around that are even more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dUBXrb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10488215"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vz61jA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a Chromebook for grown-ups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oX2bhd"&gt;But the C13 Yoga is my favorite attempt at a premium, convertible Chromebook that I’ve seen to date. It has the ThinkPad features that have made Lenovo so dominant in the business space for so many years: the lightweight and sturdy build, the excellent keyboard, the solid specs, the business-focused privacy features, and more. It’s not perfect, but it’s practical. And ultimately, it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJzb7M"&gt;Put this Chromebook next to other members of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad&lt;/a&gt; line, and you could fool me into thinking it was another premium Windows machine. ThinkPads are known for their sturdy builds, and this one is no exception. The chassis is aluminum all around. There’s no flex in the keyboard or the screen — and I can’t remember the last time I said that about a Chromebook. The 360 hinge is sturdy, and there’s no screen wobble at all. The C13 achieves all this without getting too clunky: it’s 3.3 pounds and 0.61 inches thick. Lenovo says it’s been tested against 12 “military-grade” certification methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eocVN1"&gt;The display on my review unit is a 300-nit 1920 x 1080 IPS panel. The C13 is also one of very few 13-inch Chromebooks that offers a 4K OLED display option — that one gets up to 400 nits. Most people shouldn’t need that one, as the FHD screen is good. It delivers nice colors, good contrast, and impressive details. It does have the cramped 16:9 aspect ratio, something I’ve been glad to see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;other ThinkPads&lt;/a&gt; shifting away from this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nHHv7h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano review: light it up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"},{"title":"Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 review: a ThinkPad with a twist","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22351156/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook seen from the front on a tile counter. The screen displays a white castle surrounded by trees with mountains in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bh8rgZ6RYfv1pVzy-O8U1J5mneU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505260/mchin_20190730_4573_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solid for work and play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mjs1U"&gt;Elsewhere, you’ll see a number of other signature ThinkPad flourishes. There’s a very comfortable backlit keyboard, including the signature red Trackpoint in the center. (It does come with a standard Chromebook layout, rather than the usual ThinkPad layout, though the inverted-T arrow keys remain.) ThinkPad fans will also recognize the discrete clickers on the top of the touchpad, as well as the match-on-chip fingerprint sensor on the right side of the keyboard deck and the tiny webcam shutter. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBrhUegWPpZfTnzHrE89cYXgiWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505251/mchin_20190730_4573_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shutter is so tiny you probably can’t see it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ1uMj"&gt;There are some unique tidbits as well. There’s a Google H1 security chip inside, which works like the TPM chips that you’ll often find in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339981/acer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Windows business laptops&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an optional camera on the keyboard deck (in addition to the one on the top bezel) which you can use to snap forward-facing photos if you’re using the C13 in tablet or tent mode. There are two stereo speakers on the bottom of the device which deliver a nice surround quality, though the audio itself is tinny and not great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="rVM7f5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll see a number of other signature ThinkPad flourishes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AMD Ryzen 5 sticker on the bottom left corner of the ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ytMKUBI5SfRP8Dt8nQ05ayQZAbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505255/mchin_20190730_4573_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powered by AMD Ryzen, in case you forgot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Thinkpad logo on the bottom right corner of the C13 Yoga Chromebook." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHaDIAsEyYS0MhaXJaM2ViqYyrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505250/mchin_20190730_4573_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a ThinkPad, too, by the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyX7Nf"&gt;But the really exciting thing about the C13 is that it’s the first Chromebook to use AMD’s Ryzen Mobile 3000 C-series processors. AMD introduced this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449826/amd-athlon-ryzen-3000-c-series-processors-chromebooks"&gt;“C-series”&lt;/a&gt; last fall as a line specifically designed for Chromebooks. That said, they’re mostly rebrands of older AMD chips — the Ryzen 5 3500C that’s in my C13 model is basically a renamed Ryzen 5 3500U from the regular 3000 Mobile series. This is two generations old now (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;5000 mobile Series&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year), but it’s still a solid processor for this kind of computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwqEDv"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-c-series%2FThinkPad-C13-Yoga-Chromebook-Enterprise%2Fp%2F20UXCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22424783%2Flenovo-thinkpad-c13-yoga-review-price-specs-features-amd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base C13&lt;/a&gt; starts at $909 for 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and an Athlon Gold 3150C processor. That’s a terrible deal for $909, but Lenovo pricing is often weird and randomly discounted and this configuration is currently listed at a more reasonable $590.85. The model I have is listed at $1,247 (but currently available for $810.55) — it comes with the Ryzen 5 3500C, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. That’s still a &lt;em&gt;bit &lt;/em&gt;high for those specs, but it’s a more reasonable value. I appreciate that the storage is a PCIe SSD (rather than the slow eMMC storage that companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;sometimes&lt;/a&gt; try to sneak into pricey Chromebooks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlzwQe"&gt;This is definitely the best-performing Chromebook I’ve used in quite some time. I used the device as my primary driver for a few days, running well over a dozen Chrome tabs and Android apps, and I almost never felt heat or heard the fans unless I put my ear to the keyboard deck. Nothing slowed the system down, either. I was able to edit a batch of photos in Adobe Lightroom with a dump of tabs and apps open and both a Zoom call and Spotify running in the background, and the experience was just fine. Speaking as someone who’s tested a number of sluggish budget Chromebooks recently, it’s really refreshing to see Chrome OS running this smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook on a tile counter, seen from above, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-y4oH1mc44WwUJ34mWQc4pXFPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505248/mchin_20190730_4573_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powered by a “new” AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsBA5b"&gt;AMD has claimed that its integrated Vega graphics are the best graphics you can get in a Chromebook, and while I can only verify that claim anecdotally, I had a significantly better gaming experience on the C13 than I ever have with an Intel Chromebook. &lt;em&gt;Rest in Pieces&lt;/em&gt;, one of my favorite mobile games, is usually a playable-but-stuttery experience on Chromebooks. But it was quite smooth on the C13, without a stutter in sight. Photo editing, in both Google Photos and Adobe Lightroom, was also no problem on this machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mv8khr"&gt;I ended up running a couple benchmarks to see how this system stacks up to competition. On AndroBench, which measures the speed of the storage, the C13 Yoga Chromebook was well ahead of the pack on the majority of tasks, and head and shoulders above the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;. On Geekbench 5, the C13 scored an 890 on single-core and a 2963 on multi-core. While those scores aren’t as good as those we’ve seen from our top Chromebook pick, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-713#:~:text=On%20the%20Geekbench%205%20overall,the%20category%20average%20of%201%2C774.&amp;amp;text=This%20outdoes%20the%2083.9%20category,Pixelbook%20Go%2C%20which%20got%2085.9."&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, (and don’t compare to the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, of course), they’re still close to the top of the Chrome OS pack, beating scores we’ve seen from &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-chromebook"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2#:~:text=The%20Galaxy%20Chromebook%202%20we,with%208%20GB%20of%20RAM)."&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/5203147"&gt;Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifPTQw"&gt;I also found the built-in stylus to be smooth and responsive on this touchscreen, though it was a bit of a pain to remove from its garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgVCxU"&gt;One disappointment underscores all of this, and that’s battery life. Though the C13 has a reasonably sized 51Wh battery, I only averaged six hours and two minutes of continuous use with the screen at 50 percent. I ran trials using all kinds of Android apps, and trials using just Chrome, without seeing a massive difference. I’ve seen significantly more than that (with the same workload) from all kinds of Chromebooks, not to mention Windows and macOS laptops. This certainly makes me hesitant to recommend that anyone get the 4K screen option — I can’t imagine that most people will get acceptable battery life on those configurations if this is what I’m getting with the FHD screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjExn_oCuIAf6SlsDMBv39dH4IU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505252/mchin_20190730_4573_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports on ports on ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard of the Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95olDWAhcTvQXDMiURe-HM0i1Qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505254/mchin_20190730_4573_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t forget the keyboard nub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8zUfi"&gt;I’d be more willing to let this battery life slide on a budget device (though plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;budget Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; last much longer than this). But on a $1,247 device, I’m disappointed not to see an all-day life span. Sure, the processor is powerful, and there’s often a trade-off between performance and efficiency. But all kinds of Windows laptops at this price point leave this battery life in the dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez1Rfc"&gt;One other concern: I could never actually get the fingerprint sensor to read my fingerprint. Lenovo says it hasn’t seen this problem before, so it may have been an issue with my unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7aVQHW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android apps work well on the C13&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d93c6b"&gt;Android apps were hit-or-miss on Chromebooks when I first started reviewing them, but many of them work well on the C13. Messenger used to brick my device every time it got a notification, for example, but it now works just fine. That said, most of the services I use on a daily basis — Twitter, Messenger, Gmail, Reddit, etc. — are equivalent or slightly better experiences in Chrome, and some work-related Android apps (like Slack and Google Docs) are still bad on Chromebooks. So I generally don’t use Android apps too much except for things like Podcast Addict, which don’t really have browser equivalents — but I’m happy to see the ecosystem improving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZaZip"&gt;The C13 also supports Chrome OS’s tablet mode, which has gotten better, especially with the stylus. It supports various handy Android-esque gestures (swipe up to go home, for example). The device sometimes took a second or so to rearrange and resize all my Chrome windows after I switched it back to clamshell mode, which isn’t the worst thing in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XONSxu"&gt;The ThinkPad line is, in many ways, the opposite of what many people consider a Chromebook to be. ThinkPads are traditionally expensive, and they’re very well made. But times are changing (or at least, companies like Lenovo are trying to make them change). Why shouldn’t Chrome OS fans get a ThinkPad option, too?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook seen from above half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w5bLNUpXn_BU3tmACzw7HGF9Yz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505257/mchin_20190730_4573_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looks like a ThinkPad, feels like a ThinkPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7cHzRW"&gt;The C13 Yoga isn’t a perfect machine. The 16:9 screen makes me sad, and the battery life is a big miss. It’s a bit expensive for what it offers, as is often the case with laptops targeting business users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3mlRb"&gt;With that said, the C13 is also the closest thing to a MacBook that I’ve seen yet in the Chromebook space. It has a solid, sturdy build that looks and feels premium. It has a strong processor, an excellent keyboard, and a solid screen, and it comes from a highly respected brand with a devoted base of fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8ICB7K"&gt;So while the C13 may not be the right choice for most people — there are more affordable Chromebooks with better battery life that will be a better buy for most consumers — it’s objectively a neat device that will probably make a certain sect of Chrome OS users happy.
