    <title>Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is down to its lowest price yet at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gp87MpEN52NqscYEa18exklB5S8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948540/dbohn_201109_4283_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XmzMm7"&gt;At $129, Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is an expensive accessory. But if you are looking to buy this charger at a more reasonable price, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734601368358516496" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has knocked $29 off the MagSafe Duo&lt;/a&gt; today, bringing the price down to $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLZ0eF"&gt;The MagSafe duo is a 2-in-1 charger that allows you to wirelessly charge select iPhones, Apple Watches, certain AirPods wireless charging cases, and other Qi-certified devices. If you plan to buy this charger, keep in mind that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;does not include a USB-C charging brick&lt;/a&gt;, which you will need to buy separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DM0Q7t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTx0D8"&gt;If you’re an Apple Watch owner who has either a 40mm or 44mm model and you are looking to buy a new loop for your wearable, you’re in luck. &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-sport-loop-for-apple-watch-40-or-44-mm"&gt;Daily Steals&lt;/a&gt; is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers the opportunity to buy an Apple Watch Sport Loop in select colors for only $18 with code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEAPL &lt;/strong&gt;applied at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AGuII"&gt;We think this is a good deal for a few reasons, most notably because these are Apple-branded Sport Loops, which normally retail for $49 on Apple’s direct website. Additionally, a few colors are not available on Apple’s website that Daily Steals has available, such as a Pride-themed Sport Loop. These Sport Loops also include a one-year warranty through Apple. It’s worth noting, though, that there are more options for the 44mm-sized Apple Watch models than 40mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCHb2t"&gt;This promotional code only applies to one strap in your cart, so if you buy more than one, the code will only adjust the price for one unit. However, we had luck getting this deal twice with two separate transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bpArmf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qzizg3"&gt;Best Buy knocked down the price of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734506907090543434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a refurbished pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; to $80. If you are apprehensive about buying refurbished products, Woot is currently selling a brand-new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://sellout.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-wireless-earbuds-13?ref=w_gw_dd_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds in black for only $105&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QeIuf9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="F8Wn77"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How Facebook could escape the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZXh4sodaQmeqVd8Vww-iGVUkBM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948516/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;h2 id="xX13Ed"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6OrQHl"&gt;In December, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;voted 3-2 to sue Facebook for illegally maintaining a monopoly in social networking&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit, which was accompanied by a separate suit joined by 49 US attorneys general, alleges that Facebook used acquisitions and software restrictions on developers to prevent competitors from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAyncH"&gt;The government’s case appeared shaky from the start, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook"&gt;I wrote at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Its allegation that Facebook owns a monopoly in advertising-supported social networking felt overly narrow and blinkered; the case does not even mention the existence of TikTok. And its suggestion that Facebook should have done more to share data with third-party developers seemingly runs counter to the FTC’s own privacy enforcement actions — in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/07/ftcs-5-billion-facebook-settlement-record-breaking-history"&gt;the agency fined Facebook $5 billion&lt;/a&gt; for sharing too &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;data with developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0pFFVB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So why does Facebook think its Hail Mary has a better chance of success?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aAcEv"&gt;At the same time, the case &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/7-questions-and-answers-about-the"&gt;contains numerous incriminating emails&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that Facebook executives acted knowingly to reduce competition by making acquisitions including Instagram and WhatsApp. And the states’ suit in particular articulated a compelling theory of harm: that Facebook’s privacy policies worsened as competition decreased, making life worse for the average consumer. This is important because recent antitrust law has focused on cases that have caused prices to rise for consumers; companies like Facebook (and Google and Amazon) have escaped scrutiny until now in large part because they offer their services for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6w6kj"&gt;It’s against that backdrop that I read Facebook’s response to the government, which it filed in court on Wednesday. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-dismiss-antitrust-suits-saying-it-hasnt-harmed-consumers-11615400041?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;Brent Kendall in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ClLg3a"&gt;Facebook on Wednesday asked a federal judge to dismiss antitrust lawsuits by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, arguing that government enforcers have no valid basis for alleging the social media giant is suppressing competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCkPIa"&gt;The FTC “utterly ignores the reality of the dynamic, intensely competitive high-tech industry in which Facebook operates,” the company said in seeking to dismiss the commission’s case. In a second motion, Facebook argued the states’ case “does not and cannot assert that their citizens paid higher prices, that output was reduced, or that any objective measure of quality declined as a result of Facebook’s challenged actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="blLANr"&gt;A motion like this is, on one hand, totally expected — if you’re Facebook, why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; try to get this case thrown out as soon as possible — and, on the other hand, unlikely to succeed. No matter how wobbly the government’s case against Facebook appears from Silicon Valley, it is the product of years of investigation. I imagine a judge would be inclined to at least let the government make its case at trial, but we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxfdoy"&gt;At the same time, Google — which is facing a similar set of US antitrust lawsuits — &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/tech-antitrust-google-idUSKBN27N03W"&gt;declined to filed such a motion&lt;/a&gt; when presented with the opportunity last year. So why does Facebook think its Hail Mary has a better chance of success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8t0eI9"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/motions-to-dismiss-ftc-state-ag-lawsuits/"&gt;laid out its arguments in a blog post yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, it complains about the government’s tortured efforts to define a market small enough for Facebook to credibly monopolize. It complains that the government cannot specify what exclusionary things it did in the wake of purchasing Instagram or WhatsApp, or restricting access to its data, that actually broke the law. And it raises various questions of standing and timing that I won’t try to assess here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WA1x9S"&gt;In response, the government dismissed these arguments, though not in any great level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u15jwn"&gt;“Facebook is wrong on the law and wrong on our complaint,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323642/facebook-antitrust-ftc-states-new-york-dismiss-instagram-whatsapp-acquisition"&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the states’ case, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We are confident in our case, which is why almost every state in this nation has joined our bipartisan lawsuit to end Facebook’s illegal conduct. We will continue to stand up for the millions of consumers and many small businesses that have been harmed by Facebook’s unlawful behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCBfBi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BOIZbx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lO63Jm"&gt;Is there a better case to be made against Facebook than the antitrust complaints that actually got filed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92nKOy"&gt;I wondered that while rereading &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;this great 2018 David Streitfeld profile of Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, who President Biden will reportedly nominate to the FTC. Khan helped inspire the current antitrust moment with a widely read paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox&lt;/a&gt;,” which moved the discussion of competition issues away from a decades-long focus on price increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdH9yE"&gt;“We’re finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it,” Khan told Streitfeld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQ8Sza"&gt;This has been a necessary and productive reversal. As more of our lives move online, we can’t help but notice all the ways in which our activities are enabled and monitored by a small handful of West Coast companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n11FEI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A badly written lawsuit could still succeed at trial — but first it has to make it there&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BE5fbd"&gt;Facebook owns three of the most popular apps in the world; is a primary news source for billions; hosts a significant portion of global political speech; runs a large marketplace for physical goods; is building a significant consumer hardware division; and developed a cryptocurrency (now operated by a consortium) intended to power a worldwide payments network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYmKUu"&gt;It is a quasi-state operating in parallel with all the other nations where it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxvkaz"&gt;Laws that were truly rooted in a suspicion of concentrated power, I think, might have intervened earlier in this state of affairs. Regulators could have expressed more skepticism about acquisitions; crafted a national privacy law; or written standards for data portability. They could have required Facebook to offer nondiscriminatory access to parts of its infrastructure, as if it were a public utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ehs7a"&gt;None of which would have required rethinking antitrust laws that may not be suited to the purpose that regulators are now pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6PlP6"&gt;Perhaps existing laws will turn out to be well-suited for that purpose after all. Perhaps the newly Democratic Congress will write some new ones, as they have long been promising to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd6jqq"&gt;Or perhaps, given that the consumer internet is now &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-social-networks-got-competitive"&gt;the most competitive it has been in the past half-decade or so&lt;/a&gt;, it won’t much matter either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1u1QcU"&gt;I don’t think Facebook’s motion to dismiss is likely to end the government’s ambitions to rein in the company. But it does highlight the steep challenge facing the FTC in the short term. A badly written lawsuit could still succeed at trial — but first it has to make it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DyIjDc"&gt;
&lt;p id="sbsV0r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjClkk2ldX_lpGTSH2AHq5uAFWU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948450/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="po4bal"&gt;Everyone had a different moment when the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic snapped into place. It may have been the day they heard a report about a case in their area, the moment someone got sent home from work, or the day schools closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0uApP"&gt;For many people, it was March 11th, 2020 — the day the news never stopped and the virus upended everything. The National Basketball Association &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21176000/nba-suspends-season-coronavirus-utah-jazz-gobert-test-covid-19"&gt;suspended its season&lt;/a&gt;; Tom Hanks announced that he tested positive for coronavirus; and the World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced that the COVID-19 outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21156325/coronavirus-pandemic-who-declares-covid-19-outbreak-global-h1n1"&gt;was a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vy1hQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/buzzfeednews/march-11-covid-tom-hanks-nba-who"&gt;talked to&lt;/a&gt; scientists, producers, campaign advisers, Broadway performers, NBA players, and others to capture what it was like to live through the moments that showed how much everything was about to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="o9eYxg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYuPjn"&gt;Mark Tatum, deputy commissioner of the NBA, described watching Anthony Fauci talk about the league during a congressional hearing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="J2FUwA"&gt;Dr. Fauci was asked whether the NBA was underreacting or the Ivy League was overreacting following the Ivy League’s decision to cancel its conference tournament. We were all watching when Dr. Fauci said, “We would recommend not having large crowds. If that means not having anyone in the audience when the NBA plays, so be it.” That was the morning of March 11. We all heard it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ih0AXg"&gt;WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris was in the room when Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was a pandemic: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="M3ruGf"&gt;Because there was a buzz around the term “pandemic” and this sort of sense of moment around the term, we did realize people would take it as a more important moment than it was in terms of management of the response. But we also realized that it was important to be describing it that way because it was critical that countries got the message: This is very, super, super serious. This is not a game. This is not a test. This is not a dress rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="39KKJS"&gt;And Chet Hanks talked about going on Instagram to reassure people that his parents were “fine.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DI1x4p"&gt;Everyone I know was hitting me up, sending their wishes and whatnot, so I just figured I would just address it &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-chet-hanks-coronavirus_n_5e6a25c9c5b6bd8156f25ced"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; because people were really worried, and I just wanted to reassure people that my parents were OK and everything was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TCtIIe"&gt;Go read the full story &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/buzzfeednews/march-11-covid-tom-hanks-nba-who"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beeple sold an NFT for $69 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A square collage of 5,000 works from Beeple, start with the oldest in the top left corner and continuing to recent works in the bottom right corner." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7U6MmjZcbR3163LQYJc6SIEW28=/0x500:3000x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948365/2021_NYR_20447_0001_001_beeple_everydays_the_first_5000_days034733_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Beeple’s collage, &lt;em&gt;Everydays: The First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt;, sold at Christie’s. | Image: Beeple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yl5tQy"&gt;Until October, the most Mike Winkelmann — the digital artist known as Beeple — had ever sold a print for was $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6zsGA"&gt;Today, an NFT of his work sold for $69 million &lt;a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924"&gt;at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;. The sale positions him “among the top three most valuable living artists,” according to the auction house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhHTVf"&gt;The record-smashing NFT sale comes after months of increasingly valuable auctions. In October, Winkelmann sold his first series of NFTs, with a pair going for $66,666.66 each. In December, he sold a series of works for $3.5 million total. And last month, one of the NFTs that originally sold for $66,666.66 was resold for $6.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktV2PJ"&gt;NFTs have absolutely exploded over the past few weeks — and Winkelmann, more than anyone else, has been at the forefront of their rapid rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5rzwEH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I do view this as the next chapter of art history.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okBTOa"&gt;“He showed us this collage, and that was my eureka moment when I knew this was going to be extremely important,” Noah Davis, a specialist in post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It was just so monumental and so indicative of what NFTs can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKrSK4"&gt;A few factors explain why Beeple’s work has become so valuable. For one, he’s developed a large fan base, with around 2.5 million followers across social channels. And he’s famously prolific: as part of a project called “Everydays,” Winkelmann creates and publishes a new digital artwork &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;. The project is now in its 14th year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AowLgu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Christie's is proud to offer "Everydays - The First 5000 Days" by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beeple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@beeple&lt;/a&gt; as the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house. Bidding will be open from Feb 25-Mar 11.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more here &lt;a href="https://t.co/srx95HCE0o"&gt;https://t.co/srx95HCE0o&lt;/a&gt; | NFT issued in partnership w/ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makersplaceco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@makersplaceco&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/zymq2DSjy7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zymq2DSjy7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Christie's (@ChristiesInc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChristiesInc/status/1361670588608176128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VRYjSS"&gt;At the same time, NFTs have blown up over the past month and — for the moment, at least — are being seen by many as &lt;em&gt;the way&lt;/em&gt; digital art will be acquired and traded going forward. For collectors who believe that’s true, the escalating prices are nothing compared to what NFTs will be worth down the road, when the rest of the world has caught onto their value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OVJkC"&gt;Christie’s is also a legitimizing force for both Winkelmann’s art and NFTs as a technology. The 255-year-old auction house has sold some of the most famous paintings in history, from the only known portrait of Shakespeare created during his lifetime to the last-discovered painting by Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUFjIG"&gt;Combine that with Winkelmann already being at the forefront of NFT sales, and today’s auction was destined to set records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cZRUK"&gt;“I do view this as the next chapter of art history,” Winkelmann said. “Now there is a way to collect digital art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HL0Y7h"&gt;The piece that was sold, &lt;em&gt;Everydays: The First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt;, is a collage of Winkelmann’s work starting at the beginning of the project, when he was posting somewhat crude sketches. It runs through years of evolving digital shapes and sceneries up through the beginning of this year, when he was posting &lt;em&gt;extremely crude&lt;/em&gt; political illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5inp9a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I really thought it was the right catalyst.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0t1Pz0"&gt;The auction’s winner doesn’t get much: a digital file, mostly, plus some vague rights to present the image. But Winkelmann expects to work with the buyer to find various ways to display the piece physically, whether that’s on a TV in their house or projected onto “the side of a fucking building” at Art Basel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcOUQF"&gt;There’s already been pushback against the rise of NFTs. Plenty of works of questionable artistic value are being sold at hype-driven auctions. Artists’ works have allegedly been stolen and auctioned off as authentic. And many artists are concerned about the climate impact of art sales that rely on blockchain technology, which is notoriously inefficient by design. (Winkelmann said he plans to buy carbon offset for all his NFTs going forward so that their impact is a net positive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HraGva"&gt;Those who are early to the space think the tech is here to stay. Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile, the collector who bought a Beeple for $66,666 and resold it for 100 times that just four months later, started collecting digital art a year ago and co-founded the Museum of Crypto Art in part to display his growing collection. He sees Winkelmann’s rising sale prices as a way of proving to the public that the technology matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDaT9b"&gt;“The reason I did that sale was in no way shape or form for the money,” Rodriguez-Fraile said. “I really thought it was the right catalyst to signal the validation of what’s happening in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MskSSb"&gt;At Christie’s, Davis plans to work with more digital artists to auction NFTs. With a growing crop of smaller marketplaces and countless number of NFTs being created daily, he sees Christie’s role as helping to promote the space in an “extremely thoughtful” way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyfuSE"&gt;“We have more responsibility than we’ve ever had in any collecting category as arbiters of the items that we’re selling,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eisgg"&gt;The plan isn’t to pull more traditional artists into the digital world (a Jeff Koons NFT isn’t next on the list, Davis joked), but to work with established digital artists to explore their “alternative art history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96yzKY"&gt;Rodriguez-Fraile believes that the next wave of artists and collectors will come to see NFTs as simply the way art is bought and sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgtbIM"&gt;“I’m confident it’s not a hype thing,” he said. “It’s the catalyst for a generation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The art of upcycling old sneakers into high-fashion corsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Side by side photos of models wearing FRISKMEGOOD corsets made of sneakers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHK0YtsR2KXaCBUpMP9_7bvI2-M=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948254/friskmegoodcomp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Designer Cierra Boyd’s FRISKMEGOOD clothing line reworks upcycled sneakers into futuristic fashion.&lt;/em&gt; | Photos: FRISKMEGOOD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fjbHuK"&gt;Modern fashion is fraught with wasted product, so some designers are thinking about ways to transform these unwanted goods into artistic pieces meant for the runway. One of those is &lt;a href="https://www.friskmegood.com/"&gt;FRISKMEGOOD™&lt;/a&gt;, a futuristic brand that creates upcycled high fashion and editorial pieces out of used or deadstock sneakers and other secondhand finds. Owner and designer Cierra Boyd found success on her &lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/friskmegood/"&gt;Depop shop&lt;/a&gt; when her signature designs — corsets and bodysuits made from old or unused shoes — were featured on its Explore page. Now, her brand’s ballooning popularity has enabled Boyd to pursue opportunities beyond her online shop.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAhwGh"&gt;Boyd, based in Cleveland, Ohio, now lives and works in her studio apartment after three years of growing her business and creativity from her mom’s house. While she hopes to eventually expand, everything one can find on her shop and &lt;a href="https://www.friskmegood.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has been handmade by her. Her corsets and bodysuits have gained her followers on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/friskmegood/?hl=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, been presented in fashion shows, and most notably, worn by American rapper &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKhQc7AHC6e/?igshid=17nzsyww89o9u"&gt;Dream Doll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Hw8QU"&gt;The corsets and bodysuits aren’t all that Boyd upcycles, though. I reached out to her to chat about sustainable fashion, how she creates her sneaker designs, and what she has planned for FRISKMEGOOD™.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmSWRK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZDR5v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the inspiration behind the bodysuits and corsets made out of repurposed sneakers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev5vvf"&gt;It kind of came about all by chance. I was in a design competition in 2018, in Cleveland. It was Fashion Mania 2k19, and I was given three challenges. One goal was to create something without using fabric. I was stumped. I did not know what to do. I had everything done with the other two challenges, but it was getting down to the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNf5cj"&gt;Luckily, one night I was watching Vice while I was designing and an episode came on about a guy who made a mask out of sneakers. I was like, wait, what if I made a top out of sneakers? So, I tried to make a top and it didn’t look right. I moved it down a little and I was like, “Oh, well this is kind of cute as a corset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNLJaW"&gt;I just rolled with that and I put it on Depop. People bought it! I was super surprised but it also gave me confidence. At the time I really didn’t know how to feel about it, but I just put it out there anyway to see how people will respond. The response was overwhelming. So I never stopped making them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZZJxs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After realizing people liked the sneaker corsets, how did you begin to source your material?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugdV2I"&gt;At the beginning, I was using stuff in my attic and stuff that I had around the house. When I started to deplete that inventory, I did go to thrift shops. Recently, for the bodysuits, I found a place here in Cleveland that has deadstock sneakers. They have sneakers that have been in their stores since the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9HrSy"&gt;A lot of their inventory is extremely old, the sneakers are falling apart. I’m not gonna lie, one time I found mouse droppings in shoes. It’s really crazy and rough in there. It’s a lot, but they give me the sneakers that are damaged or the average customer wouldn’t buy. I use that to upcycle them into the bodysuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yw7AS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you even find this place?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhHPNL"&gt;It’s funny because it’s right down the street from my house, and never in my life have I gone in that warehouse. I used to go to elementary school around that area. I would pass that place my entire life and never went there. Then one day I was like, let me just see what they got in there. It was like a gold mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOZ2ET"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you are choosing your shoes or the deadstock, do you choose the shoes with the design in mind?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYwYH6"&gt;I work a lot different from other designers. Some designers draw their designs beforehand, but for me, I usually let the materials give me the story instead of vice versa. I let the clothes tell me the story. I have to see it to know what I’m going to do with it. It’s really like a visual thing. When I see it I’d be like, oh, that’d be a cute bodysuit, and then just get five pairs of them if I can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOb8f7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever run into the issue of not having enough to make something?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDQFsw"&gt;Oh yeah, definitely. The warehouse is so unpredictable. I have to bring my mom with me most of the time to help me because it’s a lot to sort through. I’m literally on the floor going through all the shoes on the bottom, searching for a match. It can be stressful, but if there is a match, I always get it. Like I said, I need like five or more [shoes] to do what I really want to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Omyxd3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a certain size in mind when you’re looking for them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYJ7il"&gt;Everything is so random. I usually just go with whatever I find, but if I am looking for something that’s more like a plus-size look, I’ll go for size 10 and up. Usually for smalls and mediums, you can even use kids’ shoes. [Size] five is usually the lowest I’ll go — five or four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWTpUt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you are thinking about size, are you making pieces so your size range is inclusive or are you making them for a specific client?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgnkTa"&gt;What I do ... nothing is planned. If I do find that 10 or 12, you know, that’s perfect, but if I don’t, then I don’t. It’s kind of like an “it is what it is” situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooIjds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other types of clothing or fabrics do you upcycle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F04T1e"&gt;I’ll use anything from bedsheets to other materials, like maybe hoodies and sweatshirts. Another thing that I just started doing is called tufting. Which is kind of like the art of making rugs, but instead of making rugs I put tufted art on the front of it. It’s a fairly new thing and I haven’t even dropped it yet, but basically it’s made out of yarn. And what I’m trying to do with that is give a new vibe and a new feel to an old, blank, unloved sweatshirt, T-shirt, or thrifted item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njxhr0"&gt;Even jeans. I use jeans, denim and socks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rpUtVJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time goes into making a piece?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuMIV6"&gt;It depends on which piece you’re talking about. I usually do things in bulk, too. So, for a bodysuit, I’ll buy like five different styles. I’ll work on five at once. That whole process can take two to three days. For the tufting, depending on how many I’m doing, what it is, it can take like one to four days to do. It takes up a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrfQ3U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a personal favorite from your collection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2JI4M"&gt;It’s so hard. I have so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqgJ9s"&gt;One of my favorites that I’ve done, that I’m proud of, is my Air Force One bodysuit. That’s for plus-size women or anybody who identifies as a woman. My uncle donated those shoes to me. I didn’t have to go out and even buy those. It was just pretty much perfect, so that’s definitely my favorite, for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcIOe6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You sell your clothes on Depop now. Is that where you started?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BEEfF"&gt;Yes, that is where I started. Depop is how people found out about me. Before Depop I was on Instagram trying to figure out, how do I get more people to see it? When Depop came along, I ended up getting pictures on the Explore page and the Explore page puts you literally right smack dab in the front. So when people started to find me from that it was a chain reaction, and more people started finding me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pEnuO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see Depop as the hub for futuristic fashion like yours? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwKH2a"&gt;Yes, it definitely reminds me of if you could just go to a worldwide thrift store online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42INiS"&gt;I joined their Now / Next program, which is an incubator-program-slash-grant that they gave me. I get mentorship and money towards working on my Depop shop. They’ve given me so many chances to be on the forefront of their platform. I’ll be on their Instagram page. It’s just crazy how much support they have given me. They’ve invited me to Depop Live, which is an event that, pre-COVID, you can sell your stuff in person. My stuff sold out. They have been a complete blessing in disguise for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LU6UYQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any future plans for FRISKMEGOOD™?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwbhby"&gt;I have a lot of future plans. Everything is in the works right now. We are a global brand right now. We definitely do get a lot of international customers. I hope on growing, expanding, and figuring out how I can take FRISKMEGOOD™ to the next level. You know, how to get my stuff on more celebrities. I have a showroom now that houses my pieces, so that way I can get more celebrity visibility with my brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TXvgu"&gt;Everything is falling in line, slowly but surely. I hope this year I can find more innovative ways to create fashion, to continue to change the way that people view sustainable fashion. I just want to change the way people think when it comes to sustainability. When you think sustainability, you don’t automatically think luxury at all. I’m really trying to show people that sustainable and old pieces that might never have been loved again, can be loved again. It can be high fashion and it can be luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlg2QF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WN9AV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqoJ3U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZE3sh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiHuaC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop Go on a table angled slightly to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UZ9mdUxw-DkKVmIqP29-0LLQBPA=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948215/twarren-surfacelaptopgo-7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALZBsW"&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic closed most offices, more and more official papers were being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) These days, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isjki5"&gt;Unfortunately, while Windows doesn’t offer a built-in PDF signing feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321383/signature-pdf-mac-pdf-how-to-preview"&gt;the way a Mac does&lt;/a&gt;, there are third-party apps you can download that will give you the same ability. In this case, I’m using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, which is Adobe’s free PDF reader. Here’s how to set it up and use it to sign your PDF documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SgeMF3"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fget.adobe.com%2Freader%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22323097%2Fpdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Download Adobe Acrobat Reader DC&lt;/a&gt;. Adobe has the unfortunate tendency to encourage people to download excess apps, so make sure you uncheck all the additional installations that may pop up on the page: in my case, it was two McAfee apps and Acrobat’s Chrome extension. (You can install this last one later if you think it might be useful.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fyH4Ve"&gt;After you click on “Download Adobe Reader,” you can start the install by clicking on the downloaded .EXE file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/niGsIsy1D5YvmE7KouzVOkm-ru0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360298/adobe1___Copy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wknfyV"&gt;At the end of the installation, Acrobat Reader DC will ask if you want to make Adobe Acrobat Reader your default PDF application. Up to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BW88IR"&gt;Once it’s installed, Acrobat Reader will open. Look for “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” in the main window. Click on that and then click on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Start by selecting “Fill &amp;amp;amp; Sign,” and then choosing the PDF file you want to work with" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aejRWsys0IOOYznD9lg8crU2fk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360300/adobe10.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start by selecting “Fill &amp;amp; Sign,” and then choosing the PDF file you want to work with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="71mubA"&gt;Alternatively, you can open the file first (by going to “File” &amp;gt; “Open”) and then select the “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” feature from the app’s right-hand column. (If you don’t see any labels under the icons, it’s the one that looks like a pen in the act of writing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HoZ2ay"&gt;A new window will ask “What do you want to do?” Click on the “Fill and sign” button under the left-hand picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Fill and sign”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUBamFlkK849IGpmp16-D9ECH0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360323/adobe5.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Fill and sign.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r5zYEz"&gt;Your document will come up in Acrobat. Click on the “Sign” icon (another pen) in the top line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D8AxRd"&gt;Click on “Add Signature.” (If you already have added a signature, you can use the “Add Initials” choice to save a second signature, if you wish.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOATBa_airg9-mBWX2dJMv-TNkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360365/adobe6.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EdgQjv"&gt;A pop-up window will give you three ways to sign your document: type your name (Adobe supplies you with several handwritten-looking fonts), draw your signature (either using your touchpad or directly on a touchscreen), or upload an image of your signature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JdYWBB"&gt;However you create your signature, if you will want to use it in the future, make sure the “Save signature” box is checked. Then click on “Apply.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are several ways you can create a signature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGmXg75kGQyZue77CYS5TfEVabI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360374/adobe7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are several ways you can create a signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ImiYmj"&gt;Once you’ve hit “Apply,” your PDF document will be back. Place your new signature where you want it on the document and left-click. You can then change the size or placement of the signature if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can place your signature where you want it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IeZnhslHjxqUAMB30lt8pma3a-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360383/adobe8.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can place your signature where you want it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ldRjRL"&gt;And you’re done! Now, if you want to add your signature to a PDF, just open your document using Adobe Acrobat Reader and click on the “Sign” icon. You can then select your saved signature and place it where you need it on your PDF document.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature is now available whenever you need it" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kd5_FmENt_zLnAnHO_m1CQeh-rc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360852/adobe12.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature is now available whenever you need it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ojzgTu"&gt;Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is, of course, not the only app that you can use to read and / or edit a PDF document. There are a variety of other apps out there with free versions that will let you do basic PDF work, such as &lt;a href="https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing?_ga=2.98293343.1191478015.1615406363-173908718.1615236989"&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://smallpdf.com/sign-pdf"&gt;Smallpdf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.docsketch.com/"&gt;Docsketch&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of those free versions come with limitations — for example, both HelloSign and Docsketch let you sign up to three documents a month, while Smallpdf lets you process up to two documents per day. Adobe Reader doesn’t have any limitations on your ability to sign documents, but if you want to create a PDF, or export it to another format, you’ll have to get the Pro version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Series X / S consoles are in stock again at Target [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uB33gQ8koCixzJA9CbqMzexkqpE=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948041/twarren_200909_4177_0030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VDZvv5"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-s-console%2F-%2FA-80790842&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; consoles are some of the most sought-after consoles to buy right now. Those looking for another shot to get either console can buy one right now at Target. You will have the option to pay for either console in full or through Xbox All Access, allowing you to get either console upfront at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF1Mn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323661/sony-playstation-5-digital-edition-restock-target"&gt;Similar to the PS5 restocks that went up earlier this morning&lt;/a&gt;, Target is limiting the purchase of these next-gen consoles to in-store pickup only. Not every store has the next-gen Xbox hardware in stock and the ones that do have a very limited supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwoxv5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g4d2am2QVwE2P1xHRfOjyrHAKCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362437/Screenshot__234_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fewer than five units are available at my local Target.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BLuT14"&gt;Once you secured your next-gen Xbox, I would suggest stocking up on games and accessories that will allow you to get the most out of your new console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynkRau"&gt;Several of the most popular games to play on these consoles include third-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some popular Xbox One titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have all received graphical updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sah8hS"&gt;Of course, if you are unsure what games to buy, you could always subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of first- and third-party titles from various developers and publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xmQCoE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="PbVSAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce6rHG"&gt;A must-have accessory I think is worth buying is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt;, more so if you are planning to play local cooperative games with loved ones as the console only comes with one controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2zGBUP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="eglaXe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="FtJmt6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Gr17X"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15081398/facebook-stories-snapchat-camera-direct"&gt;introduced Stories&lt;/a&gt; to its platform four years ago, mostly as a way to encourage people to post content that wasn’t highly produced or necessarily photogenic. Now, it’s giving some users a chance to make money through that content. The company announced a test today that’ll allow some creators to place ads that look like stickers into their stories and receive a cut of the resulting revenue. The initial test is “very small,” Facebook says, but it hopes to expand it “soon” and then apply the technology to all short-form videos on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTANnA"&gt;In a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Yoav Arnstein, director of product management, says he can’t share creator or advertiser partners because the test is still in the early conceptual phase. He said the broader idea, though, is to give advertisers a natural place to fit their content, so, for example, if someone posts a video from Yosemite National Park, a sticker could advertise a local business. The contextual relevance will likely be key to making these advertisements successful, Arnstein says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EwUA7"&gt;The story stickers are only one of the company’s various updates to its creator platform today. It’s also making its usual in-stream ads available for shorter videos. Previously, only three-minute or longer videos could monetize with these ads, but now, one-minute-long videos can receive ads, which will be placed 30 seconds into the content. Videos longer than three minutes can place ads as soon as 45 seconds into the programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00KAE8"&gt;To qualify for these in-stream ads, pages that publish them must have 600,000 total minutes viewed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from any combination of video uploads — on-demand, live, and previously live — in the last 60 days, as well as five or more active video uploads or previously live videos. Meanwhile, live video creators now must have 60,000 live minutes viewed in the last 60 days to monetize through in-stream ads, in addition to meeting the video-on-demand program requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRcDxy"&gt;Facebook is also spending $7 million to promote its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687603/facebook-creators-stars-subscriptions-supporter-groups"&gt;Stars feature&lt;/a&gt;, which lets viewers of live content tip with virtual stars, which each pay a creator a cent. The company will make free Stars available during certain live streams, and viewers can them send to the videos’ hosts. The team will also introduce virtual gifts that viewers can send. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAAi8U"&gt;“We want to enable more people to actually go and experience this delight of actually going and supporting a creator, and we think this is a relatively new behavior that we want to make more ubiquitous across the app, and we think this is a great way to do that,” Arnstein says about why Facebook is investing in the Stars. “We think that can help also incentivize creators to experiment more with the type of content and the type of engagement directly with fans that will actually enable and incentivize this type of direct support from fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzpUOW"&gt;Finally, Facebook is expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239863/facebook-live-paid-video-charge-stream-access-events"&gt;paid live events&lt;/a&gt; to 24 additional countries and its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/fan-subs"&gt;fan subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; to 10 more countries. The company won’t collect revenue from either of those features through at least August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd4PFi"&gt;All of these various announcements clearly add up to the idea that Facebook wants to monetize as much creator content as possible through ads. The Stories sticker has potentially the biggest implications, particularly for Instagram, and could usher in a world that’s slightly less focused on full-screen ads and more on those integrated into the content itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building the ultimate retro computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYmmD9CaG42QjKfInOJHCh4iIHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947935/sbyford_210303_4461_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The MiSTer FPGA project recreates classic hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1nZQ3Y"&gt;Although I assembled it myself, and its software all comes from an open-source DIY project, in many ways my MiSTer is the most versatile computer I own. It’s a shapeshifting wonderbox that can change its own logic to make itself run like countless other machines as accurately as possible. From old arcade boards to early PCs to vintage consoles, MiSTer developers are devoted to helping it turn into an ever-expanding range of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iqIjr"&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to use computer software or hardware that is no longer available for sale, you’ve probably run into emulation before. It’s a huge field that often involves a ton of people working on a technically challenging feat: how to write software that lets one computer run code that was written for another. But there’s only so much traditional emulators can do. There are always inherent compromises and complexities involved in getting your current hardware to run software it was never designed to handle. Emulated operating systems or video games often encounter slowdown, latency, and bugs you’d never have encountered with the original devices. So what if there was a way to alter the hardware itself? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwrAsQ"&gt;Well, that’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki"&gt;MiSTer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an open-source project built upon field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, which means it makes use of hardware that can be reconfigured after the fact. While traditional CPUs are fixed from the point of manufacture, FPGAs can be reprogrammed to work as if they came right off the conveyor belt with the actual silicon you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lraXVX"&gt;What this means is, you’re not tricking a processor into believing it’s something else, you’re setting it up to run that way from the start. A MiSTer system can theoretically run software from the NES to the Neo Geo, to the Apple II or Acorn Archimedes, and deliver responsive, near-as-dammit accurate performance next to what you’d get from the actual devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L03Iho"&gt;Of course, it’s not as easy as that makes it sound. In order to program an FPGA to act like a computer from three decades ago, you have to intimately understand the original hardware. And that’s what makes MiSTer one of the technically coolest DIY projects going today, building on the knowledge of developers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iokMOyjxIrNK7EsXsujij4ReT0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360565/sbyford_210303_4461_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The DE10-Nano sandwiched between the I/O and USB hub boards.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zclj9O"&gt;FPGAs aren’t new technology. Two early companies in the field (sorry) were Altera, now owned by Intel, and Xilinx, now part of AMD. The two have competed since the 1980s for market share in programmable logic devices, largely serving enterprise customers. One of the biggest advantages of FPGAs on an industrial scale is that companies can iterate their software design on hardware before they need to manufacture the final silicon. FPGAs are widely used to develop embedded systems, for example, because the software and the hardware can be designed near-concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sENDm"&gt;You might be familiar with FPGAs if you’ve come across Analogue’s boutique console clones, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date"&gt;Mega Sg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review"&gt;Super Nt&lt;/a&gt;. Those use FPGAs programmed in a certain way to replicate a single, specific piece of hardware, so you can use your original physical cartridges with them and get an experience that’s very close to the actual consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBRSZ9"&gt;The MiSTer project is built around more accessible FPGA hardware than you’d find in commercial or enterprise applications. The core of the system is an FPGA board called the DE10-Nano, produced by another Intel-owned company called Terasic that’s based out of Taiwan. It was originally intended for students as a way to teach themselves how to work with FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXnSLX"&gt;The DE10-Nano looks somewhat similar to a Raspberry Pi — it’s a tiny motherboard that ships without a case and is designed to be expanded. The hardware includes an Altera Cyclone V with two ARM Cortex-A9 CPU cores, 1GB of DDR3 SDRAM, an HDMI out, a microSD card slot, a USB-A port, and Ethernet connectivity. It runs a Linux-based OS out of the box and sells for about $135, or $99 to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0pSbh"&gt;MiSTer is inspired by MiST, an earlier project that made use of an Altera FPGA board to recreate the Atari ST. But the DE10-Nano is cheaper, more powerful, and expandable, which is why project leader Alexey Melnikov used it as the basis for MiSTer when development started a few years back. Melnikov also designed MiSTer-specific daughterboards that enhance the DE10-Nano’s capability and make a finished machine a lot more versatile; the designs are open-source, so anyone is free to manufacture and sell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8PNMi3DnRqf5lUPfAZzYZda74A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360563/sbyford_210303_4461_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2CjdL7B_tD-KCE0IodMwYSqZX2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360561/sbyford_210303_4461_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8Xdgeb48VBOBpcqBU7SIiKjUCE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360564/sbyford_210303_4461_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjmeNpbbReiHLvRBv9utR5KhXwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360560/sbyford_210303_4461_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O6GmXJ"&gt;You can run MiSTer on a single DE10-Nano, but it’s not recommended, because the board alone will only support a few of the cores available. (A “core” is a re-creation of a specific console or computer designed to run on the MiSTer platform.) The one upgrade that should be considered essential is a 128MB stick of SDRAM, which gives MiSTer enough memory at the right speed to run anything released for the platform to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQprUF"&gt;Beyond that, you’ll probably want a case, assuming you’d rather not run open circuitry exposed to the elements. There are various case designs available, many of which are intended for use with other MiSTer-specific add-ons that vertically attach to the DE10-Nano. An I/O board isn’t necessary for most cores, for example, but it adds a VGA port along with digital and analog audio out, which is useful for various setups. (A lot of MiSTer users prefer to hook up their systems to CRT TVs to make the most of the authentic output and low latency.) You can add a heatsink or a fan, which can be a good idea if you want to run the system for extended periods of time. And there’s a USB hub board that adds seven USB-A ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ckmIgq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Customization is part of the fun with MiSTer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Bx71x"&gt;For my setup, I ordered the DE10-Nano, a 128MB SDRAM stick, a VGA I/O board with a fan, a USB hub board, and a case designed for that precise selection of hardware. These largely came from different sources and took varying amounts of time to show up; you can order the DE10-Nano from countless computer retailers, but other MiSTer accessories involve diving into a cottage industry of redesigns and resellers. Half of my parts arrived in a battered box from Portugal filled with shredded paper and loosely attached bubble wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZuVG9"&gt;MiSTer accessories are based on Melnikov’s original designs, but since the project is open-source, many sellers customize their own versions. My case, for example, includes a patch cable that hooks directly into the IO board to control its lighting, while some others require you to route the LEDs yourself. The USB board, meanwhile, came with a bridge to the DE10-Nano that seemed to be a different height from most others, which meant I had to improvise a little with screw placements. Nothing I ordered came with instructions, so it did take some time to figure out what should go where, but everything worked fine in the end. The only other thing I had to do was go buy a small hex screwdriver for the final screws in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r59HmE"&gt;That’s part of the fun with MiSTer. There’s a base specification that everything works around, but you’re still ultimately assembling your own FPGA computer, and you can adjust the build as much or as little as you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x0zXEu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Analogue’s console clones are a way to preserve gaming’s past","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2Rz3u4"&gt;Once your hardware is set, you need to install the MiSTer software. There are a few ways to do this, and you’ll want to dig around &lt;a href="https://misterfpga.org"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub for a while so you know what you’re doing, but the method I went with was simple in the end — essentially, you format your microSD card with an installer package, put it into the DE10-Nano, plug in an Ethernet cable and a USB keyboard, power on the system, and it’ll download all of the available cores. Your SD card will then be set up to boot the MiSTer OS directly, and you can run another script to make sure everything’s updated with the most recent versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ls6EvK"&gt;The MiSTer OS is very simple, with a default background that looks like pixelated TV static and a basic menu in a monospaced font that lets you select from lists of console and computer cores. The first thing I did was load some old Game Boy Advance ROMs I dumped well over a decade ago, because for some reason Nintendo doesn’t want to sell them for the Switch. (Please sell them for the Switch, Nintendo.) The performance felt about as authentic as I could’ve expected, except for the fact that I was looking at a 4K TV instead of a tiny screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baUW4g"&gt;My main reason for getting into MiSTer is to have a hardware-based way to access the parts of computer history that I missed, or to revisit forgotten platforms that I was around for. I knew that computer systems like the Apple II and the Amiga were big gaps in my knowledge, so it’s great to have a little box that can run like either of them on command. I’ve also been getting into the MSX platform, which was popular in Japan in the ’80s. My next rainy-day project is to work on an install of RISC OS, the Acorn operating system that was on the first computers I ever used at school in the UK. (You can actually still &lt;a href="http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/101/index.htm"&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt; licensed ROM copies of various versions of the OS, which was a neat surprise.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38N-nbVAPuvUTYWoyMA7-xU3kYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360566/sbyford_210310_4461_0019.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2bE1Sv"&gt;MiSTer development is a vibrant scene. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/FPGAMiSTer/posts"&gt;Melnikov has a Patreon&lt;/a&gt; that’s updated several times a week with improvements he’s made to various cores, but there are lots of other people contributing to the project on a daily or weekly basis. A colleague introduced me to the work of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/topapate/posts"&gt;Jose Tejada&lt;/a&gt;, for example, who’s based in Spain and has made a ton of progress on replicating old Capcom arcade machine boards. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/laxer3a"&gt;another project&lt;/a&gt; aiming to get the original PlayStation running, marking the biggest step yet into 3D hardware on MiSTer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5QXVl"&gt;FPGAs are often talked about as if they’re a silver bullet for perfect emulation, but that’s really not the case — at least, not without a lot of effort. Anything that runs perfectly on MiSTer, or as close to perfectly as is otherwise imperceptible, is the result of a ton of work by talented programmers who have spent time figuring out the original hardware and applying the knowledge to their cores. Just read &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/update-35-its-48013713"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from the FPGA PSX Project about what it took to get &lt;em&gt;Ridge Racer&lt;/em&gt; running on MiSTer, as well as the assessment of how far they have to go. The cores can vary in quality, accuracy, and state of completion, but a lot of them are still under active development and huge strides have been made in the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ4USj"&gt;Analogue lead hardware engineer Kevin Horton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 about the work that went into re-creating the Sega Genesis for the Mega Sg console. The process took him nine months, including two-and-a-half months figuring out the CPU at the heart of the console. “I didn’t know Genesis very well, and knew literally nothing about the 68000 CPU at all!” he said. “This was my first foray into both things and probably slowed the process down since I had to learn it all as I went.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTroR1MGl9dFZSILkGtxUG2OY2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360568/sbyford_210310_4461_0021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ggnrj8XBUPgNqvyDqVE37eOKWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360567/sbyford_210310_4461_0020.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPZ678"&gt;Ultimately, Horton confirmed the accuracy of his work by directly connecting a 68000 to an FPGA and comparing their performance on a test that ran for a week straight. It demonstrates the lengths that FPGA enthusiasts go to in pursuit of the most accurate results possible, but what makes MiSTer special is that this is largely the work of hobbyists. No one’s paying anyone a salary to make incremental tweaks to the performance of the arcade version of &lt;em&gt;Bionic Commando&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s where Tejada has directed his passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NGda1"&gt;MiSTer is an important project because it speaks to the concept of preservation in a way that all too often goes underserved by the technology industry. The project makes the argument that the way we run software is as big a part of our experience as its content. Yes, you can port or emulate or re-release software to run on modern hardware, but there’s always going to be a compromise in the underlying code that moves the pixels in front of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="O2S55v"&gt;Of course, that might sound like a pretty niche concern for anyone who’s satisfied with, say, the emulated software you can run in a browser at &lt;a href="https://archive.org/"&gt;Archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. I’m often one of those people myself — emulation can be great, and it’s hard to beat the convenience. But the MiSTer project is an incredible effort all the same. I’ll never have a shred of the technical knowledge possessed by MiSTer developers, but I’m grateful for their effort. Once you build your own system, it’s hard not to feel invested in the work that goes into it; MiSTer is a never-ending pursuit of perfection, and there’s something beautiful about that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfzy9c"&gt;If you missed the restock for the $500 PS5 with a disc drive earlier this morning, Target has now restocked the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQCiLt"&gt;Looking at the product listing for the product, it appears Target is not shipping the item to your home address, but rather you have to choose in-store pickup. Once stores are out of stock, you likely will have to wait until the next stock drop to place an order.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Anyone living in Annapolis, MD looking for a PS5 Digital Edition? There’s a few in stock now&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sIz4uu"&gt;Once you have your PS5, you may want to consider buying some additional accessories not included with the console so you can get the most out of your new gadget; this includes an extra DualSense controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sMmMoI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQs3Og"&gt;There’s also a ton of PS5 games right now, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games or the third-party blockbuster titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-PlayStation-5/dp/B08VJNMWR8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Valhalla-PlayStation-Standard-upgrade-4/dp/B08FS5HKTR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734526510000262717" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cFEYoZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;I also recommend buying &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that were released originally on PS4, including &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted IV: A Thief’s End. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pGx761"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="zUGKyA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
