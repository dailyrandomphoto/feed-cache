    <title>Lyft launches health care transportation program </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvC2vFF-HEuu3-c76i7wJrzySAY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129666/acastro_180927_1777_lyft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAoqDy"&gt;Lyft launched a program that will let health care organizations send patients prepaid passes that they can use for rides to doctor’s appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hjLRW"&gt;“We’ve automated an important piece of health access that allows patients to be self-sufficient and in control, while allowing our partners to focus on the services they provide, rather than on administrative processes,” said Megan Callahan, vice president of Lyft Healthcare, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxhwqR"&gt;The program, called Lyft Pass for Healthcare, lets health care organizations or social services agencies create a budget and set approved pickup and drop-off locations. They can share the pass with patients, who can apply it to their ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2geVG4"&gt;Non-emergency medical transportation is &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-non-emergency-medical-transportation-overview-and-key-issues-in-medicaid-expansion-waivers/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to be a $3 billion market. Transportation is a major &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305579"&gt;barrier to health care&lt;/a&gt;, and millions of people each year put off medical appointments because they don’t have a way to get to them. Lyft &lt;a href="https://www.lyftbusiness.com/industries/healthcare"&gt;already partners with&lt;/a&gt; a number of health care organizations to schedule trips for patients, but the new program aims to make it easier for patients to request trips themselves in the app, rather than wait for the health system to schedule them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6p5UJ"&gt;Uber has a similar medical transportation program. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/1/17061862/uber-health-non-emergency-medical-transportation-hipaa"&gt;Uber Health&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in 2018, also lets health care providers book rides for patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckwmO1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In an about-face, Xfinity Mobile will offer discounts on additional unlimited plan lines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZAn9hFCgK1qnzrWebEU7RaqtGs=/89x0:2519x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129670/xfinity_mobile_laydown_6_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xfinity Mobile offers cell service on Verizon’s network in addition to 20 million Wi-Fi hotspots across the country.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xfinity Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aNvg2F"&gt;Comcast’s wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, is changing the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fmobile%2Flearn%2Fplan&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22384272%2Fxfinity-mobile-unlimited-plan-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pricing structure on its unlimited plans&lt;/a&gt;. The company will now discount additional lines on its unlimited plan: a single-line plan will still cost $45 per month, but additional lines become cheaper the more you add. With four lines on a plan, you’ll pay $30 per month per line. That’s in contrast to a previous policy of charging the same fee per line, regardless of the number of lines on a plan &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; a practice touted on its website as recently as yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGqz8U"&gt;The company points out that its $45 per month unlimited plan is still cheaper than single-line plans among the major wireless carriers, which is true: postpaid unlimited plans from the big three cost between $60 and $70 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goejcoTYS5PtgGqTzo0WSflEtQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444379/Screen_Shot_2021_04_14_at_12.43.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xfinity Mobile&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until recently, single-line customers on Xfinity Mobile enjoyed the same per-line pricing as subscribers with multiple lines, as touted on the company’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lZwEkn"&gt;But it’s also worth noting that Xfinity Mobile reduces speeds on all of its unlimited plans once a user reaches 20GB of data per month, which isn’t something you’ll see on the major carriers’ plans. That’s separate from the temporary slowdowns customers might experience when the network is busy, which is a fairly common policy across network providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLw2mX"&gt;Prices for its “By the Gig” metered plans remain the same: 1GB for $15, 3GB for $30, and 10GB for $60. It’s also still possible to mix data-capped and unlimited lines on the same plan. This isn’t the first time Xfinity Mobile, which operates on Verizon’s network, has changed pricing policies: in 2019, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750181/xfinity-mobile-hd-pass-unlimited-plan-extra-fee"&gt;began charging a fee&lt;/a&gt; to add HD streaming to accounts. Previously, it had capped streaming video resolution at 480p but would waive this limitation at no cost on request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8FKpIm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cellphone plan fine print, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tFQLp3"&gt;To be fair, both this change and the new unlimited plan pricing structure follow standard practices across the industry. Most unlimited plans limit streaming video to 480p, and all major wireless carriers charge more per line on single versus multiple-line plans. For a change, Comcast isn’t inventing creative new ways to make your bill more confusing — it’s just going with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIuJFI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia warns the great GPU shortage will continue throughout 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5UTV2MkGhIYN7SFDId_07AIq9Y=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129615/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tiEQDe"&gt;If you were hoping to pickup a new RTX 30-series GPU in the coming months, Nvidia is warning about supply shortages for the rest of 2021. “We expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year,” said Colette Kress, Nvidia CFO, on an &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2022-revenue-tracking-above-outlook?ncid=afm-chs-44270&amp;amp;ranMID=44270&amp;amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-u_56nr2EJ2TBzDSKQ9NTsg"&gt;investors call earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzGEDh"&gt;That means the difficulties of finding a new 30-series GPU will likely continue, possibly into 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;Nvidia previously warned&lt;/a&gt; that supplies would “likely remain lean” through its fiscal Q1, and now that we’re approaching that milestone (end of April) it’s clear that supply hasn’t improved significantly to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw36tF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;TSMC and Intel are also both warning&lt;/a&gt; that chip supply issues could last through 2022. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has forced some car manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt;, and consumers have found it near impossible to find new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, CPUs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lugFpP"&gt;Nvidia does note that despite the issues, supply should still increase as 2021 progresses. “We will see supply continue to increase throughout this quarter as well as throughout the year,” said Kress. Regardless, it’s still going to be difficult to find a new GPU when you have to compete with fellow gamers, cryptominers, and scalpers that are pushing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;real prices of GPUs way out of control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G is coming to the US with a 144Hz display and a whole lot more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EkhPadMVYUi0mDj-aJ7Ot6tlvas=/164x0:1373x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129504/Axon_30_Colors_1536x806.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra 5G offers a whole bunch of rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8TTDaP"&gt;ZTE has unveiled the Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other 30-series devices — the Axon 30 and Axon 30 Pro — though the Ultra has at least one unique feature: it will be sold in the US and Canada. Exact availability and pricing are still TBD, but we do know that the 30 Ultra has all of the trappings of a high-end Android device. It will offer a Snapdragon 888 processor with 8GB or 12GB of RAM, a 6.67-inch 1080p OLED with adaptive refresh rates up to 144Hz, four rear cameras including a 5x zoom, and 66W fast charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IB0C0e"&gt;The 30 Ultra features a prominent camera bump that houses plenty of pixels, starting with a 64-megapixel f/1.6 main camera with optical image stabilization. There’s another 64-megapixel camera — unstabilized with a 35mm-equivalent f/1.9 lens — and an ultrawide with (you guessed it) a 64-megapixel sensor. A periscope-style telephoto lens is coupled with an 8-megapixel sensor and includes optical stabilization. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;Axon 20 5G&lt;/a&gt;, it offers a traditional hole-punch 16-megapixel selfie camera around front; no under-screen camera here, which is a good thing in our book. Video recording from the main camera tops out at 8K/30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lnvIjV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10447167"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFwKTt"&gt;ZTE calls the phone’s 6.67-inch display a “borderless, curved” OLED panel with a 95% screen-to-body ratio. It’s protected with Gorilla Glass 5 — as is the rear panel — and includes HDR10 support. It offers adaptive refresh rates of 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, and 144Hz, which it uses depending on the application to save battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvmXfH"&gt;Rounding out the feature set, the Axon 30 Ultra 5G includes a large 4,600mAh battery that supports fast 66W wired charging. It ships with Android 11 and offers an in-screen fingerprint reader for biometric unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCRBLq"&gt;The step-down Axon 30 Pro still includes the Snapdragon 888 chipset, but features a different rear camera configuration, a non-variable 120Hz screen, and less-speedy 55W charging. The Axon 30 base model is the only one to get the next iteration of the in-display selfie camera, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/01/20/zte-teases-axon-30-smartphone-will-have-an-under-display-camera/"&gt;as teased by ZTE&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1mW1C"&gt;For now, the Ultra looks like a whole lot of phone, but it’s hard to judge just how competitive it will be in the US until we have a confirmed price. When it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available, it’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.ztedevices.com/en/"&gt;sold online&lt;/a&gt; unlocked from ZTE. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chip manufacturer TSMC warns shortages could continue through 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TAIWAN-ECONOMY-SEMICONDUCTORS-TECHNOLOGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tyiRs0MALULXRot3KLFwxYIYhB0=/5x0:4775x3180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129467/1231936348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rHjFEX"&gt;TSMC, which makes processors for Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, and numerous other big consumer tech companies, has warned that chip shortages could last through 2022. “We see the demand continue to be high,” TSMC CEO C. C. Wei said in comments &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/tsmc-profit-beats-as-chip-shortage-shows-no-sign-of-abating?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers. At that time, we’ll start to see the supply chain tightness release a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQshNE"&gt;Wei’s comments mirror predictions made by Intel’s new CEO Pat Gelsinger earlier this week, who warned that it could take a few years to address the shortage, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/13/intel-ceo-semiconductor-chip-shortage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. “It just takes a couple of years to build capacity,” Gelsinger said. Likewise, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-2022-revenue-tracking-above-outlook?ncid=afm-chs-44270&amp;amp;ranMID=44270&amp;amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-u_56nr2EJ2TBzDSKQ9NTsg"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; the graphics card manufacturer expects “demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pU048f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aeQ2m0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has impacted everyone from automakers to games console manufacturers. Car manufacturers have had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt;, while anyone looking to upgrade their gaming setup has struggled to find stock of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, CPUs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xboxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TppA3m"&gt;TSMC does have good news for its automaker clients, saying they could expect chip supply to improve next quarter. But comments from TSMC, Intel, and Nvidia suggest that the broader shortages are unlikely to abate anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjXwkJ"&gt;TSMC says it’s already running its fabs at “over 100 percent utilization,” but in the medium term it’s increasing investment in new production. “We have acquired land and equipment, and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousands of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites,” Wei said in comments &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-results-idUSKBN2C20IH"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeuzF5"&gt;TSMC now plans to invest $30 billion on upgrading and expanding its production capacity this year (up from a previous forecast of between $25 and $28 billion). It reiterated that construction at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;$12 billion Arizona plant&lt;/a&gt; is still scheduled to begin this year. Overall, the company plans to invest $100 billion to increase capacity in its plants over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the best Windows File Explorer design concept I’ve ever seen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-HnCHUXF1kw4jH_5hTJ9MhrxO8s=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129461/fileexplorer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;File Explorer concept.&lt;/em&gt; | Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K62khu"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows File Explorer has existed in the operating system since Windows 95, and it has served as a focal point for design concepts ever since. I’ve seen a variety of mockups over the years that try to redesign the File Explorer and modernize it, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/"&gt;Reddit user Alur2020&lt;/a&gt; has really nailed what modern file management should look like in Windows 10. This is the best Windows File Explorer concept I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdnNDA"&gt;The concept, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/mouth-watering-user-concept-of-windows-10-file-explorer-has-reddit-salivating/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is immediately striking for its sheer simplicity and usability. The default home area imagines a location where you can quickly see pinned items, drives, and recently used files. It’s a simple location to find anything important. Alur2020 has also incorporated Microsoft’s new Windows 10 system icons, and even color coded groups for files and folders much like macOS’ Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIGZkSYosBT6JmlQ7tNU2z6rcjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445533/qr815nfao5t61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;File Explorer concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J487z5"&gt;Aside from the pure design, this concept also imagines what tabs might look like in a modern File Explorer. It looks very similar to Microsoft Edge browser tabs, allowing File Explorer users to open up multiple folders in a single view. Microsoft was working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17092752/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-tabs"&gt;Sets feature for Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; that included tabs in File Explorer, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512250/microsoft-windows-10-sets-feature-app-tabs-removal"&gt;put this work on hold&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago. It’s not clear whether File Explorer will ever officially get tabs support in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMnxS4"&gt;This concept File Explorer also offers up a cleaner way to deal with images in folders, with a minimalist ribbon of options. There’s even nested folders on the side panel, allowing Windows users to quickly switch between folders that are buried deep in multiple folder structures. The breadcrumb bar has worked well for navigation at the top of the File Explorer for years, but this nested folders option offers even more ways to navigate around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI-F_tfre5N0nthEHeXpWMj8r4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445534/d24v4rfao5t61.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alur2020 (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This File Explorer concept also imagines how nested folders would work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="os25cz"&gt;Alur2020’s concept has proved &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/mqsp10/redesigned_file_explorer/"&gt;popular over on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, with hundreds of comments praising the design, thousands of upvotes, and a number of Reddit awards. The concept comes just weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348639/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-new-icons-system-update"&gt;Microsoft unveiled new File Explorer icons&lt;/a&gt; as part of a larger visual overhaul for Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ON73aX"&gt;Microsoft has also created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10 this year, as part of a planned “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” codenamed “Sun Valley.” The company is expected to detail its Windows UI plans and more about the future of the OS in the coming months as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;dedicated news event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Experience now optimizes settings for creative apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_dC01ffSimR3w9c8JJfjka0CuM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129299/NVIDIA_Studio_Optimal_Settings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ua1U8O"&gt;Nvidia has &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/14/studio-gtc-apr-14/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new feature for its GeForce Experience software that helps users of creative applications make sure they’re getting the best performance out of their GPUs. GeForce Experience can now tell you whether you have the best settings enabled for more than 30 creative apps including DaVinci Resolve, Adobe’s Lightroom and Illustrator, and Autodesk’s AutoCAD. If certain GPU features aren’t active, you can turn them on from within GeForce Experience itself “with a single button press.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wdtG3"&gt;For example, DaVinci Resolve users can automatically optimize settings for GPU acceleration in various modes, which may or may not have been switched on already. The idea is that GeForce Experience can now be a central hub for creative apps that helps you maximize performance. Nvidia isn’t doing anything specific here to actually improve how the apps work — though it is also releasing a new Studio Driver today for creative software — this is just a convenient way to make sure that you’ve set them up in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlyN5F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia focuses further on creators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2aIAAX"&gt;GeForce Experience is an application for Nvidia GPU owners that’s usually associated with gaming-related functionality. For example, Nvidia releases “Game Ready Drivers” through GeForce Experience that optimizes new games for its GPUs, and the application can serve as a launcher for those games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3qs7R"&gt;With this move, the software is further expanding its focus to encompass creative users as well, which is an area that Nvidia continues to concentrate on. Earlier today the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383572/open-broadcaster-software-obs-nvidia-noise-removal-rtx-voice-broadcast"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that its RTX-powered audio noise removal feature would be directly integrated into Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), the popular streaming software.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang and Olufsen’s latest speaker disappears into your bookshelf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuFnBC2uAegi9TLsdcL8eDwFkh8=/0x1:1920x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69129265/Beosound_Emerge_0037.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emerge’s design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXyBDB"&gt;Bang and Olufsen’s latest connected speaker is the Emerge. Its thin form-factor should blend right in to most bookshelves, and that’s no accident. In a press release &lt;a href="https://press.bang-olufsen.com/d/gKpSDxqk8eyT/news#/april-2021/bang-olufsen-introduces-beosound-emerge-an-incredibly-slim-yet-powerful-home-speaker"&gt;announcing the speaker&lt;/a&gt;, the company says its design was “inspired by the compact form factor of a book” with side panels that wrap around like a cover, and a logo on the front that’s meant to evoke a title printed on the spine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seJuu6"&gt;It’s a nice contrast from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9470909/40000-speaker-bang-olufsen"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of Bang and Olufsen’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17795192/bang-olufsen-edge-speaker-price-release-date-ifa-2018"&gt;previous speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have had huge, hulking form-factors that are hard to imagine in any normal home. Instead, the Emerge takes a similar approach to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;Ikea’s Symfonisk speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have pulled double duty as lamps or shelving to help them blend in with the rest of your furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ej1XNnSteAinXaMG66GaGIq6uyY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445488/Beosound_Emerge_0041.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get it? Like a title on a book spine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jM8rD4"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the Emerge speaker’s small form-factor shouldn’t make it a slouch in the sound quality department, however. “The vision for Beosound Emerge was to create the slimmest speaker possible that could still deliver full range, ultra-wide sound despite its size through its revolutionary driver configuration,” says the company’s head of product management Christoffer Poulsen. Internally there’s a triple-driver configuration consisting of a 4-inch woofer, a 1.45-inch mid-range, and a 0.6-inch tweeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ5ETC"&gt;In terms of connectivity, the Emerge supports all the standards you’d expect out of a modern connected speaker. There’s Spotify Connect support, Bluetooth 5.0, Airplay 2, and Chromecast streaming, as well as a built-in microphone with Google Assistant support. Physical connections include a line-in/optical jack, Ethernet, and a USB-C port for power. And yes, you can pair two Emerge’s together to create a stereo pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snGSOu"&gt;B&amp;amp;O says the speaker uses the same replaceable connectivity module that appeared in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264409/bang-and-olufsen-beosound-level-modular-streaming-smart-speaker-bluetooth-airplay"&gt;recent Beosound Level&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow it to receive “new performance updates and features for years to come.” Eventually this module can be replaced if it gets outdated, B&amp;amp;O says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGB7po"&gt;The Bang and Olufsen Emerge is available in select European markets starting today, and will release globally this autumn. Pricing starts at £539 / €599 9around $717) for the black model, while the gold model which has an oak wood cover costs slightly more at £669 / €749 (around $879).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can finally ‘inquire to buy’ LG’s rollable TV in the United States</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UBIzWt"&gt;We may never see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;LG’s incredible rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; come to market, now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;its smartphone days are done&lt;/a&gt;, but at least the rollable TV we’ve been eagerly tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866060/lg-display-rollable-oled-tv-65-inch-ces-2018"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; is finally making it to the United States. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Flg-signature%2Frollable-oled-tv-r&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22384789%2Flg-rollable-tv-usa-united-states-price-release-date-availability" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can now “inquire to buy” one&lt;/a&gt; at the company’s website, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://hdguru.com/lg-quietly-fielding-inquiries-in-u-s-for-rollable-oled-r-tvs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HD Guru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-rollable-oled-r-available-us-222137792.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98g18O"&gt;While the company doesn’t list a price, we highly doubt you’ll nab one for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054005/lg-rollable-oled-4k-tv-shipping-price-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;the $60,000 originally promised&lt;/a&gt;; the motorized TV-in-a-box &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;went on sale in South Korea&lt;/a&gt; last October for 100 million won, or over $89,000 in today’s US dollars. We also wouldn’t be surprised if you have to pay for more than just the TV itself, seeing how we reached the voicemail of a “custom integration specialist” when we called the provided number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijQ78S"&gt;While the rollable TV will be quite the conversation piece, you should also know it’s a couple years behind the times when it comes to certain specs and image processing. Then again, if you’re the kind of person who can afford one, you can probably retire to the bedroom when you crave more power, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/27/21723138/samsung-98-inch-tv-deal-sale-black-friday-8k"&gt;your 98-inch 8K set&lt;/a&gt; is no doubt ready to embrace you with every one of its 33 million pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Goodbye, funky hacks: you’ll soon be able to download albums on the Spotify desktop app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biwCHYYymRmaLMwyZlMKgHrfxxg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69127866/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI2zLe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-25/introducing-a-new-spotify-experience-across-desktop-app-and-web-player/"&gt;Spotify’s desktop app refresh&lt;/a&gt; seems to be rolling out to users, and it brings with it a very handy feature: album downloads. The app has supported downloading playlists to your computer for quite a while. The update should make it easier to keep your library managed if you want to keep the music going even when you’re offline. It is worth noting that this feature is limited to Premium subscribers — according to Spotify’s documentation, free users are only able to download podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PukiGg"&gt;Downloading an album works similarly to downloading a playlist: just navigate to the album’s page and press the download button. It should then be available the next time &lt;a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/listen-offline/"&gt;you go into Offline mode&lt;/a&gt;. This should make it easier to manage your offline library if you’re the type of person who’s very particular about what you want to listen to. (For example, I had a carefully curated playlist called “Downloads” that I would dump songs and albums into as a workaround to not being able to save individual things for offline listening.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pcd0e7zo3xrpiKlsp_bvUkhnkbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444463/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now I can download individual albums and set my Downloads playlist free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVmau"&gt;The update also features tweaks to the look of the desktop and web player, as well as how playlist management works. It appears to be currently rolling out — some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff got it yesterday, others today. So if you’re not seeing it, just hang tight. You should see a screen letting you know that you’ve got the update.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A74ZJo4uGApYH1E0e467pzs6g1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444480/image__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who doesn’t love offline use?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
