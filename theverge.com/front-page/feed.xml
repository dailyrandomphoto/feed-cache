    <title>SpaceX is about to send a second Dragon capsule to the space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRxxnM0QsuRkmAHctjLJPxFBzHE=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68466117/CRS21_rollout_DSC_3152_scaled_1024x683.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Cargo Dragon spacecraft will launch Sunday from Kennedy Space Center&lt;/em&gt; | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRt61C"&gt;This morning, SpaceX is set to launch its latest batch of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station, but the company is using a slightly different spacecraft for this flight than resupply missions of the past. SpaceX is flying its newly upgraded Dragon capsule to transport the goods to space — the same vehicle that the company has been using to fly astronauts to the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcVz1Z"&gt;SpaceX has been resupplying the space station since 2012, and for all of its 20 previous missions, the company has used the original version of its Dragon cargo capsule. SpaceX started developing a new Dragon capsule, though, to transport people to and from the ISS. Called Crew Dragon — or Dragon 2 — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;vehicle carried its first crew to space in May&lt;/a&gt;. With the new version operational, SpaceX decided to discontinue the use of its old Dragon capsule and use the upgraded version to carry both crew &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spQaCZ"&gt;The Dragon 2 capsule sports a number of upgrades over its predecessor; SpaceX says it can carry &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1334502617465069575?s=20"&gt;50 percent more science payloads.&lt;/a&gt; The new Dragon is also capable of automatically docking with the space station. The previous version had to be berthed: it would slowly approach the ISS, while a crew member on board the station would use a robotic arm to grab the incoming capsule and move it onto an open docking port. Dragon 2 doesn’t need any help from humans to dock and attach itself to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eXjHM"&gt;This mission will bring supplies for the station and astronauts, and is also bringing several experiments to the ISS. They include the European Space Agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/09/BioAsteroid"&gt;Bioasteroid,&lt;/a&gt; which will test how biomining— the process of using microorganisms to extract elements from rocks— is affected by microgravity. The mission also will have the first &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/COVID-19_drug_research_and_bio-mining_launching_to_the_International_Space_Station"&gt;COVID-19 drug research experiment&lt;/a&gt; in space on board, to try to improve the efficiency of antiviral drug remdesivir. Also on board will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437672/nanoracks-bishop-commercial-airlock-spacex-international-space-station-satellite-deployment"&gt;Nanorocks’ commercial airlock module&lt;/a&gt;— basically a large metal cup that attaches to the exterior of the ISS— designed to get payloads and other materials from inside the pressurized environment of the ISS out into space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0FBs2T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dcy4yZb13fE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pue6YM"&gt;Once this capsule reaches the space station, it won’t be the only Dragon attached to the ISS. On November 15th, SpaceX launched a crew of four to the ISS on another Dragon capsule, which docked with the station a day later. That means there will be two Dragons docked at the ISS after this flight gets off the ground. “It’ll be the first time that there are two Dragons on the space station simultaneously,” Sarah Walker, the director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said during a press conference ahead of the flight. “And it really ushers in a season of continuous Dragon presence for the near future, at least through the end of 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBEaeW"&gt;The mission was rescheduled due to weather concerns but is now slated to launch at 11:17AM ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SpaceX is using one of its used Falcon 9 rockets for the mission, a vehicle that’s flown three times before. In fact, it’s the same rocket that launched SpaceX’s first crew of two the station in May. After the flight, the Falcon 9 will attempt to land on one of SpaceX’s drone ships in the Atlantic. The Dragon capsule is expected to dock with the ISS on December 7th. You can &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/index.html"&gt;watch the launch live on SpaceX’s website here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s Chang’e 5 completes docking mission on its way back to Earth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jj58S2"&gt;China’s Chang’e-5 mission completed a tricky docking maneuver on Saturday, as it prepares to return the soil samples it collected from the Moon’s surface back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f24fkD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594565/china-change-5-mission-lunar-sample-return-long-march-5-launch"&gt;Chang’e 5 launched on November 23rd&lt;/a&gt; atop a Long March 5 rocket, with four main spacecraft. The mission entered the lunar orbit on November 28th, and its lander and ascent vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21724067/china-lunar-mission-change-5-moon-soil-samples"&gt;landed on the Moon December 1st&lt;/a&gt;, while its service module remained in lunar orbit. The lander gathered rocks and soil, and on Saturday, docked in orbit with the service module. Those samples will now be put in a return capsule for the trip home, expected to land in Inner Mongolia later in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KiC6c9"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WB7JIs"&gt;If the mission is successful, it will make China only the third country to return samples from the Moon, more than 50 years after the US Apollo missions. The last successful lunar sample return mission was the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLWMtW"&gt;Also on Saturday, Japan’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155825/jaxa-hayabusa2-mission-asteroid-sample-return-landing-australia"&gt;Hayabusa2 mission landed in the Australian desert&lt;/a&gt;, after retrieving samples of the Ryugu asteroid. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla diversity report shows its US leadership is 59 percent white and 83 percent male </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2UMRBia2lDuNYoSYIT-bim0P8s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68464002/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BBgUYr"&gt;Tesla published its first-ever diversity report on Friday, which shows the automaker’s US leadership is 83 percent male, and 59 percent white. The &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/us-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-report"&gt;Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Impact report&lt;/a&gt; shows that men represent 79 percent of Tesla’s workforce, and women 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s92IPH"&gt;“While women are historically underrepresented in the tech and automotive industries, we recognize we have work to do in this area,” the report states. “Increasing women’s representation at all levels, especially in leadership, is a top priority in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMJNJx"&gt;The company also acknowledges in the report that Black employees are underrepresented— only 10 percent of the workforce and 4 percent of leadership at Tesla are Black or African-American. “We know that our numbers do not represent the deep talent pools of Black and African American talent that exist in the US at every level,” the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AOAAF"&gt;The company says Black and African-American employees made up 12 percent of new hires at the company in 2020, which is a 9 percent increase from 2019. It plans to conduct more recruitment at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and provide its managers and recruiters with unconscious bias training, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cj6A3"&gt;Asian employees make up 21 percent of Tesla’s workforce and 25 percent of company leadership, and Hispanic or Latino/Latina employees represent 22 percent of its total workforce, but only 4 percent of leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRS0jg"&gt;Tesla’s report is somewhat incomplete, however; it does not detail attrition or retention rates at the company, or provide details about how many of its employees identify as non-binary or gender nonconforming, or, how many identify as having a disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNfKni"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japan’s asteroid sample return mission lands in Australian desert</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DNxKvpCiKorUAr8jpoBSC7D1Vzg=/0x101:2500x1768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68463766/Reentry_capsule_20_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of Hayabusa2’s sample capsule landing on Earth&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JAXA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1cExQ8"&gt;After spending six years in space, a Japanese spacecraft just landed in the desert of southern Australia, bringing a small cache of asteroid rocks to the surface of Earth. It’s only the second time in history that materials from an asteroid have been returned to our planet. Eventually, scientists will open the spacecraft up, uncovering the precious rocks within to learn more about the asteroids that permeate our Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vD89BN"&gt;The landing is the culmination of Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission, aimed at bringing samples of an asteroid back to Earth. After launching from Japan in 2014, the Hayabusa2 spacecraft spent four years journeying to an asteroid named Ryugu. The vehicle spent a year and a half hanging around the asteroid, mapping the rock’s surface and grabbing samples of material before heading back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="teSn4G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientists are eager to see the rocks that Hayabusa2 has returned&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbETnX"&gt;Scientists are eager to see the rocks that Hayabusa2 has returned, as pristine samples from an asteroid could tell us a lot more about what our Solar System was like when the planets were first forming. That’s because asteroids are a bit like baby pictures of our cosmic neighborhood. These space rocks have been around since the dawn of the Solar System, and scientists believe asteroids haven’t really changed much over the last 4.6 billion years. These objects contain many of the same materials that were present at the Solar System’s birth, so studying these rocks in labs here on Earth could provide key context about the early days of the planets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAXA mission controllers celebrating the successful capsule separation of Hayabusa2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YXgCBm"&gt;The capsule will be transported to Japan, where we’ll learn how much asteroid material the mission gathered. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which oversees the mission, hoped to bring back 100 milligrams of material from Ryugu, but scientists didn’t have a way to measure how much sample Hayabusa2 had collected while in space. That exact amount will be revealed when the spacecraft is opened in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DS6IWS"&gt;Hayabusa2 used some creative techniques for collecting its samples at Ryugu. Equipped with a small horn-shaped arm, the spacecraft first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234782/jaxa-hayabusa-2-ryugu-asteroid-sample-return-mission"&gt;tapped the asteroid with this appendage in February of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. When the arm made contact, it shot out a bullet-like projectile that punctured the asteroid, releasing a whole mess of dust and pebbles that hopefully went up into the horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="B7JyYD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The spacecraft didn’t just make one sample grab at Ryugu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGDkhp"&gt;The spacecraft didn’t just make one sample grab at Ryugu, though. Hayabusa2 tried this maneuver again in July of 2019, but the spacecraft had done a bit of excavating first. Before &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+verge+hayabusa2&amp;amp;oq=the+verge&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i59l2j0j69i60l2.1277j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;tapping the asteroid a second time&lt;/a&gt;, the spacecraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18295964/japan-spacecraft-asteroid-ryugu-hayabusa2-sci-explosion-crater"&gt;dropped a can of explosives onto Ryugu&lt;/a&gt;, blasting a crater on the asteroid and revealing some of the rocks located just below the surface. Hayabusa2 then tapped the surface inside this crater to scoop up some of this newly exposed material. The goal was to gather even more pristine rocks from Ryugu. The material underneath the asteroid’s surface hasn’t been exposed to the harsh environment of space for billions of years like the rocks on the exterior, which have likely experienced some change and reactions over time. So the material from the crater could provide an even better snapshot of the materials that were present when the Solar System first formed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MDtd8zW7NA6_NLeRAqHQiBT_Ee8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14163064/26062018_Hayabusa2_Mascot_Rueckansicht_xl.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kACHjV"&gt;Once the Hayabusa2 team felt confident they had grabbed enough from Ryugu, the spacecraft left the asteroid in November of 2019. After spending the last year traveling to Earth, the spacecraft deployed a small capsule late Friday night, with the samples of Ryugu located inside. The capsule then set on a course for Earth, plunging through our planet’s atmosphere this morning. It then deployed a parachute, slowing the vehicle from about 12 kilometers per second, or nearly 27,000 miles per hour, so that it could land gently in the  Woomera Prohibited Area in southern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tcyqtq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;teams from JAXA will go on an extended search in Australia to find the capsule&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4OOjV"&gt;After it hit the ground teams from JAXA went on &lt;a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20201204_ts4/"&gt;an extended search in Australia to find the capsule&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle came down in an area that covers 100 square kilometers, or around 38 square miles. It also landed at nighttime in Australia, making the capsule even more difficult to spot. Fortunately, the capsule was equipped with a radio beacon that &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.slack.com/archives/DRQA3DNBT/p1607200317008800"&gt;helped teams locate&lt;/a&gt; where the spacecraft touched down. Before the landing, JAXA teams set up five antennas around the expected landing site to help find the signal, and the agency also had a helicopter with its own beacon receiver to help narrow down the search. A drone was also on hand to fly overhead of the area to take pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANg7pR"&gt;Hayabusa2 is Japan’s second mission to retrieve samples of an asteroid. Its first mission, Hayabusa, returned asteroid samples to Earth in 2010, though the mission only managed to collect tiny grains of asteroid material. Hayabusa2 will hopefully have collected even more than the original Hayabusa’s offerings. And in 2023, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission is expected to return the largest sample of material from an asteroid ever collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t05Sh4"&gt;Though Hayabusa2 has completed its primary mission, the spacecraft isn’t quite done yet. The main spacecraft is still in space and &lt;a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20201116_extMission/"&gt;just set out on a quest to visit another asteroid&lt;/a&gt; called 1998 KY26. It’ll take Hayabusa2 11 years to reach its new target, with the goal of analyzing the space rock and learning even more about the asteroids that zoom around us in space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Timnit Gebru’s actual paper may explain why Google ejected her</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AH83Isg1SKmFF3CA3dzPx15WBCc=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68463594/1028811892.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White / Getty Images for TechCrunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zOuBWr"&gt;A paper co-authored by former Google AI ethicist Timnit Gebru raised some potentially thorny questions for Google about whether AI language models may be too big, and whether tech companies are doing enough to reduce potential risks, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The paper also questioned the environmental costs and inherent biases in large language models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdsCdU"&gt;Google’s AI team created such a language model— &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html"&gt;BERT— in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and it was so successful that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge"&gt;incorporated BERT into its search engine&lt;/a&gt;. Search is a highly lucrative segment of Google’s business; in the third quarter of this year alone, it brought in revenue of $26.3 billion. “This year, including this quarter, showed how valuable Google’s founding product — search — has been to people,” CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21531711/google-alphabet-ad-revenue-youtube-waymo-cloud-search"&gt;Sundar Pichai said on a call with investors&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlYBQg"&gt;Gebru and her team submitted their paper, titled “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” for a research conference. She said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334343577044979712"&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that following an internal review, she was asked to retract the paper or remove Google employees’ names from it. She says she asked Google for conditions for taking her name off the paper, and if they couldn’t meet the conditions they could “work on a last date.” Gebru says she then received an email from Google informing her they were “accepting her resignation effective immediately.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F05ZUL"&gt;The head of Google AI, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;Jeff Dean, wrote in an email to employees&lt;/a&gt; that the paper “didn’t meet our bar for publication.” He wrote that one of Gebru’s conditions for continuing to work at Google was for the company to tell her who had reviewed the paper and their specific feedback, which it declined to do. “Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google,” Dean wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qYAyG6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gebru is known for her work on algorithmic bias, especially in facial recognition technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lf76oL"&gt;In his letter, Dean wrote that the paper “ignored too much relevant research,” a claim that the paper’s co-author Emily M. Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington, disputed. Bender told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that the paper, which had six collaborators, was “the sort of work that no individual or even pair of authors can pull off,” noting it had a citation list of 128 references. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG2mKU"&gt;Gebru is known for her work on algorithmic bias, especially in facial recognition technology. In 2018, she co-authored a paper with Joy Buolamwini that showed error rates for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;identifying darker-skinned people were much higher&lt;/a&gt; than error rates for identifying lighter-skinned people, since the datasets used to train algorithms were overwhelmingly white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvc9tx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/"&gt;Gebru told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; in an interview&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday that she felt she was being censored. “You’re not going to have papers that make the company happy all the time and don’t point out problems,” she said. “That’s antithetical to what it means to be that kind of researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fxl13"&gt;Since news of her termination became public, thousands of supporters, including more than 1,500 Google employees have signed a letter of protest. “We, the undersigned, stand in solidarity with Dr. Timnit Gebru, who was terminated from her position as Staff Research Scientist and Co-Lead of Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) team at Google, following unprecedented research censorship,” reads the &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;petition, titled Standing with Dr. Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zORzgt"&gt;“We call on Google Research to strengthen its commitment to research integrity and to unequivocally commit to supporting research that honors the commitments made in Google’s AI Principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPlM8q"&gt;The petitioners are demanding that Dean and others “who were involved with the decision to censor Dr. Gebru’s paper meet with the Ethical AI team to explain the process by which the paper was unilaterally rejected by leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iULwK2"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjMxfB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leftovers you can’t eat: Black Friday deals you can still get</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0G_u3DPUQg__QirbpSVS1jdIyI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68463022/IMG_0625-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;This weekend, you can enjoy the last of the leftovers — not Thanksgiving leftovers. (There’s still no end in sight for those at my house.) I’m talking about the deals left over from Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s a relative drought compared to the number of sales we saw last weekend in the thick of it all, but you can still get some of this year’s best prices on headphones, video games, and smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czy1ds"&gt;Here are this week’s best deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OiHIXW"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="of9IqM"&gt;Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CpGTxi"&gt;The headphones with arguably the most effective noise cancellation tech and best sound quality for the price are the Sony WH-1000XM4. They were down to $278 during Black Friday, but their current $298 price is still a good buy if you missed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zda7L8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9523565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4JS17"&gt;The price of the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live is back down to the Black Friday deal we saw last week. At Woot, they cost $110, matching the lowest price yet, and you can have at your choice of color. These will arrive by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wo6p68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="u7ze3L"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="INGUDX"&gt;Smart speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OjwoAb"&gt;The Sonos One (gen 2) is $40 off its original $200 price at Best Buy, Amazon, and through Sonos itself. This model features microphones for smart assistant support (Google Assistant, Alexa), and it’ll work alone or connected via Wi-Fi to other Sonos speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zUvJQQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741320"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5iOMh"&gt;Amazon’s new lineup of Echo smart speakers that released this fall has received some big discounts lately, and perhaps the most appealing from a value perspective is the spherical Echo Dot for $29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="39vJ5l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="A2ey4u"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3ooamK"&gt;Video games&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRjaCpdNZS-Z545s1XVCsD1Oetc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21920671/XGP_EAPlay_HERO.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WeihPa"&gt;If you haven’t yet signed up for Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft is offering a three-month subscription to the Game Pass Ultimate service (combining Xbox Live, Game Pass for console, PC, and Android via xCloud) &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate%2Fcfq7ttc0khs0%3Ficid%3DXboxDealsCat_TopStripe_GamePassUltimate%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $1 through its site&lt;/a&gt;. Since EA Play joined Game Pass, there are now even more games to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yybE71"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is down to $35 for the PS4 and Xbox One at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-Day-Ichi-PlayStation/dp/B0886YWLC9?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=99&amp;amp;imprToken=58bb126e-a667-93af-b3a&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21347150%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/users%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2F-%2F6413105.p%3Fu1%3D%255B%255Dvg%255Be%255D21347150%255Br%255Dtheverge.com%252Fusers%255Bt%255Dw%255Bd%255DD&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The Xbox One copy will grant you a free upgrade to the Xbox Series X / S version if you own one of Microsoft’s next-gen consoles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wRyarN"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21347150%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/users%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-4/games/products/fifa-21/11102805.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;/em&gt; is $25 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt; (usually $60), the lowest it’s been. If you buy the PS4 version and upgrade to the PS5, you will receive the next-gen version free of charge until &lt;em&gt;FIFA 22&lt;/em&gt; releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk reportedly plans to move to Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Awarded With Axel Springer Award In Berlin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-Y0LsGYapj9TAWrOlkjLab1p4=/0x19:5333x3574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68462958/1229892934.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Britta Pedersen-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFSxTo"&gt;Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is planning to move from California to Texas, a move that would potentially save him from a huge personal income tax bill, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-plans-to-move-to-texas-friends-and-associates-say.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4q4qM"&gt;Musk announced in July that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y"&gt;Tesla was building its next US factory in Austin,&lt;/a&gt; where it will produce its Cybertruck, Model Y, Model 3, and Semi vehicles. The company received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323977/austin-tesla-tax-breaks-travis-county-cybertruck-factory-incentives"&gt;tens of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in local property tax breaks to build the plant on 2,100 acres east of Austin’s airport, over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21300909/tesla-austin-cybertruck-gigafactory-elon-musk-tax-breaks"&gt;objections of some local residents&lt;/a&gt;. The factory is expected to begin delivering its first vehicles in 2021. Musk’s Boring Company already has operations in Austin, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/29/20889605/spacex-elon-musk-starship-rocket-update-pictures-mk1"&gt;SpaceX has a facility&lt;/a&gt; in Boca Chica, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqqtY0"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239554148724737"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he was “selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdEzEx"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201651/tesla-fremont-factory-covid-19-coronavirus-shutdown-shelter-in-place"&gt;battled with officials in California&lt;/a&gt; in recent months over pandemic lockdown orders that temporarily shuttered Tesla’s Fremont plant. In May, Musk said he was going to move the automaker out of state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fVNyf5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259162367285317633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6r6hxP"&gt;In November, Tesla said employees at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587781/tesla-workers-california-fremont-exempt-new-covid-19-order-newsom"&gt;Fremont plant were “essential workers”&lt;/a&gt; and exempt from California’s new statewide COVID-19 health orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S52fn4"&gt;If Musk does change his permanent address to Texas, he’d pay significantly less in taxes, as &lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;notes. Musk stands to earn more than $50 billion in stock options, and would have to pay income taxes on the profits when he exercises them if he remained in California. Texas, however, has &lt;a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.8.htm"&gt;no personal income tax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGfZYh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preparation for a big COVID-19 vaccine rollout is underway </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Training At The Covid-19 Vaccination Clinic In Coventry" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2KDfg37tVICKwDmPoCZftxrsYP4=/0x184:4597x3249/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68462898/1229942180.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dX1uMk"&gt;In the US, COVID-19 vaccines are just around the corner, leaving the entire country peering out the window in anticipation of their arrival. Officials and healthcare systems, already taxed by &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/12/the-worst-case-scenario-is-happening-hospitals-are-overwhelmed/617301/"&gt;skyrocketing case counts&lt;/a&gt; are making sure that everything is prepared when they show up. Here’s a few things still on their vaccine to-do lists: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkwcrj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save the dates: &lt;/strong&gt;In the next few weeks, committees with the Food and Drug Administration will meet to decide whether or not to authorize vaccine candidates for Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna. The Pfizer vaccine is up first, with a meeting &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-december-10-2020-meeting-announcement"&gt;scheduled for December 10th&lt;/a&gt;. Moderna’s &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-announces-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-second-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;meeting will happen a week later, on December 17&lt;/a&gt;. The committee will meet to discuss the mountains of data from the clinical trials, and decide if they are safe and effective enough to be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SADE3U"&gt;While the US is taking some time to do thorough background checks on the vaccines, others have expedited the process. This week, the UK authorized the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/02/u-k-approves-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-putting-pressure-on-fda/"&gt;putting pressure on the US&lt;/a&gt; to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="yjopOK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F3TlO7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seating arrangements: &lt;/strong&gt;Once the FDA has decided which vaccines are invited to the party, states need to have a plan for their allotted doses. Friday, December 5 was the &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/states-submit-vaccine-orders-coronavirus-death-toll-grows-74544381"&gt;deadline for states to place orders for the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this week, a committee of the CDC met to finalize their recommendations as to who should get the vaccine first. The VIPs who are most likely to receive the vaccine first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;are healthcare workers&lt;/a&gt; and people living and working in long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKx8qL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menu planning: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587664/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-two-doses-shots"&gt;As expected&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine front runners are both two dose vaccines, and the vaccines have to be given weeks apart. This is a challenge for states who now have to make sure that everyone gets the right vaccine at the right time. They plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22153908/covid-vaccine-dose-tracking-digital-registry-fda"&gt;use digital databases&lt;/a&gt; to track who got which vaccine, and when they got their shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTBTJb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing out the fridge(s): &lt;/strong&gt;These vaccines have to be kept very cold. They can both stay potent for a while at refrigerator-like temperatures, but for longer-term storage Pfizer / BioNTech’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica"&gt;needs to chill at minus 70 degrees Celsius&lt;/a&gt;. That has states clearing out cold storage and buying up dry ice anywhere they can as they prep for the vaccine’s arrival. In Maine, community college freezers may be pressed into service as the state starts vaccinating more people, the head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/12/maine-covid-vaccine-distribution-plan.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzQw4l"&gt;There’s still a lot more to do before the first doses start trickling in. First on the priority list, there’s a surge of cases and hospitalizations that must be stopped. Then, transparent plans and communications need to set the tone for a vaccine campaign. The vaccines need to be delivered equitably, and researchers will have to keep a watchful eye on the long-term effects of the vaccines. But if all of those can be accomplished, and this hastily-planned vaccine effort can be pulled off, it will be a triumph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f3Ygs"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q1kdm0"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AVg4JD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/small-data-big-implications"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Data, Big Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;How dangerous is it to dine inside a restaurant right now? There’s still a dearth of data, but some fascinating studies are coming out, including a recent one from South Korea, broken down in this article by sociologist Zeynep Tufekci. Tufekci’s newsletter &lt;em&gt;Insight &lt;/em&gt;is worth a read — &lt;a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-pandemic-heroes-who-gave-us-the"&gt;another post this week&lt;/a&gt; highlights the efforts of Chinese researchers to sound the an early alarm on this virus.&lt;br&gt;(Zeynep Tufekci&lt;em&gt;/Insight&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Selena doesn’t have a lot of Selena</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XTbb8q6LxmP_vRfjyOcMHS2cLIo=/0x91:7452x5059/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68462913/Selena_102_Sc41_0055_R3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cesar Fuentes Cervantes / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZ2btE"&gt;There haven’t been many musicians like Selena Quintanilla: she was a Tejano superstar who managed to find major label mainstream success as one of the music industry’s first Latin artists to top the charts. Her dazzling career was cut tragically short when she was murdered by a fan in the spring of 1995, just before her 24th birthday. A 1997 film, &lt;em&gt;Selena&lt;/em&gt;, which starred Jennifer Lopez in the titular role, solidified her legend — anointing her as a pop culture saint and a bridge between cultures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRGn1n"&gt;The real Selena Quintanilla, however, was a complex person with an interior life beyond her star persona and her tragic death. She’s a person whose life is worth diving deeper into, beyond the constraints of a two-hour Hollywood picture. In another world, Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Selena: The Series&lt;/em&gt;, now streaming a nine-episode “Part 1,” might have been that. But the new series isn’t interested in any of this. It’s barely interested in Selena herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zoiPk"&gt;After moving swiftly through her childhood with a premiere showing young Selena (Daniela Estrada) discovering music and her father Abraham’s (Ricardo Chavira) early attempts at getting his other children to form a band around her incredible talent, the Netflix series settles into her teen years — when her dream starts to become a reality. As a teenager, Selena’s (Christian Serratos) career begins in earnest, with her father managing the band she’s settled into with her siblings, Selena y Los Dinos. The series shows her navigating the difficulties of poverty and playing Tejano music while dealing with racism from Americans and skepticism from Mexicans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nta2Wz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selena: The Series&lt;/em&gt; treads familiar ground for anyone who has seen the 1995 film or any story about making it in America as an immigrant. You start small, with an impossible belief in the opportunities this country can provide, and then, with perseverance and a little luck, you get your own slice of the American dream. You prove to the world that your culture is worth celebrating. The series hews very closely to these familiar beats, so much so that it’s less a story about Selena and more one about her father, Abraham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0pneD"&gt;The show makes clear that it’s Abraham’s dashed dreams of having a band of his own that fuels his support of his daughter’s career, his controlling attitude that keeps the band focused but also suffocates his children. His pride and ambition are at the center of most of the show’s conflicts. Selena, for the most part, is just along for the ride. In later episodes, as her star rises, she bemoans the lack of a normal life as touring keeps her from socializing with friends and dating boys. (In fact, she gains the most agency when, late in this clutch of episodes, she decides to date someone against her father’s wishes.) But again: her father is there, giving her arc its friction, and sucking up all the oxygen in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6w6TM3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selena: The Series&lt;/em&gt; isn’t interested in its subject as anything other than a symbol, a prayer candle to keep lit while the rest of the Quintanilla family gets proper narrative treatments. Selena’s sister Suzette (who also serves as an executive producer) begins the show afraid of receding into the background as Selena’s drummer but ends up inspiring fans in her own right. Her brother, A.B., gets significant screen time depicting how he grows as a songwriter and chafes under his father’s leadership. Despite being the ostensible focus of the series, Selena doesn’t get the same space. She’s mostly shown as cherubic: smiling, singing, and ultimately not saying very much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUZXAA"&gt;In her &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; story about the ongoing exploitation of Selena Quintanilla, writer Alex Zaragoza criticizes &lt;em&gt;Selena: The Series&lt;/em&gt; as an extension of the nonstop merchandising of the star’s image and story that has ultimately flattened her identity and remade her into a bland symbol of Latinx success. “The fullness of her identity is in danger of becoming a faded carbon copy of its original self,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp983/netflix-selena-the-series-latinx-exploitation"&gt;writes Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt;, noting that Serratos’ performance reflects this, reading as a performance based on Lopez’s film version of Selena and not the human being herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDdAwy"&gt;The result is a show that feels cheap. The feeling is magnified by a moment in the series’s ninth episode when Suzette makes an innocuous-seeming phone call to a fan to see if she’s willing to run the fan club. It’s a bit of dramatic irony that gives away the game: you know the woman at the other end of the line is going to say yes, just as you know that the show, should it return, will eventually show this particular fan shooting and killing Selena Quintanilla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvn6UJ"&gt;This is the Selena that &lt;em&gt;Selena: The Series&lt;/em&gt; is most interested in: the one you already know, the one forever frozen in time and infinitely marketable. If there’s a more complex Selena to discover in between, you won’t find her here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A cheap tablet is a great entertainment device</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A7 is a good cheap tablet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="waI69m"&gt;I’m here to tell you that cheap tablets are good. I’m not here to tell you that they are the future of computing or will replace your laptop for getting work done. But I will tell you they are great entertainment devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KSiUT"&gt;The best way to experience a cheap tablet is to just install the apps you use for entertainment and relaxation: Kindle, Hulu, Prime Video, HBO Max, Pocket, whatever your vice of choice is. Don’t install or set up things like Twitter, Slack, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; app, email, or anything that’s going to take away from leisure time and suck you into work or the dreaded doomscroll. This is a tablet you buy to watch video and read things, not to try to replace your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8Bfuq"&gt;I’ve been testing Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A7 for the past few months and found that it is an excellent example of a cheap tablet. At $229.99 (and often available for less), it’s much more affordable than an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt;, but it works just as well for watching video and reading books and articles. I’m not one to go around recommending Android tablets — an iPad is objectively better in almost every scenario — but the Tab A7 is surprisingly competent and priced right for its tertiary device status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="67kiX4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10201334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q1TIc8"&gt;The bar for a tablet that is destined to be just a personal entertainment device is actually quite low. It needs an engaging screen with enough resolution so you won’t see individual pixels at a comfortable distance, speakers that aren’t muffled or crackly sounding, and battery life that will let you get through a few movies between charges since you likely won’t be plugging this thing in after every time you use it. It should also be thin and relatively light so you can hold it for long periods without getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amU6qb"&gt;The Tab A7 exceeds all of those metrics. The 10.4-inch 1080p screen is vibrant and colorful, the battery easily goes for 10 hours or more of video, and the quad-speaker system sounds tremendous. It’s surprisingly thin, with a metal chassis that feels stiffer and nicer than the plastic-clad Amazon Fire tablets. There’s just enough bezel around the screen so I can comfortably handle it without worrying about errant touches, and it’s light enough so I can even hold it in one hand for reading. It even has a 3.5mm headphone jack for when you don’t want to disturb anyone else while watching the seventh episode of &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptFyJqGKeM-kK1VSFj_lYQ31YnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22024669/dseifert_201107_4280_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab A7’s display is great for watching movies and TV shows, and the four speakers put out surprisingly excellent sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BNn3Bd"&gt;Where the Tab A7 comes short won’t be a surprise, but none of its faults stop it from being a good entertainment device. Its low-midrange Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor and 3GB of RAM make it far from the fastest or snappiest device around — but that doesn’t matter when you’re using the video or ebook app of your choice. Its cameras suck, but on the other hand, if you do use it for a Zoom call, it’s way less awkward than an iPad, thanks to the correct placement of the front camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKRJTC"&gt;Android doesn’t have nearly the breadth or depth of apps as the iPad, but it has all of the major streaming video services (save for Apple TV Plus) and all of the book-reading apps you could want. There’s only 32GB of storage in the base model, but it supports microSD card expansion, so it’s easy to add more. Finally, Tab A7 lacks any sort of fingerprint scanner or biometrics login, but since I just use it at home and don’t have any sensitive or work data on it, I’m comfortable disabling the secure screen lock to make it easier to get to binge-watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvo3MXHmbZ37LvpUtH_M3I69A-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22024672/dseifert_201107_4280_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab A7’s metal chassis is thin and stiff and nicer than the plastic you usually find at this price point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PO3SDZoTq1cVcmRbiHGSUcDEMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22024670/dseifert_201107_4280_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yay for USB-C charging and quad speakers. (There are two on the other side.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r84yNt"&gt;Samsung isn’t pushing any productivity features here: it doesn’t come with a stylus, there’s no keyboard case available for it, and it doesn’t have Samsung’s DeX desktop software mode. It doesn’t even have Samsung’s dumber-than-average Bixby voice assistant. (The Google Assistant is available and works just like on any other device.) Instead of spending time and resources developing features most people won’t use, Samsung focused on what matters here: putting the best speakers and perhaps the best display you can get in a tablet at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkS4JD"&gt;And really, that’s all you could want from a tablet like this. It needs to look good, it needs to sound good, and it needs to have the apps with the content you want. The Tab A7 checks all of those boxes and no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hgziOR"&gt;It’s the best anti-doomscrolling gadget you can get this year.&lt;/p&gt;
