    <title>Volkswagen boss joins Twitter with a jab at Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hIQ22k"&gt;Volkswagen Group boss Herbert Diess joined twitter Wednesday, and his first tweet was a light trolling of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SF6FrF"&gt;“Hello @Twitter! I’m here to make an impact with @VWGroup, especially on political issues,” Diess &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1351915219094806529"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “And, of course, to get some of your market shares, @elonmusk – after all, our ID.3 and e-tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzHbwf"&gt;Diess — who last year settled criminal charges related to &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200520-volkswagen-bosses-avoid-trial-over-dieselgate-scandal-with-9-mn-euro-settlement"&gt;his role in the Dieselgate emissions scandal&lt;/a&gt; — was referencing how the first mass-market electric vehicles of its VW and Audi brands performed well in Europe (and &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/german-electric-car-sales-triple-2020"&gt;especially in Germany&lt;/a&gt;) in their debut year, causing Tesla to lose market share on the continent. (To wit, while writing this, Tesla &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/20/tesla-drops-model-3-prices-in-europe/"&gt;dropped prices on the Model 3&lt;/a&gt; in Europe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O0ot70"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitter&lt;/a&gt;! I’m here to make an impact with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VWGroup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VWGroup&lt;/a&gt;, especially on political issues. And, of course, to get some of your market shares, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; – after all, our ID.3 and e-tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions!&lt;/p&gt;— Herbert Diess (@Herbert_Diess) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1351915219094806529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iQiphG"&gt;Most automotive and other big-brand CEOs use Twitter in an obligatory manner. They issue stately comments on new products or initiatives but are otherwise absent from the daily churn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTnEZr"&gt;It’s hard to imagine Diess — who &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/tesla-is-paving-the-way-and-we-appreciate-that-vw-ceo-says.html"&gt;has praised Musk in the past&lt;/a&gt; — doing much else beyond tweeting playful jabs like the one on Wednesday, let alone actually engaging Musk on his terms with memes and snark and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244136/elon-musk-tesla-stock-price-too-high-fall-tweet"&gt;stock price-moving jokes&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, Diess &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-volkswagens-50-billion-plan-to-beat-tesla-short-circuited-11611073974"&gt;just barely survived&lt;/a&gt; a major power struggle that played out inside the Volkswagen Group. While he remains the top boss, he was stripped of his title of CEO of the VW brand in large part because of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess"&gt;major software problems&lt;/a&gt; the ID 3 has had during its rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctIsg6"&gt;Stranger things have happened, but the idea that Diess — who apparently once made his executives attend a “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-volkswagens-50-billion-plan-to-beat-tesla-short-circuited-11611073974"&gt;syntegration workshop&lt;/a&gt;” — would break edgelord seems unlikely. Musk, meanwhile, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;spent nearly two years possibly violating a court order&lt;/a&gt; that says he’s supposed to have tweets about Tesla pre-screened by a lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb0jMV"&gt;To Musk’s credit, he also spends a lot of his time on Twitter responding to customers who have suggestions or complaints about Tesla’s products. In fact, this has become such a critical pipeline that Tesla’s energy division has spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-job-hiring-customer-service-specialist-help-twitter-elon-musk-2021-1"&gt;hiring customer service specialists&lt;/a&gt; who now help field those requests. If Diess learns any lessons about how to use Twitter from Musk, that may be a good place to start given the state of the ID 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhiteHouse.gov now has dark mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the White House website, showing the dark, high contrast mode activated." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKVZ56Tusr2DG23Nb-8RLmxd7XA=/53x0:2231x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695583/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.26.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpyu7d"&gt;The official website of the White House, &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;, has been completely replaced with a new version for the Biden administration, and it comes with some unexpected accessibility features: a high contrast mode, which serves as a dark mode, and a toggle to make the font size larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5fy08"&gt;Both options show up along the left rail as big, easy-to-click or tap buttons, and that’s the way you’ll need to toggle them. Even if your device has a system-wide dark mode, the White House website won’t switch over automatically. That’s because it’s really there to serve as an accessibility feature, meant to help anyone who would have trouble reading or looking at a bright white screen with black text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lszlCD"&gt;With dark mode being very popular among heavy computer users as well, people online were understandably excited to see the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="traket"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;THE WHITEHOUSE WEBSITE HAS DARK MODE I’M LOSING IT. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7kXlBhUXeJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7kXlBhUXeJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sara Ownbey Chipps (@SaraJChipps) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaraJChipps/status/1351942085952352260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiU2dn"&gt;The large text mode — no surprises — makes the text on the site significantly larger, while still preserving the layout, something that may not be true when using a browser’s built-in zoom ability. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The White House site showing with a dark background, large buttons and text" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/di7-VoZuqQ1ssqFH2UuGjSD49QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247885/Screen_Shot_2021_01_20_at_9.31.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site in both high contrast and large text mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RJ0jUs"&gt;Acting as a recruiting tool for anyone who’s looking into the site’s code, the HTML header also makes a callout to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5992087/us-digital-service-created-to-prevent-tech-debacles-like-healthcare-gov"&gt;the US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt;. The group, led by a former Google engineer, is tasked with making sure US government websites are as good as any of the other ones we visit on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A zoomed-in screenshot showing the high-contrast and large font size toggle buttons" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/edOHhO4Vr1p3JZreY9jzQExEOVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247932/bidens_buttons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are the buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TSQ7SU"&gt;While the previous &lt;a href="http://Whitehouse.gov"&gt;WhiteHouse.gov&lt;/a&gt; site wasn’t a trainwreck by any means (at least technically speaking), it’s good to see that the new administration is taking accessibility and digital competency seriously from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pOyaoY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>As promised, Twitter made Joe Biden’s @POTUS account start with zero followers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President-Elect Biden Announces Climate And Energy Appointments" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4j0dv15QIpD4QXNU2d20VAqEFrk=/0x0:4461x2974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568163/1230220167.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joshua Roberts / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="22XJ2G"&gt;President Biden is going to need some Twitter followers. Twitter wiped out all followers from the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse accounts once Biden was sworn in, today, January 20th, rather than transferring the accounts’ existing followers over to the new administration. That’s what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Flaherty/status/1341406581901189120"&gt;what Rob Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;, Biden’s digital director, said would happen in late December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVImpc"&gt;Here’s the full list of changes today, according to Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EszzjG"&gt;Trump administration Twitter accounts are now publicly archived and include: @POTUS45, @WhiteHouse45, @VP45, @PressSec45, @FLOTUS45 and @SecondLady45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOGeo9"&gt;Accounts for the White House, President, Vice President, First Lady and White House Press Secretary have now inherited their new institutional usernames:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rFWCo"&gt;@Transition46 has become @WhiteHouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npleHr"&gt;@PresElectBiden has become @POTUS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JPcjU"&gt;@SenKamalaHarris has become @VP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSYLkJ"&gt;@FLOTUSBiden has become @FLOTUS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBDOQn"&gt;@PressSecPsaki has become @PressSec&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSL36h"&gt;A new account, @SecondGentleman, is also live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0UV7uusJShqRVlRsG7zbR-I_Cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247821/chrome_OUvfJZd9r4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kykL_2GGDeDonEc8FPatTEZ1KDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247820/chrome_gzBTjyadMK.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-F59RzXeGt8N5dPJir6nkjUSBPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247841/chrome_I2YleCzF2R.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BXBjVn"&gt;Twitter said in December that the accounts for @VP, @FLOTUS, @PressSec, @Cabinet, and @LaCasaBlanca would also have their followers wiped. As you can see in the images above, the @POTUS, @VP and @WhiteHouse accounts are quickly accumulating new followers. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-will-face-different-twitter-rules-when-he-leaves-office-11608642198?st=qipqi5w4hwb57f8&amp;amp;reflink=share_mobilewebshare"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that there was originally contention between the Biden camp and Twitter over whether followers would transfer over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4uztq"&gt;This is a reversal from what Twitter did in 2017 when the Trump administration took over accounts from the Obama administration. Back then, Twitter essentially duplicated the existing accounts, creating an archive of Obama-era tweets and followers and building a new set of accounts for the incoming administration that retained all of those followers without any of the tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CpbWbf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration will miss out on tens of millions of followers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Twitter didn’t say why it changed the policy this time. Twitter told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it is “in ongoing discussions with the Biden transition team on a number of aspects related to White House account transfers.” Biden’s team seems to be unhappy about this change in policy, given the significant digital advantage they’ll be losing. Flaherty said the transition team “pushed back and we were told this was unequivocal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kd95gK"&gt;On Inauguration Day, anyone who follow one of the handles being transitioned will receive a notification that the account is being archived, a Twitter spokesperson said in December. They will also be given the option to follow the Biden administration’s new accounts. There are no details yet on what that notification will look like for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S903OI"&gt;While the president has plenty of pulpits to speak from, there’s no denying that Twitter is a major communications tool for the president after these last four years. Those accounts have significant followings to rebuild, too: @POTUS had 33 million followers, @WhiteHouse had 26 million, @FLOTUS had 16 million, and @PressSec had 6 million as of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhhCN0"&gt;Donald Trump’s @POTUS account will be renamed @POTUS45 and “frozen as-is,” the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported. He would have originally been in control of @realDonaldTrump, albeit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;with fewer protections&lt;/a&gt; than before, if Twitter had not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned him for inciting violence on January 8th.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO2Whc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 5:23PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with new details from Twitter on the transition of accounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPgpWx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 20th at 12:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter has now transitioned the Presidential accounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The fight to make Netflix and Hulu pay cable fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExsAnHfpS9xaAy88BMhiS4KDd8E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695312/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNr9a"&gt;Streaming services are slowly turning into cable TV — complete &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168484/disney-streaming-bundle-ad-free-hulu-disney-plus-espn-price-release-date"&gt;with bundles&lt;/a&gt;, an ever-growing list of channels, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21291519/justwatch-streaming-search-engine-filter-app-impressions-hbo-max-disney-plus-netflix-hulu"&gt;reinvented TV guide&lt;/a&gt;. And a series of lawsuits could portend the return of something even worse: the hidden cable fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5Jn1W"&gt;Three municipalities in Georgia are &lt;a href="https://media.bizj.us/view/img/11934567/gwinnett-vs-netflix-1.pdf"&gt;suing Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming video providers&lt;/a&gt; for as much as 5 percent of their gross revenue in the district — joining a nationwide group of towns and counties that want these services regulated more like cable TV. It’s a small but growing front in the war over cord-cutting, challenging regulators to decide which matters more: the increasing role streaming services play in American media diets or their significant practical differences from traditional TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aD7Efk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Missouri paved the way for pushing streaming franchise fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MSHVcN"&gt;The federal lawsuit, reported &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2021/01/11/gwinnett-netflix-disney-hulu-lawsuit-georgia.html?ana=TRUEANTHEMTWT&amp;amp;csrc=6398&amp;amp;taid=5ffd88444156da0001be218e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;earlier this month by &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Business Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was originally filed in state court last year. It argues that Netflix and Hulu — along with satellite providers Dish Network and DirecTV, as well as Disney’s entertainment distribution division — violated a 2007 law called the Georgia Consumer Choice for Television Act. That rule specifies that “video services” must pay a quarterly franchise fee to local governments, unless they’re part of a larger internet service package or operate wirelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOlQuz"&gt;Georgia isn’t the only place where local towns are pushing for streaming fees. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/why-cash-strapped-towns-are-suing-streaming-giants"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; reported last year&lt;/a&gt;, two law firms recently filed similar suits on behalf of towns in Texas, Indiana, Ohio, and Nevada. And in 2018, the city of Creve Coeur, Missouri paved the way by &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/netflix-tells-court-it-isnt-a-video-service-provider-1143229"&gt;suing Netflix and Hulu&lt;/a&gt; under that state’s franchise laws. With municipal budgets cratered by the pandemic, slapping a franchise fee on cash-heavy tech companies has never been more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trggy9"&gt;A single successful lawsuit could cost these companies millions. Gwinnett County, one of three municipalities named in the suit, charges 5 percent of a company’s local gross revenue in franchising fees. A filing calculates that Netflix made $103 million from Gwinnett County subscribers over the past five years — which would translate to $5.15 million in retroactive fees for that area alone. (Netflix declined to comment on the numbers cited in the story.) The plaintiffs in these cases are seeking class action status, which would make companies liable for any “similarly situated” state locales as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3c1PD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.verizon.com/t5/My-Verizon-Account/What-Is-A-Video-Franchise-Fee/td-p/816103"&gt;TV pr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.comcast.com%2Fhelp-and-support%2Fbilling%2Flearn-more-about-price-changes-on-your-bill&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22238785%2Fgeorgia-lawsuit-netflix-hulu-cable-franchise-fees-video-service#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;oviders&lt;/a&gt; have opted to directly bill subscribers for franchise fees, and companies like Netflix and Hulu could follow their lead, passing the costs to users. Those fees aren’t why &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9276655/cable-bill-high-why"&gt;cable costs so much&lt;/a&gt;, and they help fund important services — but they’re also something many consumers find irritating or bewildering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HNjXp5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All TV is streaming now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvefOt"&gt;If the cases succeed and aren’t preempted by any federal laws, they could draw streaming services — a category that’s exploded in popularity — under a new regulatory umbrella. Even traditional TV providers have moved to online streaming: the suit notes that Dish and DirecTV chose to “fundamentally change” their satellite-only options by adding services like the Dish-owned Sling TV, which routes live TV over broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISp7YI"&gt;The Georgia suit in particular could have broader, potentially unpredictable effects. Its definition seems to potentially encompass many smaller and less profitable streaming video companies, although there’s far less incentive to sue them. Meanwhile, the exemption for internet service packages could give telecom-run streaming offerings — like Comcast-owned NBCUniversal’s Peacock service — a built-in advantage over competitors like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hckL0y"&gt;The Consumer Choice for Television Act wasn’t passed with streaming video in mind. Passed in 2007, the law &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2007/04/09/newscolumn1.html"&gt;amended existing rules&lt;/a&gt; meant for cable TV providers, which pay franchise fees for the right of way to lay wires along public infrastructure like roads. “It’s a remnant of how we did cable franchising,” says John Bergmayer, legal director of the internet-focused nonprofit Public Knowledge. And it specifically exempts some services that don’t require that physical access, like programming from mobile services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7CHWc"&gt;Despite this, the municipalities contend that streaming companies tick the same legal boxes as cable TV. The complaint says people are getting a similar service; in the complaint’s words, they “view professionally produced and copyrighted television shows, movies, documentaries, and other programming.” More technically, it argues that this programming counts as a “video service” because it’s carried over public internet lines that require the right of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AR9UPR"&gt;But conversely, the suit also notes that streaming giants like Netflix aren’t &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;running over a global internet backbone. They’re building local content delivery networks (or CDNs), like Netflix’s Open Connect, which route user traffic &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-box-can-hold-an-entire-netflix-1592590450"&gt;to a nearby server&lt;/a&gt;. Internet service providers in many states — &lt;a href="https://www.govtech.com/network/Georgia-Lawmakers-Grapple-with-Rural-Broadband-Right-of-Way-Rules.html"&gt;including Georgia&lt;/a&gt; — already pay for broadband rights of way, and the servers are located in data centers, not underground pipes or utility poles on public land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9YtLGo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An early January ruling favored fee-seeking cities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J74JLT"&gt;The companies have objected to the string of franchise fee lawsuits. “These cases falsely seek to treat streaming services as if they were cable and internet access providers, which they aren’t,” a Netflix spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They also threaten to place a tax on consumers that the legislature never intended, and we are confident that the courts will conclude that these cases are meritless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwaDxq"&gt;Franchise fee claims — all based on different local laws — remain mostly untested in court. But earlier this month, a Missouri state judge &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/netflix-hulu-cant-hide-behind-internet-tax-freedom-act-in-missouri-fee-fight"&gt;rejected an early bid&lt;/a&gt; to toss that state’s lawsuit, agreeing with the claim that these companies were “video service providers.” The judge specifically noted the presence of CDNs like Open Connect, a system that “bypasses the ‘public internet’” and distinguishes streaming giants from smaller services. She also rejected claims that the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act provided blanket protection from the fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTQjGO"&gt;With little precedent, it may take years to understand the implications of these cases. Companies will likely appeal any decision, and unless the Supreme Court takes up one of the cases, states will be covered under a patchwork of lower court rulings. But an increasing number of local governments see these fees as an opportunity to recover money from the services that are slowly replacing cable TV. “They need money now, and they’ve got this law on the books,” says Bergmayer. With the status of streaming services in flux, they’ve settled on an optimistic approach: “let’s go for it and see what happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61Rc2j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential plus four smart lightbulbs are $30 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14o8aHh6aIxE39Y54qPTHGFu-ks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68695010/dseifert_201030_4273_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rEkGqw"&gt;Last October, Lenovo unveiled its new Google Assistant-powered alarm clock, the Smart Clock Essential. At just $50, the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential is slightly smarter than your average bedside clock. Not only does it display time, weather conditions, and current alarms, but its compact design won’t take up much space on your nightstand or bedside table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atDGZo"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964159341561387" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock Essential is currently $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to take full advantage of Google Assistant and add some smarts to your home, Best Buy is currently offering a bundle that includes the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964099597317249" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock Essential and four C by GE Direct Connect Smart Bulbs for only $30&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X4y1K2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10293534"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4G9VI"&gt;If you are in the market for a new pair of wireless earbuds and do not mind purchasing a refurbished pair, Best Buy is selling a pair of Samsung’s fantastic bean-shaped wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Live, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964564545124958" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for as low as $70&lt;/a&gt; — assuming you want them in white. You can also get them for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964539051709661" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 in bronze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964552565718886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$85 in black&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7QxvN"&gt;If you want a new pair, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Live &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729964625656411002" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $140 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, $30 off its usual price of $170. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AuhBec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10293507"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxALlx"&gt;Last year, publisher 505 Games released a Windows PC version of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;. Although the game was released in 2019 as a PS4 exclusive, my colleague Sam Byford says Hideo Kojima’s latest title is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322476/death-stranding-pc-port-hide-kojima"&gt;worth playing again on a PC&lt;/a&gt;, provided you have a gaming PC that can run the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soTlbA"&gt;If you are interested in picking up the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/death-stranding" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fanatical&lt;/a&gt; is selling digital keys for $24 today and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdeath-stranding-pc%2F#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Green Man Gaming&lt;/a&gt; has marked the game down to $25. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vrbo is blocking new Washington, DC reservations during inauguration week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJdSuZSn_YDioOTYMYv4p5X0_TU=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68691308/Vrbo_logo_dark.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;vrbo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0AxJ2N"&gt;Vrbo has changed its stance on people making reservations in the Washington, DC area during the week of the inauguration. The company announced on January 19th, the day before the event, that it will block any new reservations through Friday, January 22nd. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234501/vrbo-cancel-reservations-washington-dc-inauguration-airbnb-capitol"&gt;Vrbo previously stated it was evaluating new bookings&lt;/a&gt; and that it would “take appropriate action in coordination with law enforcement” if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QW28dL"&gt;The news was tweeted by Expedia Group (which owns Vrbo) and from the official Vrbo Twitter account. It comes in light of DC officials encouraging people to &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/january/headline-891291-en.html"&gt;stay home and participate in the inauguration virtually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XXCZk3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Based on updated guidance provided by government officials regarding security threats, and as part of ongoing efforts to protect the safety of travelers, partners and communities, all new Vrbo reservations will be blocked in and around Washington, D.C. through Friday, 1/22.&lt;/p&gt;— Vrbo (@vrbo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vrbo/status/1351583247260672005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqmXRz"&gt;The company has slowly been changing its policies around inauguration rentals, after &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/vrbo-wont-cancel-inauguration-rentals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported that residents are concerned&lt;/a&gt; about extremists using the service to stay in DC. Vrbo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrbo.com%2Fvacation-ideas%2Fexplore-vrbo%2Ftravel-trends%2Fa-place-for-everyone-leaves-no-room-for-hate&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F19%2F22239269%2Fvrbo-blocking-new-reservations-dc-inauguration#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says in a blog&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “encouraging hosts to cancel bookings” if they believe that the person is there to commit violence, but it’s not blanket-canceling existing reservations. The company does say it’s “re-vetting [them], to help ensure public safety,” but today’s news doesn’t change what Vrbo is doing about people who have already booked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTBi2v"&gt;In comparison, Airbnb not only blocked new reservations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;but it canceled existing ones as well&lt;/a&gt;. On January 6th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExpediaGroup/status/1351050004312559617"&gt;Vrbo stated&lt;/a&gt; that all new reservations would be subject to increased scrutiny and security, but it seems like we’ll just have to trust that those measures were effective, as the new ban seems like it’ll only affect people who are booking last minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBJwBy"&gt;The home-sharing apps are not the only ones trying to avoid more violence in the nation’s capital ahead of tomorrow’s inauguration: Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233871/facebook-blocking-events-white-house-us-state-capitols-inauguration-day"&gt;shut down events near the White House&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have all worked to remove the distribution of Parler, an app that failed to moderate rioters during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236750/propublica-parler-capitol-riot-videos-timeline-resource"&gt;the attack on the Capitol building&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iybqKD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 10:02AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to clarify that hosts are encouraged to cancel reservations if they are concerned about violence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix confirms Shuffle Play feature will officially launch this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MyCj7CRBIvPB_tJDHRAzDvm9u64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68694730/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zSW7Ew"&gt;Netflix’s Shuffle Play feature, which the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374543/netflix-shuffle-play-test-random-tv-movies"&gt;spotted testing last year&lt;/a&gt;, is getting a widespread launch in the first half of 2021. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-shuffle-play-feature-official-launch-1234888490/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; the company made the announcement as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;its latest financial results&lt;/a&gt;. In its testing phase, Shuffle Play has worked by picking content based on your viewing history, helping you avoid feeling overwhelmed by Netflix’s home screen full of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0zbew"&gt;Netflix’s COO and chief product officer Greg Peters said the feature is designed for users to “indicate to us that they just want to skip browsing entirely, click one button and we’ll pick a title for them just to instantly play.” During its tests of the feature, Netflix has experimented with including a “Shuffle Play” button on its profile select screen, and a “Play Something” option in its menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2tjdD"&gt;Here’s how that ended up looking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ANo8F0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Interesting new feature &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@netflix&lt;/a&gt; ... but what kind of insane person just says, “yolo, let’s spin the Netflix wheel of fortune” &lt;a href="https://t.co/6WDJrmd7pG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6WDJrmd7pG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Turner Levison (@TurnerLevison) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerLevison/status/1295543859141844992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6AkRkA3paWUs7Mw10TC_6ohBNLI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21768377/netflix_play_something.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Julia Alexander / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7KNXZC"&gt;The big question now is what Netflix will end up calling the feature. During its earnings presentation, co-CEO Reed Hastings joked that they might call it “I’m Feeling Lucky,” after the Google search feature that skips straight to the top search result. But Peters quickly shot down that idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Br2Asw"&gt;“We’re going to come up with something better than that, so stand by for this. You’ll see it when it rolls out,” Peters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7Ys1r"&gt;Whatever it ends up being called, Shuffle Play will join Netflix’s other recent attempt to make it easier to find content to watch. Last year, it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502772/netflix-new-popular-row-tab-tv-update"&gt;“New &amp;amp; Popular” tab&lt;/a&gt; to the service, which features a combination of new, popular, and upcoming content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVU5fC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izY9ie"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft killed the Zune, but Zune-heads are still here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jC21QaP8dI2BBqZyndcVYfrG-bU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68694078/acastro_210111_4367_zuners_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft may have killed off its flagship MP3 player nearly a decade ago, but these fans are keeping their enthusiasm alive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WkiZ7a"&gt;It was weird to own a Zune in 2005. It is even weirder to own a Zune in 2021 — let alone 16 of them. And yet, 27-year-old Conner Woods proudly shows off his lineup on a kitchen table. They come in all different colors, shapes, and sizes, and each can be identified by that telltale black plastic D-pad just below the screen. He owns the entire scope of the brief Zune lineup — from the svelte Zune 4 to the chunky Zune HD — and among the microscopic community of people who still adore Microsoft’s much-derided MP3 player, no collection of dead tech could possibly be more enviable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywMJsC"&gt;Woods picked up his Zune foraging habit during the pandemic, while he was furloughed from his job working security at Best Buy. “I taught myself to solder, began buying up dead Zunes, and repairing and flipping them for a profit,” he says. “At some point I ran across some rare ones and couldn’t bring myself to part with them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0QZ5h"&gt;He counts a particularly rare model bearing the &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; logo and another with the &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; seal, but to fully understand the depths of Woods’ obsession, you need to look past the gadgets and into the great beyond. Click through his post on the r/Zune subreddit, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/imrh1m/briefly_posted_my_collection_last_week_but_heres/"&gt;wander into his veritable shrine of forgotten Zune detritus&lt;/a&gt;. Woods owns multiple Zune-stamped traveling cases and boombox docks. He has a Zune-branded stress ball as well as a Zune tinderbox, complete with matches that are dyed in the brand’s customary burnt orange and fiery purple. My personal favorite: a Rubik’s cube that, when solved, reveals the Zune’s polyhedral insignia on all of the white squares, as if to say the answer to one of history’s most vexing logic puzzles is, eternally, Zune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CCavs9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s safe to say that a lot of people are here for nostalgia.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgwcZm"&gt;Microsoft spent most of the 2000s a few steps behind Apple. The rival company was perennially a little bit cooler, sleeker, and more tasteful than the endemic squareness of the Gates estate. Often, the Zune was considered the ultimate example of that failure. The product was entirely functional, sure, but for reasons that remain difficult to articulate — the video game insignias, the oversized trackpad, their baffling bulkiness — it was also about a million times less chic than the iPod. (That same inscrutable problem flags Bing, Cortana, the ill-fated Windows Phone, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USnNzx"&gt;But today, almost a decade after Microsoft terminated the brand, there is a small bastion of diehards who are still loving and listening to their Zunes. If you talk to them, they’ll tell you that these MP3 players are the best pieces of hardware to ever run a Windows operating system. Preserving the Zune legacy has just become another part of the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWARLo"&gt;r/Zune has about 4,500 subscribers, and it stands as the only salon left on the internet for those who are pumping life into Microsoft’s most memorable underdog. In the golden days, says Woods, the nation had many other lively forums like “ZuneBoards” and “Zunited.” There has been absolutely no news for Zune-heads since 2011 when Microsoft firmly announced that it was moving on from the MP3 sector indefinitely. And so, most of the posts on the subreddit radiate with a strong wistful ennui in lieu of any firmware updates on the horizon. “My current collection,” writes one poster, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/im5cq1/my_current_collection/"&gt;laying out their four Zunes on a chessboard&lt;/a&gt;, Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky” cued up on the one in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtApyl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/izdt16/120_gb_ssd_modded_my_dads_zune_120_that_he_used/"&gt;Others administer modifications&lt;/a&gt; on their Zunes that push the hardware well past what it was capable of in 2006; like retrofitting an imaginary future where the Zune was not only still around but &lt;em&gt;dominant&lt;/em&gt;. “Started this project in late May, and it’s finally finished,” says Woods, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/htrlp0/started_this_project_in_late_may_and_its_finally/"&gt;in a different post&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that he had successfully added a 128GB SSD to a humble Zune motherboard. Someone else flaunts the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/jltsm9/wireless_charging_on_zune_30/"&gt;wireless charging adapter they added to an ancient Zune 30&lt;/a&gt;. Spend enough time on r/Zune, and you’ll begin to believe that anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GNdN3"&gt;But most often, the denizens here simply want to express to their worldwide comrades that they also haven’t given up on Zune. “It’s safe to say that a lot of people are here for nostalgia,” says John, a 26-year old from San Diego who told me he was first seduced by the Zune in middle school. It’s strange to consider that an abandoned boutique suite of audio hardware is capable of making young men emotional, but then again, I suppose we are only just now discovering how the personal technology boom has impacted our psyche. “Picked up this beauty for $25. I’m pumped!” writes one poster, attached &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/f3lij2/picked_up_this_beauty_for_25_im_pumped/"&gt;to a photo of a prehistoric Zune&lt;/a&gt; sitting calmly next to a whirring Xbox One S. “Just a little Zune porn,” adds another, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zune/comments/ffb77b/just_a_little_zune_porn_trying_to_not_let_the/"&gt;who’s using the hardware’s built-in radio signal to tune into KPBS&lt;/a&gt;. “Trying to not let the flame die out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SbfdDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Zunes were ahead of their time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHTC2T"&gt;One frequent contributor to the forum, 27-year-old Erick Leach, reminds me that, in its heyday, the Zune came equipped with a fairly robust social media appendage: Zune owners could send songs to each other wirelessly and unlock Xbox Live-like achievements for the music they listened to — both novel features in the mid-2000s. The brand never managed to muster the cultural ubiquity of the iPod (Apple attempted its own failed social network, Ping, around the same time), but with that emphasis on community, perhaps it was inevitable for the Zune to eventually mount a cult-like fandom. That’s Leach’s theory, at least. He always felt like there was a massive nation of Zune-heads out there who he would surely meet someday. “That never ended up happening as the Zune died out. But it was wonderful to find the subreddit and see the same passion for the Zune,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDSkCk"&gt;Leach believes the Zune has aged better than people might think. He calls it the best-sounding music player he’s ever used, and he remains in awe of how it decoded a variety of different sound formats. “Artist tabs in the device itself included artist information, photos, recommendations, a robust music store, and free music for Zune Social users,” continues Leach. “It was a device for music lovers who just love music. Simply and effectively.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2o7zaB"&gt;That’s one of the wrinkles you tend to learn after spending time with the Zune Crew, most of them are lifelong audiophiles — the sort of people who get religious about terms like “lossless” and “FLAC.” What’s more, Woods makes the case that the Zune predicted the entire modern music industry as we know it. The Zune Marketplace offered a genuine streaming subscription — long before that became the dominant way people consumed music — which never caught on. “People liked owning their music back then. A paywall for music access seemed odd to people,” he says. “Zunes were ahead of their time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdjzvd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I feel less alone now than I ever did as a Zune user.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sEdK0K"&gt;That, of course, is the connective tissue of r/Zune. As much as its citizenship adores its cherished failed hardware, they congregate on these forums mostly to connect with others who’ve fallen, hopelessly and indefinitely, under the Zune’s baffling enchantment. Woods tells me that solidarity among Zuners has never been stronger. He finds even more thrills in this strange afterlife, as the years have eroded away everyone except for the zealots. “I feel less alone now than I ever did as a Zune user,” finishes Woods. “I feel more involved now than I ever did in the past, and I feel that I have a lot more to contribute now as a ‘seasoned veteran.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DLwFFn"&gt;He can scour the earth in search of every last scrap of Zune memorabilia with the confidence that there will be an audience willing to upvote his efforts indefinitely. He can strap an absurdly huge SSD on the motherboard, ensuring that it will never be replaced. He can post a Zune-stamped coaster, rescued from the deep recesses of the Microsoft trash pile, and trust that his friends will treat the discovery like the Holy Grail. The Zune was mocked, lampooned, and chased out of the market with its tail between its legs. But it never truly died, not with fans like these.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ExpertBook B9450 review: lightweight, long-lasting work laptop</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An ultrathin notebook with fantastic battery life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jDIw4N"&gt;There are two reasons to buy the ExpertBook B9450: the weight and the battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mV4b9Y"&gt;Pick up the Asus ExpertBook B9450, and you’ll wonder where the rest of it is. Asus is touting it as the world’s lightest 14-inch commercial laptop, and it is light. Carrying it around, I felt like I was carrying nothing. My test unit is 2.19 pounds, but models go as low as 1.91 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEBp0H"&gt;Inside the 0.6-inch chassis, though, Asus has still managed to include some decent specs. Models start at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202002AM070000002"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt;, and the base includes 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a Core i7-10510U with Intel’s UHD Graphics 620. The model I’m using, which costs &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Business-Laptop-i7-10510U-Processor-Hrs-Battery-B9450FA-XS79/dp/B0854GGW1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=66d6eb0f691179e8fcddc9af99c3da50&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799&lt;/a&gt;, has the same processor but bumps the storage up to two 1TB drives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9450 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJiAHJY5lGmvKJtlGdW8TWbdOFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236056/mchin_190410_4371_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the keyboard has a lifespan of up to 10,000,000 keystrokes, per its durability testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XDffhl"&gt;But the ExpertBook’s battery life is just as (if not more) impressive than its weight. In my testing, it lasted an average of 10 hours and 47 minutes — and that was while multitasking with a decent load of Chrome tabs and apps at 200 nits of brightness. That means the ExpertBook isn’t the longest-lasting business laptop I’ve ever tested (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;$3,000 Dell Latitude&lt;/a&gt; still holds that crown), but it’s certainly in the hall of fame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M13nBj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10292229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3vAS1I"&gt;That’s my quick take on the ExpertBook. Those are the two standout features (in addition to the storage capacity). Together, they make it a great option for business users who need a portable device with quite a bit of storage, but potential buyers should be aware that the processor is mostly suitable for basic office tasks. More on that in a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Asus ExpertBook B9450." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yg3gFopYQFbJA_5MN1013zvdHvk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236057/mchin_190410_4371_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s too bad all USB-C ports are on the same side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9T3c8o"&gt;A problem with laptops this thin and light is that they sometimes feel flimsy. The ExpertBook is surprisingly sturdy, though; it’s made with multiple layers of a magnesium-lithium alloy material that Asus says is 17 percent less dense than “conventional” magnesium-aluminum alloy. The company also says the B9450 has passed MIL-STD 810G military-grade standards, which tests various factors like port durability, spill resistance, and shock resistance. I’d believe it. While I did feel a bit of flex in the keyboard deck and screen, it was nothing compared to what I’ve seen from other ultrathin units like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21153098/vaio-sx12-review-display-design-price-specs-features"&gt;Vaio SX12&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nZRe0"&gt;Durability aside, the ExpertBook feels very high quality. There are metallic flecks in the finish, which give the whole thing a bit of a celestial look in certain light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAQOl9"&gt;One note with the design: like a number of Asus laptops, the ExpertBook has an ErgoLift hinge, which means the display folds under the keyboard deck when you open the laptop and lifts it a bit off the ground. This has a number of benefits — it’s supposed to increase cooling and make typing more comfortable — but it also means that if you’re using the ExpertBook on your lap, you’ll have a sharp hinge digging into your legs. I know not everyone spends as much time on the couch as I do, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9450 open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays the Asus ExpertBook logo on a blue and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WH6P6GpvPVUBFNiBt2WcPNwRJ4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236059/mchin_190410_4371_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the laptop is unfolded to a 145-degree angle, the bottom rises by 5 degrees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pucLnz"&gt;The final impressive thing is the useful port selection: you’ve got two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, one HDMI 2.0 port, one Micro HDMI to LAN port, and one 3.5mm combo audio jack. Plenty of manufacturers have had trouble fitting even USB-A onto ultrathin machines, so I’m impressed to see a full-sized HDMI here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Asus ExpertBook B9450." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrOarEKYDVN8reuAtiPv2O0jBwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236058/mchin_190410_4371_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HDMI 2.0 port supports 4K video output.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="01XmHG"&gt;Other fun stuff: there’s a fingerprint scanner below the arrow keys, the Windows Hello webcam has both a physical shutter and a kill switch, and the touchpad has Asus’ NumberPad 2.0 feature, which allows you to pull up an LED numpad with the touch of a sensor. And there are a number of business-specific features, including a TPM 2.0 chip and a preloaded suite called Asus Business Manager where you can encrypt your local drives, toggle system registry editing, and customize various other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k58Swh"&gt;All this sounds great, so what’s the catch? There’s really only one, but it’s one that will matter to plenty of people. It’s the processor. The Core i7-10510U is a four-core processor that’s significantly lower-powered than the chips you’ll see in the best laptops on the market like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. It’s far from a workhorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="z3D8iN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10292266"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="j1N6KR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you think you’ll need to do strenuous work on this, you’ll want to look elsewhere&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yLrciZ"&gt;Now, the ExpertBook is just fine for basic office work — emails, Google Docs, Slack, Zoom calls, that sort of thing. I never heard the fans spin up during my regular Chrome multitasking, nor did I experience any performance issues. If this is what you do all day, great — the ExpertBook is for you. But if you think you’ll ever need to do strenuous work on this, especially tasks that leverage the integrated graphics, you’ll want to look elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqVMHG"&gt;I tried to run our traditional video export test in Adobe Premiere Pro to illustrate the performance difference between this model and other ultraportables you can buy, but the program crashed during each trial. I let Asus know about this, and it’s looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ExpertBook B9450 facing away from the canera, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GD718JnrlZ6A70xQegsQPYIIneI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236062/mchin_190410_4371_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid and base panel are made of magnesium-lithium alloy, which Asus says is 17 percent less dense than “conventional” magnesium-aluminum alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VBD23A"&gt;So I ended up running some light games instead. The ExpertBook ran &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;on maximum settings at 40fps (where the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;11th Gen XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; with a Core i7 i7-1165G7 put up 111fps, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;10th Gen XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; with a Core i7-1065G7 put up 70fps). On &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, it averaged 85fps (to the 11th Gen XPS’s 205fps and the 10th Gen’s 160fps). It averaged 31fps on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultra settings and 10fps on the lowest &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; (which I ran mostly out of curiosity). Those frame rates are considerably below what you can expect from both XPS models, as well as plenty of much more affordable 14-inchers like Asus’ own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="NhQFyu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10292267"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hsSMfg"&gt;To reiterate: The ExpertBook isn’t anything close to a gaming laptop. This is just to illustrate the processing power you’re sacrificing for the additional portability, battery life, and storage that the ExpertBook offers (and of course, to note that if you think you’ll ever want to play even casual games, think about getting something else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dvr05W"&gt;One thing I want to commend Asus for, though: The ExpertBook’s cooling is great. During several Premiere export attempts and a long gaming session, the CPU’s temperature stayed very consistently in the high 60s and rarely jumped above 70 degrees Celsius. That’s impressive, especially for such a thin device. (The XPS 13 spends a lot of time in the high 90s.) On the other hand, the fans made so much noise that they were audible from multiple rooms over — people around me would have been alarmed if I tried these tests in an office. That’s another reason to steer clear of this if you’ll need to do gaming or media work from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09Nxan"&gt;The audience for the ExpertBook B9450 is somewhat specific. But that doesn’t mean it’s small. If you’re someone who doesn’t care much about processing power, but does care about portability, battery life, and storage, this laptop is worth the $1,799. Not only is it among the lightest you can buy at this size, but it’s one of few products in its weight class to feature dual storage slots. It’ll be difficult to find all three of those features in many other 14-inch laptops at this price point. Add nice build quality and the nifty numpad feature, and I imagine this is a laptop many at-home and on-the-go workers will be happy to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OLDg8"&gt;Just make sure you know what you’re getting — because the low-powered processor and deafening fans certainly aren’t ideal for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Shield TV now supports PS5 and Xbox Series X controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WhoE8T74nPt_JS3T9MtgXeQQgMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68694001/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AVgPMp"&gt;Nvidia is updating its Shield Android TV software to include support for the latest next-gen console controllers. If you own a Shield TV or Shield TV Pro device, you can now pair the PS5 DualSense or Xbox Series X controllers to play Android games or PC titles through Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
