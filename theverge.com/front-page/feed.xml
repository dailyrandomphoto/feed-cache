    <title>TCL is bringing two new budget 5G phones to US carriers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DaVVvoLFzwZnegeDZgz5zizsXMI=/0x49:2480x1702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345550/TCL_30_V_5G_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NPQoRa"&gt;TCL will debut a total of eight new phones globally in 2022, but it’s kicking the year off by introducing two models coming exclusively to the US: the TCL 30 XE 5G and TCL 30 V 5G. The 30 XE 5G offers a 6.52-inch 90Hz display and will be sold initially at T-Mobile with other carrier availability later in the year. The 30 V 5G will be exclusive to Verizon, with sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G connectivity. With these new devices, TCL looks to be playing to its strengths in the budget market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfYUKd"&gt;The TCL 30 V 5G boasts a slightly bigger 6.67-inch 1080p display with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It uses a Snapdragon 480 5G chipset with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 30 V includes a 50-megapixel main rear camera and a 5-megapixel ultrawide, alongside 2-megapixel macro and 16-megapixel selfie cameras. It offers a 4,500mAh battery and comes with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPmZW3aeJ9K2i3CK8Bra7xa8O1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130731/TCL_30_V_5G_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive with all flavors of 5G connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L52BGC"&gt;The TCL 30 XE is positioned as an entry-level 5G device with a 720p display, MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of built-in storage. It offers a 13-megapixel rear main camera and an 8-megapixel selfie cam, plus rear depth and macro sensors. The 30 XE also includes a 4,500mAh battery and ships with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8KWHCw7s7t4hTixLDCFXFaUAVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23130743/TCL_30_XE_5G_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30 XE 5G includes a 90Hz display for smoother animations and scrolling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wbO3JT"&gt;The 30-series marks TCL’s third generation of devices bearing the display maker’s own branding — previously, it produced phones for other brands. While last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;upper midrange 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt; didn’t quite hit the mark, we thought its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;sub-$300 devices&lt;/a&gt; were a great bargain with their big, vibrant screens and low price tags. TCL appears to be leaning into the US budget market with its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41NjJh"&gt;TCL says both phones will launch “in the coming weeks.” There’s no pricing announced yet, but it’s a fair bet that the Verizon phone will cost more and require a premium unlimited plan to get the most out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL wants its latest budget tablets to be easy on the eyes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWiMWDIyCHI5GvjscStkVwkCpwU=/93x220:2388x1750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345526/tcl_nxtpaper10s_ces2022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The TCL Nxtpaper 10S tablet reduces blue light by 10 percent. | Image by TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UvjRLV"&gt;TCL introduced a lineup of new tablets at CES this year, which includes its latest iteration of the NxtPaper and budget-friendly Tab series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DmpfP"&gt;The NxtPaper 10S offers a similar “paper-like” display and a focus on combatting eye strain as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219269/tcl-nxtpaper-tablet-color-display-ereader"&gt;eight-inch predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. But this isn’t electronic paper. It’s a 10.1-inch IPS display that TCL says reduces blue light by 50 percent and has an anti-glare finish. Unlike the previously released NxtPaper tablet, the 10S comes with a proprietary T Pen to jot down notes and boasts a bigger 8,000mAh battery. The NxtPaper 10S is set to go on sale for $249 in Europe and China next month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-vMHbpccIlsA4LcpAO75A3bH6A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129117/tcl_tab_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The budget-friendly TCL Tab 8 comes with 4G LTE connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="58H6kD"&gt;TCL’s Tab 8 4G is apparently designed with affordability in mind and appears to be a step down from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22736065/tcl-tab-pro-5g-verizon-mmwave-tablet-device"&gt;the 5G Tab Pro&lt;/a&gt; that the company released in October of last year. It comes with a 4,080mAh battery and, as its name suggests, the option for 4G LTE connectivity. TCL is releasing this tablet alongside another low-cost option, the Tab 10L, which has a 10.1-inch HD screen but doesn’t support mobile connectivity. The Tab 8 4G will cost $129 and will come to European markets sometime in the first quarter of this year, while the Tab 10L will be priced at just $99 and will be available in “select markets” around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJ2d-Ydagzy6kTaj8LViEMXu8k8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129121/tcl_tk_mini.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL TKEE Mini comes with bumpers to help protect it from drops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1wluXC"&gt;Lastly, TCL’s TKEE series of tablets are built specifically for children and have displays that TCL claims will protect kids’ eyes. There are three tiers: the TKEE Mini, Mid, and Max, with the Mid model being the only one of the bunch that supports 4G connectivity. Each tablet sports a rugged design with bumpers that are supposed to protect it from drops, along with a TKEE Pen that kids can use to draw or write on the tablet. Although the TKEE series was &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/tcl-launches-alcatel-tkee-tablets-for-kids-in-india"&gt;previously launched in India&lt;/a&gt; last year, it’s slated for release “in select regions” at the beginning of this year, starting at $89 for the Mini, $149 for the Mid, and $119 for the Max. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Version two of TCL’s wearable display glasses are lighter and less dorky-looking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFNxfk_TpazNRLm7mVLJt51Nf4U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345514/__13.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NxtWear Air is a personal secondary display for your phone or laptop embedded in a pair of glasses frames.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEnFQD"&gt;TCL is preparing to launch a second iteration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;wearable personal display&lt;/a&gt; it released in limited supply last year. Version two, called NxtWear Air, offers the same secondary-display-in-a-pair-of-glasses function as the original but has been made 30 percent lighter — down to 75g compared to 130g. TCL has made some adjustments for the style-conscious, too, tweaking the design to look more like a normal pair of sunglasses and less like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545583/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-glasses-availability-price"&gt;something you’d be embarrassed to wear in public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbDqj"&gt;NxtWear Air, like its NxtWear G predecessor, offers two 1080p Micro OLEDs embedded in a pair of glasses frames that should give the wearer the effect of viewing a 140-inch screen from about 13 feet away. Its lenses are opaque, and the glasses don’t offer AR or VR functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-HaUch8sOBSMyPS9eV8Qz6Rjeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131389/___11.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swappable plates attach to the front of the frames via magnets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tkE34P"&gt;Instead, it acts as a secondary display that you wear on your face, using USB-C to connect to a DisplayPort-compatible phone, tablet, or laptop. Stereo speakers are built in, but if you don’t want to annoy everyone in earshot, you should connect Bluetooth or wired headphones instead. This year’s model also comes with two magnetic interchangeable plates that attach to the front of the frames to change up the style of the glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoBjI2"&gt;TCL says NxtWear Air will launch in Q1 of 2022. There’s no word on which regions it will be available in, and TCL hasn’t revealed a price for them yet. NxtWear G went on sale in a limited run in Australia last year priced at $899 (about $680 US), so expect to spend a little money for the most private monitor you can use on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL’s latest portable speakers bring the light show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwUYXL-EHmbleotilHcKBniP-qQ=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345521/jbl_light_show.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CfRx5J"&gt;Today JBL is taking the wraps off three new portable speakers. The diminutive Pulse 5 and more powerful PartyBox Encore feature integrated light shows, while the BoomBox 3 tries to split the difference with a more stoic, bass-focused design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0ssKg"&gt;The waterproof and dustproof (IP67) JBL Pulse 5 ($249.95/£219.99/€249) is a portable Bluetooth 5.3 speaker that fires 360-degree sound and lighting for up to 12 hours on rechargeable battery. The lights can be customized via the JBL Portable app and work without playing any sound at all. The speaker can also be combined with other JBL PartyBoost-enabled speakers for bigger sound and more dynamic lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CokHGAiKwCEz_ytA9u4frkVBYDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131831/JBL_Partybox_Encore_Lifestyle_with_mic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JBL PartyBox Encore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iQPWgJ"&gt;JBL bills the 100 watt PartyBox Encore ($399.95/£299.99/€349) as a “compact party speaker” that includes a digital wireless mic for singalongs. It flashes along with the beat from Bluetooth 5.1 audio streams for up to 10 hours on battery. Audio can also be sourced over USB and Aux-in jacks, and an interface on top gives direct control over the lightshow, mic, and volume. Integrated handles still allow for portability, but its IPX4-rated resistance to splashes makes it less rugged than the Pulse 5.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikI9NbD2aHNGT4IMXqcPz4mMgcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131830/JBL_BOOMBOX3_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JBL BoomBox 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="23I2f4"&gt;JBL is also announcing a new Boombox 3 ($499.95/£449.99/€549) speaker update. It doesn’t include any lighting, but it does come packing a subwoofer, two mid-range drivers, and two tweeters that should provide chest-thumping sound for up to 24 hours before needing a recharge. JBL says the Boombox 3 can deliver deeper bass than its Boombox predecessors alongside “intense clarity.” Other specs include an IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, Bluetooth 5.3 streaming, and a built-in power bank feature that can charge your phone. It’ll ship in both black and “squad” (read: camouflage) colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odD50S"&gt;JBL says that all three speakers should be available to buy sometime this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Schlage announces first Apple Home Key-compatible smart lock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i66y4veI_-UCewosbPTB3Dnares=/0x72:4171x2853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345536/Schlage_Encode_Plus_with_home_keys_phone_TaptoUnlock__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus is the first Apple home key smart lock.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Schlage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BogEBd"&gt;At CES 2022 this week, lock manufacturer Schlage announced it is launching the first lock in North America to support Apple’s Home Key. The Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt is an updated version of the popular Schlage Encode WiFi smart lock, adding an NFC chip for the Home Key function, as well as a Thread radio to support HomeKit over Thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3m5d9"&gt;Home Key, introduced with iOS 15, lets you store a digital door key in your Apple Wallet and lock and unlock your door by tapping your device on the lock, similar to how Apple Pay or Apple Transit works. The system uses the iPhone’s or Apple Watch’s NFC chip to authenticate a user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F0yh0"&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus will be available in spring 2022 for $300 (that Plus moniker comes with a $50 price hike from the original Encode). The Schlage Sense, a HomeKit-only lock that doesn’t support Home Key, is still available for $200.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1I2plVQ0OjwEWwwI_fu_WcNcHSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134609/Encode_Plus_CEN_Satin_Nickel_Front_Door__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schlage Encode Plus works with HomeKit, Alexa, and Google and doesn’t require a hub or bridge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pCb1Oo"&gt;The addition of Home Key gives the Encode a feature available on other door locks that so far it had been largely lacking — a hands-free way to unlock the door (if you use the watch option, that is). You can also control it with an app, a keypad, a regular key, and voice control using Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b76WbY"&gt;Home Key has two modes for unlocking: “Express Mode,” where you don’t have to unlock your phone, and “Require Face ID or Passcode,” which adds the step of authenticating with Face ID or Touch ID. If you lose your phone, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210515#markaslost"&gt;enabling Lost Mode through Apple’s Find My feature&lt;/a&gt; will disable all elements of your Apple Wallet, including Home Key. If your phone battery is dying, you can still unlock the door with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20991458/apple-pay-express-transit-london-tfl-feature-available"&gt;Power Reserve feature introduced in iOS14&lt;/a&gt;. It works in the same way it does with Express Transit mode, functioning for up to five hours after the red Power Reserve icon appears on an Apple Watch or iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RuHQv"&gt;Home Key also brings with it the option to manage access keys in HomeKit, so you can have different codes for different folks. A nice feature for families is that once you set up Home Key on your device, every member of the household who is part of your Apple Home automatically has the key added to their wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6aj6bmUukeqwtTnT3gXqoPN_MsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134807/Schlage_Encode_Plus_with_Apple_home_keys_Watch_TaptoUnlock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When paired with home key, the Schlage lock can be controlled using just your Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dNDpcy"&gt;The Schlage Encode retains the same exterior design and all the existing features of the non-Plus version and integrates with Google and Amazon Alexa smart home platforms for automations and voice control via the Schlage Home app. You can use HomeKit and the Schlage app simultaneously. As a Wi-Fi lock, it doesn’t require any separate hub or bridge for remote access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fk6Hn"&gt;However, the lock can be set up entirely in HomeKit if you prefer, although it requires an Apple Home hub (such as a HomePod Mini or Apple TV) for remote access in this configuration. The Schlage app also adds a few features not in HomeKit, such as scheduling access and a built-in alarm feature. “With this lock, we’re giving our customers the opportunity to use all the different features and integrations — Alexa, Google Assistant, as well as HomeKit,” says Donald Beene, senior product manager for Allegion (parent company of Schlage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z2iwcl"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt|105415" data-volume-uuid="35fe5e45e" data-volume-id="105415" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-483" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;This video produced by Schlage shows the Encode Plus in action.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhsnYi"&gt;The lock is available in the same styles and finishes as the Encode: the more traditional Camelot design or the more modern Century option. The only physical difference is the addition of two NFC targets on the keypad screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj7dIS"&gt;The Encode Plus uses four protocols, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and Thread. NFC has been part of Schlage’s commercial options previously, but this is the first time it’s used it in residential locks. There are a few other locks that currently support NFC; one is the Level Lock Touch, but Schlage is the first to come to market in North America with a Home Key-compatible lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4FbFw"&gt;The Thread radio supports HomeKit over Thread specifically, says Beene, and is Schlage’s first Thread-enabled product. The company is closely watching the developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, too. “The hardware is here for Matter,” he says. “This will be the first [lock] product with the hardware on board to support something like that, but we still don’t know where those tech specs will land.” Matter is slated to launch in mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schlage Encode Plus comes in two styles: the contemporary Century (above) and traditional Camelot (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn75H4o2myz_VbPgYBxZeWYo7fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142274/Schlage_Encode_Plus_Camelot_in_Aged_Bronze_Exterior_x_Interior__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schlage&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Camelot and the Century will come in matte black, satin nickel, and aged bronze (pictured) finishes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="atWqYu"&gt;With all those radios on board, battery life could be an issue. With all-in use — i.e., if you connect the lock over Wi-Fi to the Schlage app and to HomeKit — the battery life is about four to five months, says Beene. Using HomeKit only, it jumps up to about a year, he says, but you will need an Apple Home Hub for remote access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3UWT9"&gt;The addition of Home Key and HomeKit compatibility makes the Encode Plus one of the most fully featured smart locks on the market (for iPhone owners, although Beene told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is looking at bringing the NFC function to Android phones). August and Yale’s August-powered smart locks also have wide compatibility with smart home platforms and an auto-unlock feature that uses geofencing to control your lock as you approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHL6rO"&gt;My experience with August locks is that the auto-unlock feature is quite hit or miss. Home Key looks to be a more reliable way to easily unlock your door in a hands-free fashion. Currently, a fingerprint reader is my favorite way to unlock a smart door lock, but we’ll have to wait and see whether this will prove to be a more convenient option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCgEGO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vanv7k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlrZ6n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cync is trying to build an affordable smart home ecosystem, and it might work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2IF25vGAh0hHSyDzr5NgpwS0T4E=/510x0:1470x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345535/CYNC_Release_Header_v3.png.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cync’s line of smart home products now includes new bulb options, an outdoor camera, and a smart thermostat.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GE Lighting&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8hB7t"&gt;Cync, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22214846/c-by-ge-cync-rebrand-savant-systems-smart-camera"&gt;the brand born from C by GE&lt;/a&gt;, showed off a huge expansion of its smart lighting line at CES 2022 (yes, in person). Eleven new smart bulbs join its already comprehensive offerings. Plus, the company is expanding further into the smart home with a new outdoor camera and the release of its first smart thermostat, complete with room sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSLTe9"&gt;Cync also shared its commitment to the new Matter smart home standard, telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its color A19 bulb and light strip will be Matter-compatible via a firmware update when the standard launches in mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56Gbu7"&gt;Cync’s products — which include light switches, indoor and outdoor bulbs, smart plugs, an indoor camera, and a motion sensor — use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Mesh for connectivity. They don’t require a hub and are compatible with Google and Alexa smart home platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqXyNd"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-sell-lighting-business-savant-systems-inc"&gt;its acquisition by Savant Systems in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Cync has had aspirations of becoming a complete smart home solution, offering one app for users to control their smart home. Hence more security cameras (it released an indoor camera at last CES and this year has two outdoor versions) and a smart thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVoNzJ"&gt;“We want the Cync app to become a bigger part of the smart home and be a single place for a consumer to interact with their home,” Paul Williams, vice president of Experiences GE Lighting, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z-wKD6GsOOIEbihon4U04mSQkv0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23135435/Garage_TrueImage.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GE Lighting&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cync app has some innovative features, including TrueImage — which shows you what your home looks like when you adjust the lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OVqPGz"&gt;Currently, it’s hardly a complete smart home, but if Matter allows it to bring third parties into its app, those aspirations become more achievable. “For us, Matter is an easier way to bring other products into our ecosystem, something that really comes into play with the Cync app,” says Williams. It won’t be a free for all; however, Cync would curate the devices that worked in its app to “make sure it’s a quality experience for the consumer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7FV1g"&gt;Cync sits in the mid-range of the smart home in terms of pricing, cheaper than Hue, Eve, and Google Nest for the most part, but more expensive than some of the budget options out there. Its backing by Savant, a high-end, professionally installed smart home system,  does give it some impressive credentials. But to date, we’ve yet to see that really manifest itself in usable integrations between its products, although Williams says those are coming soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVBYsf"&gt;Here’s a look at the specs, pricing, and release dates of the products Cync announced this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C217xkM-Bftugk4tMjQ7QwrTfyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23135383/Decorative_Bulbs_White_Exterior.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GE Lighting&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decorative bulbs such as candelabras and Globes are now part of GE Lighting’s Cync line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zQ4xZK"&gt;Cync smart bulbs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W1tNiL"&gt;Cync is adding six decorative smart bulbs that fit in fixtures such as chandeliers and vanity lighting. The line starts at $11.99 and includes a soft white candelabra and soft white and color ST19 bulbs, plus soft white and color Globes (G25). The new Cync smart bulbs will be available to order in March from Lowe’s, Best Buy, Target, and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqmnJx"&gt;Recessed smart lighting is also a new addition, featuring 4-inch and 6-inch color LED downlights, starting at $35 and offering 760 lumens at 2700 Kelvins. Plus, there are also three new, general-purpose bulbs part of a new line called Reveal, which offers better clarity and contrast.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsmcSNOC3w0_BuTrQFyMtCkwV18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23135366/Outdoor_Camera_Battery_Front.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GE Lighting&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cync Outdoor Camera is battery-powered or hardwired and offers local storage. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NS2c6p"&gt;Cync Outdoor Camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iIMp74"&gt;Following up on its indoor camera, Cync’s new outdoor camera comes in both wired and battery / solar-powered options. It features 2K/1280P HD video, night vision, and a swivel head to manually angle the camera to cover an optimal area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kf7EqZ"&gt;Video can be stored locally on an SD card or in the Cync cloud using CamSync ($3 per month, per camera). The camera launches in February at Lowe’s, Best Buy, and Amazon. The wired version will cost $100, the battery option $130, and the solar panel add-on accessory $45. There will also be extra batteries available for $30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wr8LJpAaGMOVHjfBIofo9Om-0rk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23135356/Thermostat.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GE Lighting&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cync’s new smart thermostat works with remote room sensors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8o7HCj"&gt;Cync Smart Thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="v0x20S"&gt;The Cync Smart Thermostat is a Wi-Fi-controlled thermostat with a large touchscreen display for on-device control, as well as the option to program and control it from the Cync app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqo4vs"&gt;An included power extension kit can be used if a user doesn’t have a C-Wire installed, and the thermostat can be used alone or with the new Cync Room Temperature Sensors. The sensors can monitor individual rooms or average the temperature across the entire home. They are temperature-only, no motion or humidity sensors, although the thermostat itself has a humidity sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0QdGj"&gt;The thermostat costs $120 and the sensors $30 each. They will be available starting in January from Lowe’s, Best Buy, and Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL jumps from cheap TVs to cheap laptops with the $349 Book 14 Go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptRYjpJ3zLSdOpaLUJhYowGp2wM=/37x0:2310x1515/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345499/Book14_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s new laptop, the TCL Book 14 Go.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tSIv5n"&gt;TCL, which is perhaps best known for its lower-cost TVs, smartphones, and tablets, is expanding into laptops with the TCL Book 14 Go. The company is also targeting an affordable cost with this new laptop, pricing it at $349&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— though that budget price means it doesn’t have the most impressive specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uigwN"&gt;The new Windows 11 laptop has a 14.1-inch display with a 1366 x 768 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio, and TCL is promising its 40Wh battery will last for 10 to 12 hours. It’s an ARM-based laptop with a Snapdragon 7c CPU, and it also has an Adreno 618 GPU. And the laptop can connect to LTE networks, so you can get on the internet while away from a Wi-Fi connection. It only has 128GB of onboard storage, though you can expand that with an SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdJsqz"&gt;One thing we don’t know yet is when it will be released in the US, but if you need a budget laptop right now, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652565/best-cheap-laptops"&gt;our recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on what to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This week in audio: podcast ads gone wrong and the news you missed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j17CdgDmW2ZqoSLMlU-H5Ng8d5A=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345577/acastro_210430_1777_audioApps_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X13fUX"&gt;Hello and welcome to 2022. It remains winter, y’all. I haven’t seen the sun in seemingly weeks, but we’re pushing through, surviving on podcast news for warmth and cheeriness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avjrUM"&gt;Now, let’s get to the news. There’s not a ton to discuss today, but I do have a new report that I’m excited to share with you all. Let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAGnMH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Podcast ads gone wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGgvps"&gt;This morning, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22629075"&gt;published a story on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the ongoing push to make programmatic advertising work in podcasting and the struggles podcasters are already experiencing. The idea behind the transition is to allow advertisers to easily and automatically bid on podcast ad inventory and have those ads targeted against specific audiences. This is why we’ve seen podcast platforms not only buy up advertising and hosting platforms, like Amazon with Art19 and Spotify with Megaphone, but also ink deals with podcasters for the exclusive rights to sell ads against their programming. To make this work, platforms not only need a lot of advertisers but also a lot of podcast inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAION0"&gt;That’s only one part of the challenge, however. The second, and likely the more difficult one, is getting podcasters comfortable with the idea that software will insert ads into their shows without their expressed okay for each individual ad. This is especially tricky in podcasting because it has traditionally been an industry where the audience appreciates the ads they hear and takes action because of them. (I’m sure some folks would even argue this is the “magic” of podcasting and a critical selling point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0PpcFb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MAOR7X"&gt;All this context leads us to my story, which highlights a few situations in which ads showed up in places they shouldn’t have. A science podcast, for example, received ads for oil companies, despite blocking those categories. Meanwhile, American Public Media entirely disabled programmatic from its children’s programming after an incident in which an ad for &lt;em&gt;The Sex Lives of College Girls &lt;/em&gt;was inserted. Both of these issues come down to miscategorization, or ads being categorized under one catchall genre that either is inaccurate or not robust enough. In the case of&lt;em&gt; Sex Lives of College Girls&lt;/em&gt;, for example, the ad was categorized under “television” but could have come with some sort of rating or mature label to prevent this exact situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeO2C6"&gt;In both incidents, Spotify powered the ads. I reached out for clarification on how the platform classifies ads, as well as what it’s doing to prevent situations like these moving forward and have yet to hear back. Still, Spotify has been the most vocal about its moves into podcast advertising and presumably needs programmatic to work in order to make money back on all its audio investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZXKJx"&gt;I have questions, though, following this reporting. For one, does the industry &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to move toward a programmatic future? Is getting away from personalized host-read ads the best move? Can podcast ads become automated while maintaining a high-quality bar? Will audiences soon learn to tune out podcast ads, like they do with TV ads, radio ads, and web ads? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obvJaC"&gt;I don’t have the answers, though I do have my thoughts, most of which is yes, the industry, with industry being defined as big companies, wants this, so long as it isn’t a requirement for smaller shows to participate, but that it will come with a sacrifice of audience engagement. I think we’ll also end up in a world with no skip button. Some intrepid platform might make its selling point the ability to skip ads, though, and while I’m thinking far down the line, these decisions are what the industry is building toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Da9bM"&gt;Phew, that was a long one. I just have a few more bullet point news notes to mention, mostly stuff we couldn’t shout out before the holiday. Starting with some ad-centric news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeWVX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SiriusXM signs content development and ad sales deal with Tom Segura’s YMH Studios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXVujb"&gt;SiriusXM keeps on making deals. This time, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-signs-exclusive-deal-with-tom-segura-and-christina-ps-ymh-studios-creators-of-your-moms-house-podcast-301448225.html"&gt;signed one&lt;/a&gt; with comedians Tom Segura and Christina P for their YMH Studios. The two companies will work on developing new content, the content will go ad-free within Stitcher Premium, and Sirius retains exclusive global ad sales rights. This follows Sirius’ deals with &lt;em&gt;The Last Podcast on the Left&lt;/em&gt;, Audiochuck, and 99% Invisible, among others. It’s all about the ad sales, baby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUZBua"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; profiles ICM’s Caroline Edwards, focusing on “activism and advocacy” content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLsnUO"&gt;Before Christmas, heh sorry for the delay, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/12/icm-diverse-voices-kids-podcasting-business-caroline-edwards-1234892494/"&gt;profiled&lt;/a&gt; ICM’s director of podcast initiatives Caroline Edwards. The piece mostly involves Edwards taking stock of the industry up until now and offering us some idea of what she and the team are focusing on in 2022. They’re looking at “diverse voices,” children’s programming, and politics — specifically advocacy and activism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="heevGf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPSB7h"&gt;“I’m really excited about bringing up, cultivating, and supporting this next generation of people talking about what’s going on in our world and what we can do about it. They’re not the easiest sales, but 2020 was all about the celebrity show, and the fallout from that is not all of them are hits, so we need to focus on people who are native to this medium. People are now looking at people who are just genuinely good [at podcasting],” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgaWQc"&gt;Here we are with ad sales again :’)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMsVOP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify’s chief legal officer and head of global affairs leaves for Disney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynh008"&gt;A small note here but Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify’s chief legal office and head of global affairs, is &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/12/disney-spotify-horacio-gutierrez-general-counsel-alan-braverman-1234900761/"&gt;leaving for Disney&lt;/a&gt;, where he’ll be senior executive VP, general counsel, and secretary. Many words, one title. He’ll take over that role on February 1st. Gutierrez mostly showed up in our world as the primary spokesperson for Spotify’s battle against Apple. My editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;interviewed him for &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in June, during which Gutierrez argued Apple not only acts as a monopoly but is “unfair” and deserving of government regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="w8Buci"&gt;
&lt;p id="DsAFkE"&gt;That’s all, folks. I hope the podcast news gods will bless us with more this week because we’ll be back Thursday and Friday for you Insider subscribers. For the free folks, we’ll see you again Tuesday. Bye-bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvL36y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8LeIfq"&gt;Skydio, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded"&gt;the US company building self-flying, obstacle-dodging drones&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;a three-year-old can pilot without fear&lt;/a&gt;, is making two announcements today during CES 2022. One of them is an expensive fix for the Skydio 2’s single biggest shortcoming — the other, a totally free update that adds one of the most exciting features yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnOiPt"&gt;First, the Skydio 2 Plus. At $1,099 and up, the new drone promises the kind of long-range, robust connection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892377/skydio-2-drone-autonomous-self-flying-camera-controller-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;that the original Skydio 2 was missing&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a new high-power 5GHz Wi-Fi radio and a pair of pop-up antennas. The company now claims you’ll see 3 kilometers of range from a new optional Skydio 2 Plus Beacon controller — twice as much as with the original Skydio 2 and Beacon — and 6 kilometers of range if you’re using the optional twin-stick Skydio Controller, up from 3.5km originally. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rjw-X1zNzEnIltV4ZzW8AVuOP2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143334/vpavic_220103_4953_0058.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only way to tell the Skydio 2 and Skydio 2 Plus apart is the pop-up antennas. The Beacon looks identical, too. The twin-stick Controller hasn’t changed at all either, sadly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jYtu5x"&gt;It’s also got nearly 20 percent more battery, thanks to a higher-density pack with a slightly stronger magnet. Skydio says its maximum flight time is 27 minutes, up from 24 previously, and you can use the new battery packs on the old Skydio 2 if you want. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FoNMXYxDnNdDZtabN7frnoWQGC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143331/vpavic_220103_4953_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new battery pack has a 59.9Wh capacity, up from 48.8Wh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sVZAeT"&gt;As far as hardware updates go, radios and batteries are it — the Skydio 2 Plus has the same airframe, the same cameras, and the same computing inside as the original Skydio 2, and Skydio CEO Adam Bry tells us it will replace the Skydio 2 entirely from here on out. Good news for new buyers, not quite as nice for existing owners, yeah? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lddCph"&gt;Skydio KeyFrame&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="dP4yLZ"&gt;But both Skydio 2 and Skydio 2 Plus owners will soon have a brand-new feature in common, one that won’t cost an additional cent: a new mode called KeyFrame, which unlocks one of the most impressive concepts for drone cinematography I’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYNoyjccaEE"&gt;since Skydio first made follow-me drone footage a reality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZvzpF"&gt;If you’re a video editor, you don’t need me to tell you how keyframes work — you’ve likely already worked out what Skydio intends to do from the name alone. But for those who are unfamiliar, “keyframes” are the key moments in any animation or movement that define how that motion will look when you play it back&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; what it looks like at the beginning, at the end, and at various points in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BfbnND0PjcK9jhut0sTEjd86oG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143960/Skydio_Keyframe_Graphic_Rendering_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Skydio&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skydio’s rendering of how KeyFrame works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f307ev"&gt;But with Skydio’s self-flying drone, you don’t need to sketch or photograph those still frames, of course. You simply fly there. You fly the drone to a point in 3D space, press a button when the drone’s camera is lined up with what you want to see in the video, then fly to the next, virtually storyboarding your shot with every press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umifko"&gt;Then you pick how fast you want the drone to fly, hit play, and — I’m not exaggerating here — the drone does all the rest. It automatically plots a route to fly between your keyframes all by itself, hitting each one in turn, while using Skydio’s six-camera obstacle avoidance system to dodge any obstacles on the way. It automatically performs smooth camera motions in the air, filming the whole time at your resolution and frame rate of choice. When Skydio’s CEO first showed it to me, the phrase that flashed to my mind was “realtor mode” — you could theoretically use this to easily showcase beautiful swooping views of a property, without any experience as a cinematographer or drone pilot. Here’s Skydio’s own example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVNsY3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOTGikGwrUs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t8G3Ga"&gt;As I soon found out when testing, the reality isn’t quite as simple as I imagined — it’s still a skill to learn, and while you may not have to worry about the Skydio crashing &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; obstacles, they can definitely still mess up your shots, forcing the drone to dodge in ways you can’t anticipate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWqZlw"&gt;I spent my first set of batteries trying to get a beautiful one-shot overview of my own home, but I had to scrap almost every attempt because the drone dodged a branch awkwardly here or strayed into my neighbor’s yard over there, even if it didn’t do it the take before. (Bry tells me there are currently no plans to bring geofencing to the company’s consumer drones quite yet.) I don’t have a mansion with sprawling open grounds to film, I’m afraid — I’ve got a normal home with overhanging trees and a fence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mMRA3P"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nstA7iRuW6g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E28p2Q"&gt;When I took KeyFrame to a park with freshly recharged batteries, I had a better time — at least after I realized I needed to chase after the drone a bit to keep it within the original Skydio 2’s Wi-Fi range. I got a really cool shot of an empty playground that’d be a lot of fun for my kids. But it still took six takes to figure out a speed slow enough that the drone would get steady footage, yet fast enough it wouldn’t be a bore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0bxfW"&gt;It also seems the only way to change the flight path is to add a new keyframe or subtract an existing one and let it calculate its route again — and adding a new keyframe changes the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; flight path, not just a small portion. It’s a lot of trial and error, and it’s particularly annoying that the Skydio app doesn’t save your keyframes when you swap batteries. For now, you have to start over every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pbHtO6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10960449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkSMCM"&gt;I don’t mean to damn KeyFrame with faint praise, though. When I finished draining that second set of batteries, I didn’t want to stop; I wanted to learn the skill. Today’s drone cinematographers are incredible multitaskers, ones who typically have to fly a drone and aim its camera simultaneously, all while intuiting how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to crash into obstacles they can’t necessarily see — they need to meticulously plan their routes and/or wind up with a pile of scrap afterwards. I don’t have either of those luxuries, but an autonomous skill like KeyFrame means I don’t necessarily need to. As long as you’re happy with Skydio’s piloting, you don’t necessarily have to worry about the flying part at all — just the part where you’re getting the shot you want and need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbW8AR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464280/skydio-2-x2-3d-scan-photogrammetry"&gt;Like with the Skydio 3D Scan software I tried last summer&lt;/a&gt;, or its autonomy engine in general, it continues to be amazing that a drone can fly and film things all by itself. Limitations abound, but we’re within spitting distance of something that used to feature in barely plausible science fiction movies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WyFqoqbLayUf2YkyctAyMB92Ifw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554185/skydio_scan_test_448.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Skydio software &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464280/skydio-2-x2-3d-scan-photogrammetry" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;can do this, too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="5flveP"&gt;Other Skydio updates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="BnyOuA"&gt;Bry tells me Skydio has grown during the pandemic. The company has 400 people now, and it’s still tweaking its basic autonomy algorithms that underpin both the Skydio 2 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"&gt;its Skydio X2 military and enterprise drone&lt;/a&gt; to detect new things like water and sky. The drone sees water as a “less trustworthy” reference point for visual navigation, and uses the lack of sky to know that it’s flying indoors and should adjust its speed and distance appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx3ePW"&gt;The other thing Skydio is announcing today is a new insurance program for its drones called Skydio Care, which may come as a bit of a surprise for people who bought into the idea of a drone that doesn’t crash — but as we discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;during our review&lt;/a&gt;, Skydio had already specified a bunch of circumstances under which its “repair or replace for free” warranty wouldn’t apply, including flying around thin branches, netting, chain link fence, windows, mirrors, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303316/skydio-2-self-flying-drone-update-on-sale-covid"&gt;trying to land directly above an obstacle&lt;/a&gt; (where Skydio still weirdly turns off its obstacle avoidance systems and will happily land on the edge of a roof or table before plummeting to its doom if you’re careless enough to let it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgyQUH"&gt;Now, the standard 12-month warranty will only cover hardware failures and malfunctions, while a new $149 Skydio Care plan will let you swap your broken drone “no matter the reason” for a flat fee of $150 with no questions asked. “This isn’t intended to cover people taking their drone into their backyard and setting fire to it,” Bry clarifies when I ask. A second drone replacement costs $200, and you pay $550 if you lose your drone entirely. There’s also a $249 Skydio Care plan that extends those coverages to two years instead of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="184LMi"&gt;Bry still isn’t talking about future hardware possibilities, like whether Skydio will build mini drones or foldable drones like his competitors at DJI, or even whether it’ll replace the rebranded Parrot controller that it sells for the Skydio 2 with something more comfortable and robust. He tells me there’s no ability to pair a Skydio 2 or 2 Plus with the nicer controller that ships with the Skydio X2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce8BrQ"&gt;At least, he says, “not one that we can announce today.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This TP-Link router automatically moves its antenna for the best Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AiAr1cZnHJupR_lrU53bZgp8vsA=/62x0:532x313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345439/Screenshot_2021_12_29_155732.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;What we all thought routers would look like&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wZAX3P"&gt;In what is likely one of the stranger innovations at CES this year, TP-Link is showing off the prototype for its new Archer AXE200 Omni router. There are plenty of new routers taking advantage of 6E connectivity debuting at this year's CES, but the engineering of this particular router is sure to raise some eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yoUykVGgokUJmcBt0yMTMY1hsHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132988/Screenshot_2021_12_29_155732.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vhi9jL"&gt;The AXE200 features four antennas that automatically fold out and rotate to seek out the best possible signal, wherever it happens to be. While the necessity of this particular feature is debatable, it's pretty wild to see a router come to life and instinctively articulate its arms like some kind of alien homing beacon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9eWUsZlwCbWKrqFoloVaXjB_zHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132976/Screenshot_2021_12_29_161608.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0iI4pQ"&gt;While the effectiveness of this particular feature isn’t certain, the technical specs are definitely impressive. As you might expect from a 6E router, the AXE200 features improved tri-band speed, with a 6Ghz band joining the existing 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz bands. Additionally, the Wi-Fi 6E compatibility allows the router to exploit additional bandwidth and reduce latency overall. The AXE200 is still in the prototype stages, so there isn’t any information regarding the price point or a release window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cE5N7O"&gt;For anyone in the market for something a little more conventional, TP-Link is also premiering its Archer AXE300 quad-band router, which doesn’t feature autonomous antennas but shares the same extraterrestrial design. The AXE300 takes full advantage of WiFi 6E with duplicate 5GHz bands in addition to the 6Ghz and 2.4Ghz bands. The price for this particular unit is to be determined but is scheduled to become available in Q2 of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
