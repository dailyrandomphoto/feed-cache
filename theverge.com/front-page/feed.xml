    <title>OnePlus 9s get new look and features in OxygenOS 12 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZspA1"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;OnePlus is a sub-brand of the Oppo family&lt;/a&gt;, the two companies not only merged their R&amp;amp;D departments in early 2021, but they are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;consolidating code for their two Android-based operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. While OxygenOS 12 will be used on global OnePlus phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;ColorOS 12 will only be on China-only&lt;/a&gt; Oppo and OnePlus phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2pODX"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;Android 12 to AOSP today&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus is releasing the first open beta of OxygenOS 12 to the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro now, while those with older models will have to wait for a later update. Once this version is deemed stable, it is likely a full version will be released within a month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;according to XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p4SNh5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="479hSr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3mUnD"&gt;The new and improved OxygenOS 12 is colorful and minimalist like “&lt;a href="https://jamesturrell.com/"&gt;James Turrell’s&lt;/a&gt; Light and Space artwork,” as explained &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-12-open-beta-1-for-oneplus-9-series.1502946/"&gt;in its forum post&lt;/a&gt; announcing this release. OxygenOS 12 shares some of the same design languages as ColorOS 12 and Android 12 by extension. All three OSes make liberal use of white space, as well as large sans-serif typography to “enhance readability and ease of use.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoGgdw"&gt;OxygenOS 12 also follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Material You aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, where the new icons use simple lines, and new widgets use shapes to make information and actions more clear and accessible to a diverse group of users. Just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679087/oppo-oneplus-coloros-12-update-announced-release-date"&gt;ColorOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus software is enhanced with more shadows and subtle gradients to give OxygenOS 12 a more premium look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QM3BN5-sJCAvznQ-UQDo0IcSwac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900111/darkmodes_3up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OxygenOS 12 offers three levels of Dark Mode to give you more control over your phone’s UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="orGxgt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hviAhT"&gt;In addition to its new look, OxgyenOS 12 also learned some new tricks to improve your experience with OnePlus phones. If you’ve been playing with the developer preview of Android 12 on the OnePlus 9 series, you’ll be happy to know these features have made it into the open beta of OxygenOS 12:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t5RKxn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Private Safe&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature isolates sensitive files to a secured part of your phone, where you can safely store and protect specific photos, videos, audios, and documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yprYw6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Updated OnePlus Shelf &amp;amp; OnePlus Scout&lt;/strong&gt;: The handy Shelf has been enhanced with even more widgets: from notes, step counting, weather, to the calculator, according to &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-dp-2-oneplus-9-pro-oxygenos/"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;. You can even search for anything on your phone using OnePlus Scout, which is now part of the Shelf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WDehnM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Zen Mode &amp;amp; World Life Balance 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt; First popularized by OnePlus’ Indian users, both modes help you manage work-life balance by separating your personal and work accounts. You can set up different profiles with different Wi-Fi networks, with different app notifications and messages depending on the time of day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1EPmDl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dark Mode:&lt;/strong&gt; This lets you choose between three levels of dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t6WlFY"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note app: &lt;/strong&gt;This updated app now lets you doodle as well as type out your thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9dG93J"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Canvas AOD 2.0: &lt;/strong&gt;The app lets that you create a wireframe image on your lockscreen, based on your wallpaper, is back with more functionality. It now includes more brushes and lines for you to use, as well as more photos and effects available to support your artistic vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="dY7zR8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10789206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nDAAI"&gt;It’s possible that this is the end of the road for OxygenOS, as the two companies could more fully integrate their software into one, rather than maintain two OSes. If that’s the case, OnePlus will hopefully be able to bring some of its most popular features like the Canvas AOD 2.0 and Work Life Balance 2.0 mode to future ColorOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxTi9w"&gt;If you have a OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro and want to try out this open beta of OxygenOS 12, then head to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fsupport%2Fsoftwareupgrade&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F4%2F22704578%2Foneplus-9-pro-oxygen-os-12-color-os-android-12-skin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus’ Updates and Downloads page&lt;/a&gt; to download it onto your computer, and follow the instructions to install the software onto your OnePlus phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exposure to extreme heat grew drastically in the world’s cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Severe Heatwave In Delhi NCR" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u0Usiyk3tccsRKUZgpSIkI2QkPQ=/102x0:4968x3244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949670/1233737617.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;People resting in a lawn on a hot summer day, at Rajpath near Vijay Chowk, on June 30, 2021 in New Delhi, India. As the monsoon continued to play truant, heatwave in Delhi NCR turned severe recording the highest maximum temperature of the season at 43.5 degree Celsius. | Photo by Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nA3D2X"&gt;Exposure to dangerous levels of heat and humidity in cities across the world has exploded over the past three decades, according to new &lt;a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/?p=93867&amp;amp;shareadraft=baba93867_614344bb0ac19"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. In a study of more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;13,000 cities, the number of people exposed to extremely hot and humid days in a given year (measured in “person-days”) tripled between 1983 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hsMLyg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extreme heat is already a leading weather-related killer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BqERQv"&gt;It’s a symptom of two trends colliding: urban population growth and rising global average temperatures. Cities often reach higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas because they’re typically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;designed in a way that traps heat&lt;/a&gt;. So when people flock to urban centers, they’re also flocking to places where they could be at greater risk of heat-related illness and death. To make matters worse,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;extreme heat is already a &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;leading&lt;/a&gt; weather-related killer, and climate change is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;exacerbating the problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kquF1K"&gt;Cities will have to find ways to stay cool in a warming world in order to better protect their residents, the authors argue. “In some cities, long-term adaptation is frankly bleak. But for much of the planet, we can use tools we already have,” says Cascade Tuholske, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and lead author of the study published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. &lt;/em&gt;“Population growth and urbanization to me is not the problem. It’s a lack of planning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sqO0r"&gt;Roughly a quarter of the world’s population lives in places&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;where exposure to extreme heat and humidity is growing, Tuholske and his colleagues found. For the study, they defined “extreme” as at least&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;30 degrees centigrade on the wet-bulb globe temperature scale. The &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/car/WBGT"&gt;wet-bulb globe scale&lt;/a&gt; is a detailed assessment of heat, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and the angle of the sun. Thirty degrees on that scale is comparable to a day that feels like 106 degrees Fahrenheit. (This isn’t a direct conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit because factors outside of temperature are taken into consideration.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHxIMl"&gt;They relied on both infrared satellite imagery and on-the-ground readings to determine weather conditions over roughly the last three decades. Using population data gathered by the European Commission and Columbia’s &lt;a href="http://www.ciesin.org/"&gt;Center for International Earth Science Information Network&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers multiplied the number of extremely hot days by the number of people in each city to get a total of “person-days”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in which city-dwellers experienced those extreme conditions. The number of person-days grew from 40 billion per year in 1983 to 119 billion in 2016 — showing how many more people are now suffering through extremely hot weather in the world’s cities. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hYHGM"&gt;Rising temperatures are responsible for about a third of the global spike in exposure, the study authors sussed out. The majority of the growth in exposure has to do with more people moving to urban areas. But that ratio can vary from city to city. The boom in population growth was the main driver of heat exposure in Delhi, India. But in Kolkata, climate change was a slightly bigger factor. The differences show that solutions likely need to be tailored to fit each city. Since cities &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html"&gt;continue to attract&lt;/a&gt; new residents and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;global average temperatures continue to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;rise, they’ll need to act fast.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kz8vpH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They’ll need to act fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VdeBtN"&gt;Cities can reach temperatures &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/learn-about-heat-islands"&gt;several degrees hotter&lt;/a&gt; than surrounding areas because of a process called the Urban Heat Island Effect. Asphalt and other dark surfaces absorb heat. Exhaust from factories and tailpipes release more heat. And there are fewer trees to give shade or plants to provide the cooling effect of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands"&gt;evapotranspiration&lt;/a&gt; (a process similar to how humans cool down by sweating). These effects tend to be worse in neighborhoods that have received less investment and more industrial activity over time, a phenomenon that other research has shown to take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;disproportionately heavy tolls on communities of color&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ2Ysl"&gt;Despite the growing risk, heat-related deaths are largely preventable. To cool down, cities can paint rooftops and other surfaces white to reflect heat. Bringing more trees and greenery to neighborhoods also helps. There’s also more that can be done to warn people of coming heatwaves so that they can find public cooling centers or other spots to ride out the heat with air conditioning. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/heat-check/"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573081/google-new-tool-hot-cities-trees-climate-change-temperature"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; are just a couple of the major metropolitan areas around the world working to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnzalD"&gt;“For billions of people on Earth, our study is retrospective. This is their lived experience every day,” Tuholske says. “We really need to learn from them and work with people in really hot cities to adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;Like clockwork, Apple announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; model at its September “California Streaming” event alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The Apple Watch Series 7 is the latest flagship and sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios. After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can preorder them on &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt; beginning Friday, October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWzYHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We will update this post as more retailers open up preorder listings, as well as Apple’s own direct links and finalized pricing for the full Series 7 range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LxippD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="TraF9d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0ZdgqF"&gt;The aluminum-encased Series 7 watches come in midnight, starlight, an updated blue, (PRODUCT) RED, and a new dark green colorway, so there is a bit to choose from whether you’re going for a discreet, bold, or rugged look. Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWKvlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10743503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2wxGivMl3xRoA_Lx7GJydjaaKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900348/Apple_watch_series7_availability_aluminum_10052021.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;With the impending release of the Apple Watch Series 7, you will be able to preorder your preferred configuration direct from Apple starting October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. If the Series 7 follows the same pricing convention as the Series 6, you should be able to outfit the 41mm version with a cellular connection for $100 more. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model will most likely run $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. We will confirm these Series 7 prices and update as soon as Apple announces pricing beyond the starting $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the USA will also offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan you might already have for your phone. We anticipate Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all offering the Series 7 in each of its colors at the same starting price as Apple for its cellular models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/applewatch/SID/https://www.att.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g50QyqEKJq0rPdmM51JUYxdmD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900357/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hermes_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Edition with Hermès strap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with Apple confirming the Series 7 is to be sold in stainless steel and titanium finishes, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches, and most people opt for the aluminum models, which offer the same functionality at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for outfitting the exact custom configuration of Apple Watch a customer chooses, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is up, Facebook is down, and Jack Dorsey is laughing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bitcoin Conference Draws Cryptocurrency Fans To Miami" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pq1Z5-9JUqzeUdW7RRl1jdvJGe4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949584/1321753430.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Ubovw"&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appears to be getting just as much schadenfreude out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;today’s global Facebook outage&lt;/a&gt; as anyone. The microblogging chief is tweeting through Facebook’s DNS issues by dunking on the company amid its latest round of scrutiny from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiFjvC"&gt;WhatsApp trying to be cute on Twitter? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1445080782335365125?s=20"&gt;Dorsey is there to remind you&lt;/a&gt; of the drama over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289595/whatsapp-privacy-policy-app-banner-explanation-telegram"&gt;WhatsApp’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDfEpkbvLt0mpxXhaUsJ0UaYBK8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900412/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.56.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9wD41t"&gt;Twitter users suggesting Facebook’s domain name is somehow for sale? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1445079948432117778?s=20"&gt;Dorsey wants a piece of the action&lt;/a&gt; — and to push &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1445085236933664770?s=20"&gt;Kanye West’s new album&lt;/a&gt; for some reason (to be clear, it does not appear that Facebook’s domain name is actually for sale, and Dorsey almost certainly knows this as well). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQwGOXZ_Sl3QDt-QT44jmYRvGRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900433/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.49.31_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IxOuj6"&gt;And honestly? I can’t blame him. For as hellish as I imagine fixing this issue is for the engineers at Facebook and anyone who relies on the company’s products for work, there is something undeniably delightful about spending a few hours without some of the biggest social networks in the world. It’s almost peaceful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0OLNQ"&gt;(Dorsey does seem to like dunking on his company’s biggest rival; he brought the snark for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/5/20949650/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-facebook-bland-new-logo-mock-tweet"&gt;Facebook’s rebrand&lt;/a&gt; and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931058/jack-dorsey-twitter-libra-association-join"&gt;so far disastrous first steps into cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4r7jG"&gt;However, even though it’s been some time since we’ve seen its fail whale, the next time Twitter suffers an outage (it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644376/twitter-down-outage-midwest-states"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22388685/twitter-partial-outage-saturday-east-coast"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128588/twitter-outage-down-issues-scheduled-tweets-work"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518367/twitter-down-outage-tweets"&gt;happen&lt;/a&gt;), Dorsey shouldn’t expect any sympathy from his rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UU3tVy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When Facebook goes down, an economy goes with it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Ring’s Halloween doorbell Chimes return and new spooky quick replies arrive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j9DbRFUWFfMkRGgUDKc1s1CShfU=/261x0:1674x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949373/Ring_Halloween_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring brings spooky ringtones to its video doorbells in time for Halloween.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eqLTYk"&gt;Following in the now annual tradition of the spooky smart home, Ring has released its seasonal ding dongs. In honor of the festive season, you can turn your Ring Video Doorbell’s interior Chime’s tone to a screeching cat, a creaky door, or my personal favorite, the creepy laugh, for the month of October. There are a handful of other scary tones also, nine in total, which is eight more than Google is offering on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699288/google-nest-doorbell-spooky-halloween-holiday-ringtones"&gt;its Nest doorbell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcnF2R"&gt;To up the spooky ante this year, Ring has a new trick as an extra treat: a selection of Halloween-themed Quick Replies, a free feature that lets your doorbell answer for you. Now, when a visitor presses the Ring buzzer, it can talk back to them with these additions to the standard preset responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76uMTC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Tell us what brings you here...or we’ll put a spell on you!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXSsU5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Boo! Leave us a message if you dare [evil laugh].”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBcwoU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Just a minute! Feel free to park your broom.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJon8p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Please leave the package (and any hocus pocus) outside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NCDGP"&gt;Personally, I’d like one that says, “All the candy is gone, move along now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGD3l9"&gt;Billed by Ring as the busiest doorbell day of the year, Halloween is definitely a day when a video doorbell shines. I’ve had hours of fun scaring trick or treaters — or UPS delivery drivers — in years past when the seasonal tones roll around. (Pro tip: plug the Chime in right by the front door, as the ringtone on the doorbell itself doesn’t change). Although, sadly, it seems the scare factor is wearing off somewhat as doorbell cameras become more ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUTMs1"&gt;However, the new Quick Replies come right from the doorbell itself, not through the Ring Chime, so they might have a bit more of fright factor. These launched today (the ringtones arrived in mid-September) and will be replaced by winter holiday-themed options at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lHyXvLqn6UB8p833xv0ibpATl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900187/Ring_Video_Doorbell_4_with_Halloween_Faceplate_Lifestyle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring wants to help you decorate your front door this season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kZupAF"&gt;The Quick Replies feature is available on all Ring doorbells other than the base model Ring Video Doorbell Wired. If you have a Ring Protect Plan, you can use it as an answering machine and view the recorded video and audio of the visitor in the app, but you don’t need a subscription for the replies themselves. You set up Quick Replies in the Ring App, which is also where you can change the ringtone on your Chime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqF033"&gt;If you (or your neighborhood) really get into the Halloween spirit, Ring is also releasing seasonal faceplates for the Ring Video Doorbell 2, 3, 3 Plus, and 4, which cost $14.99 each from the &lt;a href="http://Ring.com"&gt;Ring.com&lt;/a&gt; store. Choose from a spooky design with bats and spiderwebs, or opt for something less scary and more festive and fun, like pumpkins and leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2hqns"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Facebook down right now? This global outage is tough on everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufVdtjvxagzzrODMeyYf-yQ1-Pg=/315x0:1728x942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949303/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.06.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LOH1L8"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;something like Facebook drops off the internet&lt;/a&gt;, there are massive knock-on effects. For example, a website that’s meant to tell you if services are down, called Is It Down Right Now, is struggling mightily under the load of people trying to see Instagram’s status. Cloudflare, a company that runs a DNS service (DNS acts like a map for your web browser when it’s trying to find a website and is also the likely culprit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;when it comes to major outages&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?s=20"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’s had to mobilize extra resources to keep up with the traffic of people trying to load Facebook (or Instagram or WhatsApp) over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpJzYZ"&gt;If you need to check if other sites are down, you do still have options. There’s &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com"&gt;the venerable DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com"&gt;Down for Everyone or Just Me&lt;/a&gt; (DFEOJM informed me that it’s not just me having issues with Is It Down). I’m going to need all of you to decide between yourselves how to split up traffic between these two sites, so we don’t crash them too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZ91u_y2HjJ9H1v0YamzWdO_0Hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900268/Screen_Shot_2021_10_04_at_10.11.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a little awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="opQCm8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now, here's the fun part. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cloudflare?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; runs a free DNS resolver, 1.1.1.1, and lots of people use it. So Facebook etc. are down... guess what happens? People keep retrying. Software keeps retrying. We get hit by a massive flood of DNS traffic asking for &lt;a href="https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6"&gt;https://t.co/qq6U47Tjc6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— John Graham-Cumming (@jgrahamc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wiY7iP"&gt;In the hacking world, there’s something called a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, where attackers basically pool together tons of computing resources and use them to generate tons of traffic to a website. If they’ve got enough power, the website will go down — and that’s very likely what’s happened with Is It Down Right Now, except instead of malicious hackers, it’s half the internet accidentally overwhelming the service through sheer combined will. I guess that’s what happens when &lt;a href="https://status.fb.com"&gt;Facebook’s status page&lt;/a&gt; goes down along with the rest of its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="26rWHQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When Facebook goes down, an economy goes with it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A3SNbY"&gt;PS: there’s one funny side effect that comes from many people basically only using their internet connections for Facebook — many ISPs and cellular providers, like &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/att/"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and more, have also been reported as down, even though their services seem to be working fine. But because people can’t access Facebook, they may assume the problem is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin’s ideas to mimic SpaceX sound pretty brutal for employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eJj6J9eNJHVJinQExP_BOyhUKE=/193x0:2808x1743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949275/blue_origin_first_human_flight_l0_new_shepard_launch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tPrT5n"&gt;In an attempt to recreate SpaceX’s success, executives at spaceflight venture Blue Origin once praised the rival company’s “burnout” culture as a working labor strategy, with some managers arguing that Blue Origin needs to “get more” out of employees and encourage them to come in on the weekends. The grueling working strategies were summed up in a 2018 memo compiled by Blue Origin executives, a copy of which was viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oPgPy"&gt;Parts of the memo were quoted in &lt;a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past"&gt;an alarming Lioness essay published on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, which alleged a sexist and unsafe work culture at Blue Origin, founded by former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The essay was written by Alexandra Abrams, the former head of employee communications at Blue Origin, along with 20 present and past employees at the company. She detailed former executives who spoke in demeaning ways to women, as well as one who got fired after groping a female employee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;The essay also described a retaliatory culture&lt;/a&gt;, one in which people are too scared to speak up about safety issues for fear of losing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBoyTw"&gt;“In our experience, Blue Origin’s culture sits on a foundation that ignores the plight of our planet, turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs,” Abrams wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MOSPr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The lack of effort over weekends to meet deadlines is not culture I am accustomed to.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSGAmi"&gt;Abrams also described company executives as being impatient with slipping schedules, which resulted in them trying to find ways squeeze more productivity out of their employees. She cited the 2018 memo as an example of how Blue Origin hoped to be more aggressive like its competitor SpaceX. Executives created the memo after attending a briefing with Avascent, a strategy and management consultant. In the document, they summarized some of their biggest takeaways from the meeting, while highlighting some of the labor&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;concepts that SpaceX employs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IvK3x"&gt;“Very long hours are expected,” the memo says of SpaceX’s culture. “People are expected to work on vacations or not take them. Burnout is part of their labor strategy. It’s one reason they [sic] workforce tends to be on the younger side. They hired new grads eager to learn and performance [sic] and purposely burn them out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEhOmI"&gt;A Blue Origin executive later gives his advice on how Blue Origin should change, based on how SpaceX runs its business. “We need to get more out of our employees,” Gregory “Ray J” Johnson, a former astronaut and former Blue Origin manager, wrote. “The lack of effort over weekends to meet deadlines is not culture I am accustomed to in an operations outfit. I realize that development is somewhat different but regardless SpaceX expects and gets more out of their employees. It is a privilege to be a part of history. We are not necessarily slacking by any means but we may be less focused.” Elsewhere in the memo, it states that “Blue is a ghost town on weekends.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viewer-3cn8c"&gt;Blue Origin did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, the company did release a statement when the essay was first published. “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the company said. “We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct. We stand by our safety record and believe that New Shepard is the safest space vehicle ever designed or built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDoeAO"&gt;The Blue Origin memo seems to claim that SpaceX succeeds by “selling inspiration and guiding vision to employees,” thanks to strong branding and an active social media presence. And since these workers are hired at the beginning of their careers, they are “driven to work long hours,” with peer pressure a driving factor behind their schedules. As a result, SpaceX achieves “low cost relative to work output” and “high attrition with early burnout.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNvKHW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Blue is a ghost town on weekends.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYT03W"&gt;“They have a workforce aligned to accomplish the work for the least cost: utilization of early career engineers, who work 80 hours for below market compensation means they can produce drawings at a fast and cost effective pace,” Erik Sallee, a former corporate comptroller at Blue Origin, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV4vQo"&gt;Another strategy the memo cites is that SpaceX actively maintains a “bottom 10 percent” of its workforce, all of whom are automatically put on performance improvement plans or PIP. Other companies have also employed similar tactics, including Amazon, another company founded by Jeff Bezos. But the memo claims that SpaceX automatically lets go of the bottom 10 percent of its workforce each year “ensuring they have a clear path to a continually improving workforce,” Sallee wrote. The idea that companies should fire the 10 percent lowest performing employees was &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/paul-b-brown/should-you-fire-10-of-your-employees-every-year.html"&gt;famously championed by Jack Welch&lt;/a&gt;, the former CEO and chairman of General Electric. In January 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179258/spacex-layoffs-10-percent-work-force-dragon-capsule-satellite-internet-starship"&gt;SpaceX did announce that it was laying off 10 percent of its employees&lt;/a&gt; that year. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckIsGf"&gt;In response to this tactic, Jason Davis, a vice president of enterprise technology at Blue Origin, wrote that he didn’t necessarily want to put the bottom 10 percent of employees on automatic PIPs, but that “as an organization we need to be more forward/direct about our employee performance overall.” He also argued that he thinks “Blue is kind of lazy compared to SpaceX.” Another executive agreed that Blue needs to better communicate an expectation that employees work more than 40 hours a week. “I’m not advocating 80 hours a week, but we won’t get [New] Shepard to [first human flight] [New] Glenn to orbit or Engines delivered to ULA on 40 per week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJGIMB"&gt;Elsewhere, the memo cites other examples for SpaceX’s success, such as the fact that the company is mostly vertically integrated, practices iterative design, and designs its vehicles with lowering cost as a significant motivator. The executives seemed to agree that trending in these directions could make Blue Origin more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOkSWO"&gt;Abrams claims the primary motivation for writing the essay was concerns over Blue Origin’s vehicles being safe, given the structural problems within the company and how overworked the employees are. “Many of this essay’s authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle,” she wrote. “And no wonder—we have all seen how often teams are stretched beyond reasonable limits.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There are a just a few noteworthy features in this design-focused update&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RFWcqP"&gt;The most exciting thing about a big Android update is getting to try all of the new show-stopping features that’ll change the way you’ll use your phone. Android 12, which releases in a few weeks on Pixel phones (3 and up) and just a select few other devices later this year, is interesting because, well, it doesn’t have a bunch of those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNR8tG"&gt;I’ve been using Android 12 on the Pixel 3 since the first developer preview, and on the Pixel 4A 5G more recently during the latest release candidate. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22473033"&gt;Google announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it released the Android 12 source on Android Open Source Project (AOSP), but instead of releasing it broadly as it has in years past, Pixel owners will need to wait a few more weeks. A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s “putting the finishing touches on a special release with Pixel-exclusive and Pixel-first experiences on Android 12.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PpWGW"&gt;For the most part, it’s still Android. You can easily get by on the new update without using the smattering of new features that Google buried in the settings, though it’s worth seeking out a few of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP2yYF"&gt;The most obvious change, which is also the biggest incentive for most people to download Android 12, is Google’s new Material You design. The company says it’s the biggest design change in Android’s history. I agree that it’s significant, since it basically makes stock Android look like a really good custom launcher. There’s more color and more fun shapes throughout, and weirdest of all, widgets are officially a thing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syqR5csqL5OvtnWiQlcg836QUgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899749/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12’s design can look as loud or subdued as you’d like, and it doesn’t force you to use widgets if you don’t want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4D1oA-9Sk5eto1gI4hZ7wE68xUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899745/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This sun-shaped clock is probably the best widget Google has created yet. Let’s hope it has more up its sleeve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nNSmS3"&gt;The core design improvements in Android 12 further smooth over some of the operating system’s edges — quite literally. The animations you’ll see when you power on your device, turn it off, or plug in a charger all look refined and fluid. Notification pop-ups, items in the pull-down quick settings menu, the volume interface, and more have nice, rounded edges, nesting elegantly within the equally rounded corners of the displays on Pixel phones. In some cases, though, the refreshed design comes at the cost of information density. Power users might feel like they’re using a Fisher Price phone, particularly when it comes to how the pull-down menu looks, but others may not mind as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ1HsW"&gt;I’d say that the fit and finish of Android 12 is more polished than any other version at launch, except for a rather annoying bug with its at-a-glance widget at the top of the homescreen, which wouldn’t display the weather or other important calendar or traffic info during the beta, nor can it be fully turned off. Its menu had toggle switches with no descriptions next to them, and it was an eyesore. If Google fixes this in the final release, we’ll note that in the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="06DIkP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10788908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3L5Zou"&gt;Google’s goal with Material You is to unify the look of all of its disparate devices, including smart displays, phones, and anything else running Google software that has a screen. But for Android 12, the big visual overhaul is about giving you just a little more flexibility in making your phone feel more like your own. Leading the charge are many of Google’s long-forgotten widgets that have received a glow-up for Android 12. In case you are just now waking up after a five-year slumber, widgets are cool again, and even iOS has them. Having a colorful, sun-shaped clock and the “Your memories’’ widget from Google Photos on my homescreen looks great, and I’m really eager to see if more companies than just Google think it’s worth investing in making or updating widgets. Though I’ll admit, I’m a little scared to hold my breath here. A lot of the widgets, particularly third-party media players, still look like they haven’t gotten attention for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40KuPY"&gt;But even before we know if there will eventually be a rush of widgets vying for a spot on my homescreen, I think Google missed the obvious opportunity to adapt Apple’s widget stacks feature in iOS. Single-purpose widgets take up a lot of precious space, and with something like widget stacks, which lets you stack two or more widgets on top of each other and scroll through them as needed, it’d be possible to have both a functional homescreen and a good-looking one. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi26o0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;Android 11&lt;/a&gt; introduced support for custom themes, letting you adjust the font type, app icon shape, and color scheme. Android 12 has pared down the customization to focus just on what color you want to appear on some of the menus, buttons, widgets, and tiles on the quick settings pull-down menu, including the native media player seen within the notifications pane. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8pOA7CobN5Kt2tkQIjgSrHw6jQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899747/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wallpapers &amp;amp; style menu gives you a few more customization options in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0NJXI"&gt;You’ll find the “wallpapers &amp;amp; style” option by long-pressing on the homescreen, and from there you can choose a color from a palette that’s automatically generated from your wallpaper. I really love this. Though, if you just want to keep it simple, you can pick from one of four pastels that look different depending on whether you have light or dark mode activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUVdv8"&gt;Another small but nifty feature in this setting is “Themed Icons,” which attempts to dip all of your app icons in your preferred color for a more consistent look. In practice, many of Google’s apps played nicely with this feature during the beta, but not a single third-party app that I had installed did. Perhaps it’s intentional on Google’s part, opting to let non-Google apps pop with more color on your homescreen. Or maybe it’s that app makers may not want to voluntarily make their app icons less identifiable at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eo3td"&gt;Before I get to some of the other improvements that I’m glad to have in Android 12, I need to mention that I haven’t gotten over Google’s omission of the power menu, one of Android 11’s most well-executed ideas. By holding the power button, it used to let you easily access your Google Pay wallet, smart home gadgets, and power settings, all from one screen. Now, holding the power button will trigger the Google Assistant. You’ll find smart home device toggles and Google Pay relocated to the bottom right and left corners of the lock screen, mimicking the respective locations of the flashlight and camera buttons on iPhones. Alternatively, you can find them in the quick settings pull-down, if that’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Phone displaying Android 11 Beta" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z81yOA-WqcpnG4Rr8T06Tdpt-R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20026246/dbohn_200608_4059_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 11 nailed the now-defunct power menu (seen here).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMjEC4sw9caaDsSQzGZbB2kRkSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899842/android12gp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those same controls have been relocated to the bottom corners of the Android 12 lock screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGoPRF"&gt;You may not lament the power menu’s disappearance, but I think the big issue is that Google keeps changing how you access these increasingly vital functions. It’d just be great if Google could try to improve on its ideas without completely ditching them after one iteration of Android. It still lets people choose whether they want to experience Android with or without gestures, so why not also let them choose where they want to access mobile payments and smart home device controls? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmzdL9qkWrGlZ6oQ_6FXsZhTrSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899801/android12screens.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the broken At a Glance homescreen widget, the new-look pull-down menu, and the new scrolling screenshot feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L6gx6H"&gt;Outside of that, there are several tweaks that are additive to the Android experience, even if Apple or other Android OEMs beat Google to the punch. Regardless, it’s great that Google &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;added scrolling screenshots to the Pixel’s feature set. This lets you take screen grabs that span further down the page. Android 12 also debuts indicators that appear at the top of your phone when the camera or microphone are in use, just like the feature that appeared in iOS 14. There are even new quick setting tiles you can add to quickly be able to turn off the camera and / or microphone on the system level. Those tiles are going to get a lot of use from people, I expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmecPC"&gt;Also, when an app asks for your location, you can now specify in most cases whether you want to give the app approximate or precise location info, like in iOS. This year’s Android update also brings a one-handed mode that’s identical to Apple’s. Once it’s active within the gestures menu, just swipe your finger down on the bottom edge of the display to pull things within reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UwL_vtbWg9LJfXDXUSBPWYZD5WU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899752/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new privacy dashboard is accessible within the system settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NweM3wh1-Ci0u6lLU4AqYibn2iU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899753/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Quick Tap feature was available on the Pixel 4A that I tested, but not the Pixel 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMelXE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;Android 12’s new Privacy Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is worth checking out, too, since it keeps tabs on how often your apps are pinging for your location, requesting to access your call logs, or are tapping into your camera and microphone. Even if this isn’t something that you plan on monitoring often, it’s great that Google built more transparency than ever into the OS, showing what kind of access your apps have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="kGs6Da"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10788875"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j2VMbZ"&gt;If that didn’t seem to you like an overwhelming amount of features, you’re right. As my colleague Chaim Gartenberg mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;in this year’s iOS 15 review&lt;/a&gt;, these big updates are becoming smaller and subtler. After more than a decade of polish, these operating systems are no longer in need of vast reworkings every calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HXi0CA89bAI0Kd6NcEmEITEWEnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899854/Screenshot_20211004_102048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How some games will look with the Game dashboard feature switched on. It gives you the option to take screenshots, record footage, toggle do not disturb, as well as see frames per second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RpauYp"&gt;More features will come, though. Google will probably follow up with a few “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21002753/pixel-feature-drop-updates-robocall-screening-portrait-mode-duo-video-call"&gt;feature drops&lt;/a&gt;’’ in 2022. And, if they’re anything like previous ones, they’ll make owning a Pixel phone feel like an even more rewarding experience. Looking forward, there are rumors that Android 12.1 might bring more changes, particularly, multitasking improvements for foldable phones, a sector that Google itself may be joining soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tdo6XeiVBGQ2Q8mFGhn7DCxrU5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899751/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the stock wallpapers look incredible when used with the new Material You widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ltViEPolTZLhUVKceL2-RgE_Vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899748/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s possible to go with a more understated look, too, with icon colors to match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJcpzy"&gt;In reviewing a new Android update, I thought about how these changes and features will impact all Android phones. But the thing is, right now Android 12 is really only good news for Pixel users, and it might be that way for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZougoE"&gt;According to this &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html"&gt;Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;, Google says Android 12 is coming to “Pixel in the next few weeks and Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices later this year.” We’ll update this review once Google shares specifics on the models that will receive Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a8ODL"&gt;Each of those phones use their own custom Android wrapper with its own design ID. So, while many of Android 12’s new features should make the jump, it’s possible that Google’s big Material You design push may not appear, at least with the same amount of customization that you’d find on Pixel, on every other phone that gets the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="QCQlln"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10789089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflhjZyYlhhq9_kTXsLfZ2Pl4HE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899754/cfaulkner_211004_4791_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, Google is using more of the Pixel’s always-on display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xbUkpj"&gt;Samsung is a big manufacturer missing from the list of devices getting Android 12 today. Though, it has already committed to bringing the software to its Galaxy S21 lineup from earlier this year in the form of its OneUI 4 update. A hands-on with the beta software &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/one-ui-4-beta-features-overview/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that Samsung’s take on Android 12 doesn’t seem to have the same pizzazz as Google’s treatment on Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kcGiJI"&gt;Android 12 isn’t an update that’s trying to change how you use your phone — not that it needed to be. Instead of just tacking on dozens of new features, Google just wanted to shake things up in the design department for the sake of it. It’s an upheaval of some of Android’s smallest details. It amounts to a more customizable experience, which in turn lets your phone look and feel more unique. If that gets you excited, you probably won’t regret installing. But I wouldn’t buy a Pixel just to experience Android 12. And if you can’t get the update today, I wouldn’t fret too much until more features are added.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 will be coming to Pixel phones in the ‘next few weeks’</title>

  &lt;p id="WAmjlA"&gt;Google’s latest major Android update, Android 12, isn’t available to the general public just yet, but it’s getting closer. The company wrote on its &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html"&gt;Android Developers site&lt;/a&gt; that it pushed the source to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is “officially” releasing the update. Despite Android 12 being technically available, you won’t find it appearing as an update on your Pixel phone for the “next few weeks,” according to the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QyOrt"&gt;When it does launch, it’ll come to the Pixel 3, Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; phones (wow, Google sure makes a lot of these now). It’s the software that you’ll see on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; when those launch later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaC2XP"&gt;According to Google, it’ll also come to Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo7JaI"&gt;In case you’re curious what’s what with Android 12, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22472761"&gt;I’ve got a review of the software&lt;/a&gt;, which I tested extensively on both a Pixel 3 and Pixel 4A 5G. It’s an update that is mostly focused on tweaking the way Android looks with Google’s new Material You design language. There are other features worth trying, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;including a new privacy dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that offers up more transparency on how your apps access your location, microphone, and camera, but overall, it’s not an update that aims to drastically alter how you use your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5vAPn"&gt;If you need an extra hand with downloading and installing the update when it comes, we’ll be putting up a step-by-step guide for doing that on your Pixel or other supported phone, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is down, along with Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus VR</title>

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s entire network of services suddenly went offline. On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems are widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms are unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — have been “withdrawn from the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l3G5TB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook down right now? This global outage is tough on everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"},{"title":"Twitter is up, Facebook is down, and Jack Dorsey is laughing ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/4/22709235/twitter-jack-dorsey-dunk-facebook-outage-dns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="x5968t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing Facebook app. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook App (@facebookapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/facebookapp/status/1445060225468297216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jijz8O"&gt;&lt;a href="http://Instagram.com"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; is flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely tells us that something went wrong. The problem also appears to be affecting its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users can load games they already have installed and the browser works, but social features or installing new games does not. The outage is thorough enough that it’s affecting Workplace from Facebook customers and, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1445058298034614278?s=21"&gt;according to Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s internal sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgO9qf"&gt;There’s no word yet from Facebook about what may be causing the problem or when those sites, including Messenger and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1445060216161116168"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, will be operational again, but we will update this article with more information when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
