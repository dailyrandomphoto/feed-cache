    <title>DeepMind tests the limits of large AI language systems with 280-billion-parameter model</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YCGXgS"&gt;Language generation is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734662/ai-language-artificial-intelligence-future-models-gpt-3-limitations-bias"&gt;hottest thing in AI&lt;/a&gt; right now, with a class of systems known as “large language models” (or LLMs) being used for everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443441/google-ai-language-models-dangers-risk-io-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing"&gt;improving Google’s search engine&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042942/ai-dungeon-nick-walton-openai-gpt2-text-adventure-game-web-version-launch"&gt;creating text-based fantasy games&lt;/a&gt;. But these programs also have serious problems, including regurgitating sexist and racist language and failing tests of logical reasoning. One big question is: can these weaknesses be improved by simply adding more data and computing power, or are we reaching the limits of this technological paradigm? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0ztqP"&gt;This is one of the topics that Alphabet’s AI lab DeepMind is tackling in a trio of research papers published today. The company’s conclusion is that scaling up these systems further should deliver plenty of improvements. “One key finding of the paper is that the progress and capabilities of large language models is still increasing. This is not an area that has plateaued,” DeepMind research scientist Jack Rae told reporters in a briefing call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b36D63"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not an area that has plateaued.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G5zmBg"&gt;DeepMind, which regularly feeds its work into Google products, has probed the capabilities of this LLMs by building a language model with 280 billion parameters named Gopher. Parameters are a quick measure of a language’s models size and complexity, meaning that Gopher is larger than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-3 &lt;/a&gt;(175 billion parameters) but not as big as some more experimental systems, like Microsoft and Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/12/nvidia_microsoft_mtnlg/"&gt;Megatron model&lt;/a&gt; (530 billion parameters). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQq635"&gt;It’s generally true in the AI world that bigger is better, with larger models usually offering higher performance. DeepMind’s research confirms this trend and suggests that scaling up LLMs does offer improved performance on the most common benchmarks testing things like sentiment analysis and summarization. However, researchers also cautioned that some issues inherent to language models will need more than just data and compute to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fgfks"&gt;“I think right now it really looks like the model can fail in variety of ways,” said Rae. “Some subset of those ways are because the model just doesn’t have sufficiently good comprehension of what it’s reading, and I feel like, for those class of problems, we are just going to see improved performance with more data and scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sawSU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not all problems with AI language systems can be solved with scale&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IQDwRG"&gt;But, he added, there are “other categories of problems, like the model perpetuating stereotypical biases or the model being coaxed into giving mistruths, that [...] no one at DeepMind thinks scale will be the solution [to].” In these cases, language models will need “additional training routines” like feedback from human users, he noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rstqKE"&gt;To come to these conclusions, DeepMind’s researchers evaluated a range of different-sized language models on 152 language tasks or benchmarks. They found that larger models generally delivered improved results, with Gopher itself offering state-of-the-art performance on roughly 80 percent of the tests selected by the scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMbaKN"&gt;In another paper, the company also surveyed the wide range of potential harms involved with deploying LLMs. These include the systems’ use of toxic language, their capacity to share misinformation, and their potential to be used for malicious purposes, like sharing spam or propaganda. All these issues will become increasingly important as AI language models become more widely deployed — as chatbots and sales agents, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oblXC6"&gt;However, it’s worth remembering that performance on benchmarks is not the be-all and end-all in evaluating machine learning systems. In a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15366.pdf"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, a number of AI researchers (including two from Google) explored the limitations of benchmarks, noting that these datasets will always be limited in scope and unable to match the complexity of the real world. As is often the case with new technology, the only reliable way to test these systems is to see how they perform in reality. With large language models, we will be seeing more of these applications very soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new professional profiles let creators unlock audience-growing tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJynu9pdQzLJao09Ky3OdWj8LAQ=/0x0:1302x868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244554/professional_mode_facebook.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Turning on professional mode lets creators earn money for their Reels. | Photo by Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yD2OPi"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/professional-mode-for-profiles"&gt;rolling out professional mode for profiles&lt;/a&gt;, letting creators take advantage of additional monetization tools. The new mode also gives creators access to features that help track the growth of their audience, something that was previously only available with Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xn5JAY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Professional mode lets creators partake in the Reels Play bonus program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N1iLCt"&gt;Turning on professional mode allows creators to partake in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses"&gt;Reels Play bonus program&lt;/a&gt;. Reels, Instagram’s short-term video feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700289/facebook-reels-instagram-play-bonus-tiktok"&gt;became available on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; in September. The bonus program lets creators earn up to $35,000 / month, all depending on how many views their Reels rack up. However, all creators aren’t eligible for the program — it’s currently invite-only, and creators must comply with Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/169845596919485?id=2520940424820218"&gt;Partner Monetization Policies&lt;/a&gt; to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEiHJs"&gt;Additionally, Facebook says it’s working on more advanced editing features for Reels, such as an easier way to create a Reel comprised of multiple clips, as well as the ability to save your Reel as a draft while you’re in the process of editing it. The platform is also considering extending the length limit of Reels from 30 seconds to one minute on Facebook, as only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596530/instagram-reels-60-seconds-time-extension"&gt;Instagram supports one-minute Reels&lt;/a&gt; at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZpuZfu26U7TTZLNMSCGghOPKx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23072853/facebook_professional_page_dashboard.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professional mode unlocks a dashboard for audience insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUPDXX"&gt;Outside of Reels, professional mode also unlocks audience, post, and profile insights, which lets creators keep track of any activity on their profile. Creators can review the total number of shares, comments, and reactions that their posts have received and can also see how their follower count has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLMRu"&gt;Similar to Pages, enabling professional mode makes all the content you post public and means that anyone can view your profile and start following you. Meta says that you can still choose to make certain posts visible to friends only, however. Professional mode is only available in the US for now, but Meta says it’ll be coming to more countries “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15hCwZ"&gt;Just yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/stars-fest-is-here"&gt;Facebook introduced&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://fb.com/stars"&gt;Stars store&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated website for purchasing Stars — otherwise known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687603/facebook-creators-stars-subscriptions-supporter-groups"&gt;the virtual currency&lt;/a&gt; that users can buy with real money and use to tip creators. While Stars are available for purchase within the Facebook app, the Stars on Facebook’s new store are offered at a discounted price. The platform may be trying to entice users to purchase Stars on the web-based Stars store, likely to skirt the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; that Apple takes for purchases made in third-party apps on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla allows drivers to play video games in moving cars, raising safety concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwCV64p7GydX-hI2pjeCNmL8oRY=/0x140:3341x2367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244439/IMG_0832.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You could play Sky Force Reloaded while driving — but you shouldn't. | Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJxKd8"&gt;Tesla updated its software allowing vehicle occupants to play video games on the center touchscreen while in motion, raising questions about safety and driver distraction. Previously, video games were only playable while the vehicle was in park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoGkWt"&gt;But according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an over-the-air software update was pushed out last summer enabling the ability to launch some games regardless of whether the car was stationary or not, raising serious concerns about safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8v2mEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the ability to play video games while the vehicle is in motion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ddgqmY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed in a Tesla Model 3 that &lt;em&gt;Sky Force Reloaded&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Solitaire&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Battle of Polytopia&lt;/em&gt; are playable on the center touchscreen while the vehicle is in motion. A notification asks the player to confirm they aren’t the driver before launching the game, but the message is hardly a deterrent. A driver could easily tap “I AM A PASSENGER” and play a complex action game like &lt;em&gt;Sky Force&lt;/em&gt; while in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying the warning prompt on a black background to confirm you are a passenger, allowing you to tap a button to continue the game." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4E5Ol-Le2meNHOodGTXhStJrVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071674/IMG_0834.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-check if you’re a passenger﻿&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BUYLPd"&gt;Some interactive apps in the car worked in motion even before the update, including the drawing pad and the Karaoke mode in music — which also warns the driver not to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RD8nUn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf9TAl"&gt;A Model 3 owner told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that he had filed a complaint to the NHTSA upon discovery of the games being playable while driving in his car. That complaint won’t be a first. Tesla currently has &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/AWD"&gt;59 complaints&lt;/a&gt; from owners regarding the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo6OMY"&gt;A spokesperson for NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-safety-agency-discussing-video-game-feature-with-tesla-2021-12-08/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was “discussing” the issue of playable video games in moving cars with the company. “Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. “We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying a video game running with a jet craft flying over an ocean, while also displaying the status of the Tesla vehicle in drive and running on autopilot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyfET7aS2WUCIt62fHZa8k-RSn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071692/IMG_0828.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Force running while on Autopilot. Don’t try this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9mX3H"&gt;Tesla has a reputation for regularly skirting safety rules and ignoring regulator recommendations for improvements. The company offers a version of its Level 2 advanced driver assist system called “Full Self-Driving,” which does not make its vehicles autonomous and requires drivers to stay vigilant while in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Wwdc"&gt;The US government has taken a renewed interest in Tesla, recently announcing that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSSz0"&gt;NHTSA is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;seeking more information from Tesla&lt;/a&gt; about the growing public beta test of FSD, the recently launched “Safety Score” evaluation process for entering the program, and the nondisclosure agreements Tesla was making participants sign up until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center display is showing a list of games in stacked squares that can be selected, and a button to play the game is visible on the screen though cannot be activated." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmJ1ASdjBz8EeB-dT7O0JKk9OoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071721/IMG_0831.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously released games like Cat Quest block the ability to launch the game while driving, a better way for Tesla to discourage unsafe behaviors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6mGj"&gt;Touchscreens in vehicles are quickly becoming the norm as manufacturers continue to remove tactile buttons and knobs from their vehicles. Many vehicles are becoming more dangerous as a result. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, drivers can get distracted and look away from the road for up to 40 seconds per task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HpDh0"&gt;Tesla has pioneered the use of over-the-air software updates in the auto industry, using smartphone-style updates to add features like improved driver assistance to silly Easter eggs like “James Bond mode” to its electric vehicles. The company has also rolled out a whole suite of video games it calls Tesla Arcade (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;we tried it out on a Model 3 back in 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3meHK9"&gt;Tesla has started using an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457430/tesla-in-car-camera-driver-monitoring-system"&gt;interior camera&lt;/a&gt; to monitor drivers for its Full Self-Driving beta program, which allows drivers to use automatic steering, lane-keeping, and adaptive cruise control on local, non-highway streets. But the vast majority of Tesla vehicles do not use any cameras to track driver eye movements to ensure they are keeping their attention on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Masahiro Sakurai on the future of Smash: ‘I’ve been doing too much of the work myself’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iG8jRTHYwWLgzAJGWcPHz1hllNU=/0x118:1339x1011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244366/Sakurai_pic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZsja8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; is finally complete. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;launching in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;a roster that included every single character from the series’ long history&lt;/a&gt;, it has since been steadily updated with new fighters, culminating in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;the addition of Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The game’s last major update &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/1466218355262697472"&gt;came on December 1st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIDzTg"&gt;Three years and countless charming video presentations later, series creator Masahiro Sakurai — &lt;a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/sakurai-on-smash-bros-ultimate-his-health-choosing-bosses-and-spirits-new-stages-much-more/"&gt;an infamous workaholic&lt;/a&gt; — seems to finally be taking it easy. “I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over email. That career has been tightly intertwined with &lt;em&gt;Smash, &lt;/em&gt;a series he has not only led but also been a key developer on for more than two decades.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other,” he says of his time working on the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fni5Sw"&gt;With development on &lt;em&gt;Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; wrapping up, there’s been much discussion on the future of the franchise — and particularly whether Sakurai would still be involved. I had the chance to ask the director a few questions over email, and we talked about working on new fighters, taking time off, and where &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5n7Dg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxlw7L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the game was first announced at E3 2018, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you told me how daunting the prospect of creating such a large roster was&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How did the post-launch development, and adding all of these new fighters, compare to that initial development process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62dN6i"&gt;You may have already noticed, but DLC fighters tend to be more uniquely made compared to standard fighters on the roster. Some sort of new in-game system is implemented, their Final Smash is accompanied by a visual sequence, they have a relatively elaborate stage setup and guests, and their battle tactics and in-game systems clearly set them apart from other existing fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl8sKW"&gt;Fans are paying extra for these additional characters, so we tell ourselves that we need to strive and do our best to deliver content that is more than worthy. Given that, adding one piece of DLC fighter and their accompanying stages, music, and other content proved to be a greater challenge than adding one piece of content in the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cov4Lp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that it’s finished, how does the final product compare to what you originally envisioned for the game? Are there elements you are particularly proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxpwj1"&gt;We envision the finished product and aim for that as we work on the game, so where we landed is certainly not too far from that initial vision. Even so, I feel that there are still some shortcomings, which I took as lessons learned. I have a feeling the notion of “being proud of” differs between Japanese and English, but I do not wish to boast about what we have accomplished with this project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="29iso0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. “&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3bUAXU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After working on it for so long, was it hard to finally step away from the game? What was it like when you realized work was complete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oGLGd"&gt;I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. This was a large-scale project that spanned many years, but even for a project like this, we still apply the same amount of effort to each step as with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s1Ehf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you managed to take any time off since Sora launched? What does a break for you look like (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1459390846709551112"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aside from riding horses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx26dx"&gt;Usually, I like to go on drives. I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development, so I occasionally go on short trips, overnight or just a day trip. My itinerary gets fairly packed since I like to make stops here and there. Also, it is fortunate that the COVID-19 situation in Japan has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKXxC9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever have regrets about not being able to work on projects outside of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; over the last few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ydSwd"&gt;I do sometimes look back and think about the fact that there may have been other opportunities had I not been working on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; However, I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other, and this was an opportunity that I could not have gained with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Moks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would convince you to come back to make another &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? Do you think, if you did return, your role would be different or reduced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XXd7m"&gt;I think we’ve reached the limit, at least in terms of volume of content and fighters. Basically, if I were to have the opportunity to work on another &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; game, that means we would have to shrink the roster, but we need to think about whether fans would be pleased about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVOTnx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The current ‘Super Smash Bros.’ has too much of my personality poured into it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo6vO1"&gt;Also, I’ve been doing too much of the work myself, so I’d need to resolve that, too. The current &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; has too much of my personality poured into it. In order for a long-time series to continue thriving today, we need to think about eliminating the series’ dependence on just one person’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxXQHy"&gt;Of course, this is the way it is now because we weren’t successful in splitting the vision between multiple people before. This would be a challenge for the future and something that needs to be discussed with Nintendo, if there were to be a next installment in the &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJ5gAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07Z9W0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GTA Online’s next big update brings back Franklin and adds Dr. Dre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49uatkgJhC3aPXBvHyv_Zycqqzk=/117x37:1137x717/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244297/gta_online_contract.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CuByLA"&gt;Rockstar Games is releasing new story content for &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; featuring Franklin Clinton, one of the key characters from &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;. In lieu of releasing standalone single-player expansions, the company is &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51ko98182a41o9/introducing-the-contract-a-new-gta-online-story-featuring-franklin-cli?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_the-contract-20211208"&gt;weaving new story-focused missions&lt;/a&gt; into its massive online mode on December 15th. Despite what sounds like a more low-key approach, Rockstar seems to be going big with this one, including Dr. Dre’s likeness, as well as new, unreleased music from the legendary rapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3ZarM"&gt;The story apparently picks up in the years following the events that transpire in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;, and Rockstar got Franklin’s voice actor, Shawn Fonteno, to reprise the role. Aside from new missions, the content drop will include lots of new music. There will be a new radio station, as well as “huge first-of-their-kind updates to existing radio stations including a ton of new and unreleased exclusive tracks from Dr. Dre and a heavy-hitting line-up of artists,” says Rockstar. There will also be new side missions, weapons, and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

Many took that to mean it would debut at a much later date in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto 6&lt;/em&gt; (which itself has yet to be confirmed by Rockstar Games), but players will be able to listen to Dr. Dre’s latest songs sooner than they might have expected. This new content will arrive as a free update that’s available to all &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram head Mosseri to face questions about child safety in Senate hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7Hav0GIvwIV9pZjTigHfpX9FGY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244271/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5W6XR"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, head of Instagram Adam Mosseri will appear before a Senate Commerce subcommittee to answer questions about whether the photo-sharing app is harmful to children’s health. It’s Mosseri’s first appearance before Congress and the first hearing to specifically address Instagram separately from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li0m6S"&gt;The hearing, titled Protecting Kids Online: Instagram and Reforms for Young Users, will be &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/12/protecting-kids-online-instagram-and-reforms-for-young-users"&gt;streamed live from the Senate&lt;/a&gt; beginning at 2:30PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bECky1"&gt;Instagram has been the focus of growing concern from lawmakers and parents, following a bombshell &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Those documents suggested that Facebook was well aware that Instagram is “toxic” for its teenage users and that its algorithms could direct them to content that may encourage self-harm. Lawmakers have said they want to toughen child privacy laws, including updating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and are seeking broader reforms aimed specifically at Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QloKUN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parents ... have a right to know the truth about the safety of Instagram.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bcyvd1"&gt;In October, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding the company explain how Instagram plans to protect children. He later extended the invitation to Mosseri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbg0SJ"&gt;“Parents across America are deeply disturbed by ongoing reports that Facebook knows that Instagram can cause destructive and lasting harms to many teens and children, especially to their mental health and wellbeing,” &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf"&gt;Blumenthal wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Those parents, and the twenty million teens that use your app, have a right to know the truth about the safety of Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eD1Wo"&gt;Blumenthal has called for new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747330/snap-tiktok-youtube-facebook-papers-blumenthal-coppa-kids-child-safety"&gt;online child safety measures&lt;/a&gt; to address concerns around the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezwu63"&gt;Pressure is also mounting from anti-tech groups outside of Congress. On Tuesday, the Tech Transparency Project &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/xanax-ecstasy-and-opioids-instagram-offers-drug-pipeline-kids"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; claiming Instagram’s algorithms are recommending drug dealers’ accounts to underage users on the platform. Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Instagram parent company Meta, said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/instagram-pushes-drug-content-teens-rcna7751"&gt;to NBC News&lt;/a&gt; that the platform does not allow drug sales, and that it would “continue to improve in this area in our ongoing efforts to keep Instagram safe, particularly for our youngest community members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhACCm"&gt;Concerns about Instagram became particularly relevant in March, when news &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; that parent company Facebook was planning a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;version of Instagram for children under age 13&lt;/a&gt;. Reaction was &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22385570/instagram-for-kids-youtube-facebook-messenger"&gt;swift and mostly negative&lt;/a&gt;, with public health experts urging the company to reconsider, &lt;a href="https://fairplayforkids.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/instagram_letter.pdf"&gt;saying in an April letter&lt;/a&gt; that such a platform would “put young users at great risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9ktBi"&gt;Facebook said in September it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;“pausing” work on the kids version of Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, with Mosseri insisting that the pause was not “a concession that the project is a bad idea.” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUU3AM9AaIx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;ig_rid=af386193-8761-41af-b94b-e78d8f4c528a"&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt; at the time that he believed “parents would prefer the option for their children to use an age-appropriate version of Instagram — that gives them oversight — than the alternative. But I’m not here to downplay their concerns, we have to get this right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HHAdk"&gt;Instagram has already made some minor product changes aimed at addressing concerns around unhealthy usage in advance of the hearing. On Tuesday, the platform rolled out the “Take a Break” feature it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;started testing last month&lt;/a&gt;, to users in the United States and other English-speaking countries. The feature prompts users to pause using the app after they’ve been using it for a certain time period. Take a Break is opt-in, but the company said a test of the feature showed that 90 percent of users will leave the reminders on once set. More parental controls over their teenagers’ use of Instagram will be released next year, &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/raising-the-standard-for-protecting-teens-and-supporting-parents-online"&gt;Mosseri wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post announcing the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPK2r1"&gt;Mariana Ruiz Firmat, executive director of nonprofit advocacy organization Kairos Action, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that she remained skeptical of Instagram’s motives. “They don’t want to move young people off the platform,” Firmat said, “because they’re making so much money from young people on their platforms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anfJ31"&gt;Firmat added that she’s not encouraged by any of the new regulations Instagram announced Tuesday and doesn’t see the Take a Break feature as all that impressive. “They’re looking at young people as a primary target for their profit margin, so it’s hard to imagine they’re going to really change anything right now,” she said. “The platform is way too enticing and addictive to young users.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku settles YouTube dispute and locks down apps in ‘multi-year’ deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44iguyJWJvPtvclOTEijl986rw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244236/DSCF3621_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cnZz6h"&gt;Roku has reached a deal with Google to continue distributing the YouTube and YouTube TV apps on its platform. The two had been at odds over a contract extension, sparring over what Roku described as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;onerous demands&lt;/a&gt; by Google for more data and more prominent placement on its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfIeay"&gt;If they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22820988/roku-google-youtube-december-9-deadline"&gt;hadn’t reached an agreement by tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, Google planned to pull the YouTube app from Roku — a loss for basically everyone involved, but especially Roku users who would have no longer been able to download a key video service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmEijN"&gt;“This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform,” Dallas Lawrence, a Roku spokesperson, wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Google confirmed the deal to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and said both apps will be available through the Roku store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7cjso"&gt;Roku described the deal as a “multi-year extension” for YouTube and YouTube TV. YouTube TV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;pulled by Roku from its channel store&lt;/a&gt; in April as tensions between the two parties escalated. After months of stalled negotiations, Google said in late October that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738333/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-contract-competition-klobuchar"&gt;it would pull the YouTube app on December 9th&lt;/a&gt; if a deal hadn’t been reached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japanese billionaire launches to the International Space Station while waiting for SpaceX Moon ride</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RUSSIA-JAPAN-SPACE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwCPvg-FqlcAnj0wvEeP3fJ-RFI=/0x143:3716x2620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244129/1235877589.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(From L to R) Yusaku Maezawa, Alexander Misurkin, and Yozo Hirano&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by SHAMIL ZHUMATOV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SNbe1u"&gt;Three new spacefarers launched to the International Space Station this morning, a crew consisting of a Russian cosmonaut and two Japanese space tourists. One of the tourists on board was Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;announced his intention a few years back to fly around the Moon on SpaceX’s future Starship rocket one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NxSdO"&gt;The trio lifted off on top of a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan at 2:38AM ET, docking with the space station around six hours later at 8:40AM ET. Maezawa’s crewmates include Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin and Japenese tourist Yozo Hirano, who is Maezawa’s producer and manager. The group is slated to spend roughly 12 days on the ISS before heading back to Earth on December 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GDJpzt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;part of Russia’s reemergence into the world of orbital space tourism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TysFHG"&gt;Their trip is part of Russia’s reemergence into the world of orbital space tourism. The flight comes just two months after Russia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709501/russia-soyuz-launch-actress-producer-filming-movie-space-station"&gt;launched a Russian actress and director to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; to film scenes for an upcoming movie called &lt;em&gt;The Challenge&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, Maezawa and Hirano are flying to the ISS through a partnership with Space Adventures, a company that brokers trips to space for interested tourists. The company helped orchestrate trips to the ISS for seven people in the early 2000s on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. However, it paused flights after the retirement of NASA’s Space Shuttle in 2011, as the space agency needed seats on Russia’s Soyuz rockets to get US astronauts and international partners to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WySRAk"&gt;With the help of Space Adventures, Maezawa went through training in Russia’s Star City to help prepare for his flight. Maezawa plans to film his time on the ISS with the help of Hirano and post videos of his adventures on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3gOWCjoz9aeXdSUt6Fhmw"&gt;his YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Before his flight, Maezawa also came up with a list of “100 things to do in space,” &lt;a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20211016/p2g/00m/0sc/014000c"&gt;according to Space Adventures&lt;/a&gt;. One of the items he hopes to do on his list is play badminton with Misurkin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yusaku Maezawa standing in front of a Falcon 9 rocket at SpaceX’s headquarters, ahead of his Dear Moon announcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zQmQyg"&gt;Maezawa, who made his fortune through an online fashion retail business called Zozotown, has already made his interest in spaceflight well known. The billionaire announced in 2018 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869990/elon-musk-spacex-lunar-mission-ticket-moon-passenger-bfr-falcon-yusaku-maezawa"&gt;he had purchased a trip around the Moon on SpaceX’s future Starship rocket&lt;/a&gt;, a vehicle the company is building to take people to the lunar surface and Mars someday. For that mission, dubbed Dear Moon, Maezawa plans to bring up to eight people with him along for the journey. Originally he had hoped to bring all artists with him, but in March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309546/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-dear-moon-spacex"&gt;he launched a contest to allow anyone around the world to apply to fly with him&lt;/a&gt;, “to give as many talented individuals as possible the opportunity to go.” Maezawa also announced plans in 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/12/21062584/spacex-yusaku-maezawa-japan-billionaire-starship-girlfriend-contest-moon"&gt;film a dating reality show to find a girlfriend to go to space with him&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114712/yusaku-maezawa-space-girlfriend-not-happening"&gt;that idea was eventually abandoned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUmtPJ"&gt;In July, Maezawa posted a video of some of the filmed applications sent to him by people who were interested in flying around the Moon with him. In the video, he said his team was in the final stages of screening to pick the finalists. Meanwhile, SpaceX’s Starship rocket has yet to fly to orbit. The company has flown prototypes of the rocket to high altitudes above the Earth and attempted to land them back on the ground. Only one of those prototypes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421845/spacex-starship-sn15-successful-landing"&gt;has been able to stick the landing without exploding afterward&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX is working toward its first orbital launch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da3iF2Np51A"&gt;in either January or February 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Even if that is a success, there are still plenty of milestones the company must achieve before it can safely fly people to the vicinity of the Moon and then land them back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZV8RB"&gt;With Starship’s timeline somewhat dubious, this trip to the ISS is a much speedier way for Maezawa get his space fix while he waits. Maezawa and his crew will join two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, and a German astronaut from the European Space Agency who are already living on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat is even more affordable today </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rikk4ve-Dbaex2opcFzYLFT5Tg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244108/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Alexa app to control Amazon’s Smart Thermostat, which is currently enjoying its first discount.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="85aJOu"&gt;Even without a discount attached to it, Amazon’s surprisingly great Smart Thermostat is a good deal in itself. After our reviewer spent a decade testing almost every smart thermostat since the launch of the Nest Learning Thermostat, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it to be one of the best yet. That’s saying a lot, and it’s pretty impressive given this is an affordable smart thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJWOjc"&gt;The thermostat is discounted for the first time today, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $47.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — a 20 percent discount on its typical $59.99. Built in collaboration with Honeywell Home, this gadget is capable of learning and adapting to your schedule, just like more expensive thermostats out there. With the price in mind, it does lack some features. Perhaps the most egregious omission is that it doesn’t integrate with platforms or voice assistants besides Alexa. Yet, if you’re looking for a good basic thermostat with which you can control the temperature of your home (even while traveling), this is definitely worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="took9t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0OPc"&gt;Sonos is offering great deals on its refurbished products through December 31st. You can buy, for example, the latest generation of the Sonos One for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeDeals120821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fone-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $100 less than its full $219 retail cost when purchased new. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16490866/sonos-one-speaker-review-alexa"&gt;first-generation&lt;/a&gt; is also on sale for $129, but lacks Bluetooth Low Energy support, has a slower processor, and comes with less memory than the second-gen. Meanwhile, the first-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt; soundbar is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8532386-11556673?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-white-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$259&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the price when purchased new. While it lacks Dolby Atmos support like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZAD3l"&gt;All of the discounted refurbished products will arrive in a box with the original accessories and cables. They’ve also been certified directly from Sonos, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. Each product also comes with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N3fELm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="TMUytT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDSO0B"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to bulkier headphones, you might want to grab the second-gen Apple AirPods at Amazon since they’re just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt;. That matches its second-lowest price after we saw the earbuds drop to $89 during early Black Friday sales. It’s also a lower price than what we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. Typically around $129, this model offers excellent wireless performance, reliable battery life, and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zVYh9F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y89YAm"&gt;If you’ve got a little more cash to spare, and you’re in the market for a pair of excellent over-ear headphones, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals120821"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling Sony’s WH-1000XM4 with Mophie’s Power Boost XXL 20,800mAh battery power bank for just $248. That matches the Black Friday and Cyber Monday price many retailers sold the $349.99 headphones for just by themselves. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95 itself, so this bundle is valued at around $390. Plus, the bundle also includes a small microfiber cleaning cloth to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6501a"&gt;As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; (and as you’ve probably read in our deals coverage many times before), Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM4 boast the company’s best noise-canceling capabilities yet. We gave the headphones a 9/10 partly because of it, along with their stellar comfort, sound quality, and the fact they also let you connect to two Bluetooth sources simultaneously (this was missing in the XM3). Meanwhile, Mophie’s portable power bank comes with two USB-A ports so you can charge your headphones and phone simultaneously, and it charges via Micro USB. The company claims as well that its 20,800mAh battery offers up to 77 hours of extra battery life, but note we haven’t tested this product, so we can’t confirm if this is truly the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfWTW"&gt;Of course, if you prefer to just buy the headphones by themselves, many are still selling them for just $248, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gyfQV3mV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="90yl6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezhNoP"&gt;Govee’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt; are fun, colorful lights that can make watching movies and gaming look more immersive. They sync to the colors on your screen (it supports 55- to 65-inch TVs) to make it appear as if its bezels have disappeared and the colors are expanding onto your walls. In other words, they’ll make for some pretty cool holiday gifts. Govee’s backlighting kit released in 2020 is back on sale at Amazon. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $63.99 once you clip the $20 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the product’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsGMEZ"&gt;Govee is also selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $62.99&lt;/a&gt; as a part of its holiday sale, which is a little cheaper. Still, if you prefer to shop from Amazon or are a Prime member, the Amazon deal could be the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="plsQMm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zH8SZ"&gt;For those still trying to nab a PlayStation 5 — or for those lucky enough to already have one — one of our picks for the best SSDs compatible with the PS5 is currently at its best price ever. Normally $229.99, Amazon is selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s 980 Pro for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169.99&lt;/a&gt; instead. That’s a $60 discount on Samsung’s blazingly fast SSD, which is one of the few kinds of drives on the market that meet Sony’s performance requirements. It’s also compatible with PC, though you’ll only get its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds if you have a compatible motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyhOxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="NPAcho"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PlayStation 5 will be available for Walmart Plus members on Wednesday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821037/ps5-playstation-5-restock-available-walmart-plus-queue-deal-sale"},{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VzJPoI"&gt;Shifting away from SSDs to gaming controllers, Razer’s Kishi is a great gift for gamers on the go traveling this holiday season. You can clamp it onto your Android phone and easily transform it into a Nintendo Switch lookalike. It’s also compatible with many games available on a variety of cloud-based gaming platforms, including Google Stadia, Microsoft xCloud, and more. It’s typically a bit pricey at $79.99, but right now both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9PMTEDGaM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are taking nearly 50 percent off, selling it for $44.99 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wf8m22"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882522"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CH57MS"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals happening:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;If you’re an iPhone 12 Mini owner, Amazon is selling Apple’s black MagSafe leather case for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$23.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $59 — a 59 percent discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CUE8yB"&gt;Right now, PayPal is selling a $100 GameStop gift card for &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/gifts/brands/gamestopdecgood"&gt;$90&lt;/a&gt; that you can also use at ThinkGeek, EB Games, Babbage’s, and Planet X stores. It’s a good chance to save a little on a holiday gift or while treating yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OKgxx0"&gt;Amazon’s also offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/epicdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of deals&lt;/a&gt; on gift cards, like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vudu-Gift-Cards-Email-Delivery/dp/B09J7SKH8N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 Vudu card for $40&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VUDU&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o4qnWv"&gt;Costco members can get one of Microsoft’s latest Xbox wireless controllers in white &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-wireless-controller-robot-white.product.100735150.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $30&lt;/a&gt; (normally around $55).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="4VjdQW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gZN9Jk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep some of your Twitter data away from advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KO2UsiRk_sylLL1GCQvDsU23Fq0=/1x0:2040x1359/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455393/VRG_ILLO_4902_SECURE_TWITTER.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can’t keep Twitter out of your data completely, but you can lessen the damage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HDn6QQ"&gt;In April 2020, Twitter began sharing more of your information with advertisers. Notice came via a rather weird notification that said “your ability to control mobile app advertising measurements has been removed” — which basically meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213593/twitter-data-sharing-pop-up-mobile-app-advertising-settings"&gt;Twitter was now sharing data&lt;/a&gt; such as which ads you looked at or interacted with, as well as the tracking identifier for your phone. Previously, you could turn that off — no longer. (Unless you live in the European Union or the UK, where there are extra protections.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter removed some of its privacy protections back on April, 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeS_u0XJB0UY1SerbX0c2VJ_59g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659847/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.25.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter removed some of its privacy protections in April 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrg9J2"&gt;While that protection has been removed, there are still a few privacy tools available that can give you at least some measure of say over how much of your data is shared with advertisers. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth it to take a few minutes to find them and turn them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXpKGc"&gt;There is a single page on the web where you can find a lot of the settings, called the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account/personalization"&gt;Personalization and data&lt;/a&gt;” page. Unfortunately, that page no longer seems to be available on the mobile app. So while we’ll initially discuss the settings as found on the web page, I’ll also tell you how to get to each feature on mobile. (To get to any of the mobile settings, you’ll always start by tapping on your personal icon in the upper left corner.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZZUCLB02fnkc5Cg51cBnkbMINI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025630/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses advertisers have to your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qtz9zr"&gt;Disabling ad personalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lVRFAY"&gt;On the “Personalization and data” page, you’ll find several advertising settings that give Twitter permission to “further personalize” your advertising by using information based on your “inferred identity,” location, or other factors. (Go ahead and read all the descriptions — they’re worth knowing about.) You can choose to enable any of these settings if you wish, but otherwise, use the toggle at the top of the page to disable all of the settings on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNsoti"&gt;If you’re using the mobile app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bou6OE"&gt;Find “Personalized ads” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Ads preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zJi3kO"&gt;Find “Personalize based on your inferred identity” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ajPoAd"&gt;Find “Personalize based on places you’ve been” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NZfBbK"&gt;Find “Allow use of where you see Twitter content across the web” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9vXMOx"&gt;Find “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Data sharing with business partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M6gpp3"&gt;Find “Personalize based on precise location” (which is not available on the web settings) by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="O5scKT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dayz7F"&gt;See your Twitter data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzZHy"&gt;If you’d like to go a little further, and check the other data that Twitter knows about you (and possibly remove at least some of it), go down to the bottom of the “Personalization and data” page and click on “See your Twitter data.” Check all of these topics out; you may be surprised by some of the info that’s there. Here’s a short summary of each (along with directions if you’re using the mobile app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e6mcaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account. &lt;/strong&gt;This is all basic stuff, like your name, age range, whether you have a verified account, and what other languages you speak. (I was amused to find that Twitter thinks I speak German. Okay, Twitter, whatever.) In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Account information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hwclF3"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account history. &lt;/strong&gt;This contains two separate areas: a listing of other accounts that have access to your account, and a listing of places you have been. It’s a good idea to check the former to see if there are any services that have access to your account and shouldn’t; you can revoke permission on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"&gt;Connected apps&lt;/a&gt; page. If you don’t want Twitter to know where you are or where you’ve been, use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location_information"&gt;Location settings&lt;/a&gt; to turn off access. In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OzGMLr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apps, devices &amp;amp; information.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sections here. “Apps, devices &amp;amp; information” is where you might find some of the devices and browsers that Twitter gets info from — assuming you allow it to. This is what Twitter meant when it asked to “Personalize based on your inferred identity” on the “Personalization and data page,” and it is one of the permissions that can be revoked there. The second, “Connected apps,” is another way to access several of the pages already mentioned here. This info can also be found in your mobile app under: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyjvtP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account activity. &lt;/strong&gt;This&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lets you see what accounts you’ve blocked or muted. On your mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Mute and block.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Jnfnqh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interests and ad data. &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s a section you may spend a lot of time with, especially with “Interests from Twitter,” which tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity. If you plan on reviewing this thoroughly, put aside a few minutes: one of my Twitter accounts had 742 interests listed, including quite a few weird ones. As someone who has no interest in sports, I’d love to know how Twitter came up with “NBA videos” as an interest of mine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s8g5Hl"&gt;The other two categories here, “Inferred interests from partners” and “Tailored audiences,” can be disabled using the “Personalization and data” page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t find anything similar using the mobile app, but you can go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Content you see &amp;gt; Topics. There you’ll see some of the topics you’ve followed and that Twitter suggests you might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KeiiPf"&gt;Finally, “Download archive” lets you download the archive of your account history and activity. In your mobile app, go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Your account &amp;gt; Download an archive of your data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WcYWPm"&gt;Want to be really safe? You may want to just bite the bullet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete your Twitter history &lt;/a&gt;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
