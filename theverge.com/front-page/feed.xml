    <title>The Amiga is the latest game system to get a mini retro remake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4VcZtI2Y4xYKQwGFkc4pDJ0YNA=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69708448/a500.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6aYalQ"&gt;Commodore’s Amiga 500, a home computer that became a popular game system, is receiving a remake. The &lt;a href="https://retrogames.biz/thea500-mini"&gt;A500 Mini&lt;/a&gt; is being developed by Retro Games Ltd, which &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/23/17605438/c64-mini-thec64-mini-release-date-us"&gt;previously released&lt;/a&gt; a mini version of the Commodore 64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV2lOo"&gt;The Amiga 500 was the most successful model in the Amiga family of PCs, which started to appear in the mid-’80s and drew a devoted following as gaming systems, particularly in Europe. While the A500 Mini is clearly based on the Amiga 500, Retro Games Ltd says it’ll also emulate the more powerful AGA graphics hardware from the Amiga 1200. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EUoLG-pANmaGcjyGKRs07r8jApc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775518/a500.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K2hD5V"&gt;The list of games confirmed so far includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xb0vBy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Breed 3D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KFw8YE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P3YDVd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ATR: All Terrain Racing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E98kb7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battle Chess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VxIABu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cadaver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QVExxs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kick Off 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mpp2xY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinball Dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JLQro2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simon the Sorcerer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X5obsC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xFFpWi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chaos Engine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ywMl7P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worms: The Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gMgln4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OF29Er"&gt;There’ll be 25 included in total, and you’ll also be able to add more yourself with WHDLoad, an installation package for Amiga software. Other system functions include the ability to switch between 50Hz and 60Hz screen refresh rate, save states, a built-in CRT filter, and various scaling options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvkDvB"&gt;The A500 Mini comes with a two-button USB mouse that is already making my hand cramp up with nostalgia, as well as a gamepad reminiscent of the one from the CD32, an ill-fated attempt to convert the Amiga into a traditional game console. The keyboard on the case is sadly not functional, but you can hook up your own over USB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVhbCE"&gt;Retro Games Ltd will release the A500 Mini early next year. It’ll cost $139.99 in the US and £119.99 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now Microsoft is protesting after Amazon won a $10 billion NSA cloud contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-CRIME-INTELLIGENCE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2m5A3tRsQN8alFnCichIkPPBHpU=/53x0:3370x2211/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69708150/918218262.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oKWnGV"&gt;After spending years battling over the Defense Department’s $10 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565281/pentagon-microsoft-jedi-amazon"&gt;JEDI cloud services contract&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft and Amazon are fighting over another government deal. Now it’s the National Security Agency offering a contract that could pay up to $10 billion as it shifts away from on-premises servers to a commercial provider. However, as &lt;a href="https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/07/nsa-cloud-protest.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported first, this time around, Amazon Web Services won the $10 billion contest, and it’s Microsoft’s turn to &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/docket/b-420004.1"&gt;file a protest&lt;/a&gt; with the Government Accountability Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXYTO4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Technology &lt;/em&gt;reports that Microsoft’s claim is the NSA didn’t conduct a proper evaluation while considering a provider for its new project, code-named WildandStormy. In a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/08/nsa-awards-secret-10-billion-contract-amazon/184390/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NextGov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an NSA spokesperson confirmed the award and protests, saying, “The Agency will respond to the protest in accordance with appropriate federal regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="um5iKq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A decision is due by October 29th&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OPaZBi"&gt;The NSA is pursuing a “Hybrid Compute Initiative” to meet its processing and analytical requirements while also holding onto intelligence data (although it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965354/nsa-intelligence-no-warrant-phone-location-data-collection"&gt;might not need as much storage as it used to&lt;/a&gt;). AWS already holds many government cloud contracts, but the JEDI process revealed Microsoft as a formidable competitor. Last year the CIA split up its  Commercial Cloud Enterprise contract between five companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Oracle, and IBM. Last year, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fthe-broadest-range-of-cloud-innovation-across-us-government-data-classifications%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22618764%2Fnsa-10-billion-microsoft-aws-cloud-services-protest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Microsoft blog post&lt;/a&gt; said it was pursuing US government accreditation for its Azure Government Top Secret regions to “meet the demand for greater agility in the classified space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1g9FN"&gt;When Amazon was pushing for a review of the JEDI contract process, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20940040/amazon-jedi-pentagon-contract-microsoft-trump"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; “errors and unmistakable bias,” as former president Donald Trump reportedly stepped in, bringing his animosity toward then-CEO Jeff Bezos. Eventually, the DoD decided the program’s design no longer met its needs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565281/pentagon-microsoft-jedi-amazon"&gt;scrapped the entire plan&lt;/a&gt; to pursue a multi-vendor solution called &lt;a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/inside-dods-jedi-replacement-the-joint-warfighter-cloud-capability/"&gt;Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability&lt;/a&gt;. Will WildandStormy meet a similar fate? A step toward an answer will come within the next couple of months, as the GAO’s decision is due by October 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile has started offering fiber home internet in a limited pilot program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vT_c0K0JAGHHPLfi_RTmlJM-YWw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69707786/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company is exploring adding fiber as a complement to its fixed wireless home internet offering.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y5antk"&gt;T-Mobile has quietly started selling fiber-based home internet, &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/08/t-mobile-is-launching-fiber-optic-home-internet-starting-in-nyc/"&gt;as tipped to &lt;em&gt;T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by the company to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. T-Mobile says it’s testing fiber optic internet in certain residential buildings in Manhattan as a complement to its fixed wireless offering, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;made available to the public in April&lt;/a&gt;. The company isn’t deploying an entirely new fiber network for the pilot; it’s running on a local provider’s fiber lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hszq4y"&gt;Details on &lt;a href="https://t-mobilefiber.com"&gt;the dedicated T-Mobile Fiber site&lt;/a&gt; are thin, but it claims the service offers 940Mbps upload and download speeds. A Wi-Fi 6 router is included, along with chat and e-mail customer support for fiber customers. A T-Mobile rep had no other details to share with us, just that the program is a “very limited pilot” and more information would be shared “when and if” it becomes more widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qDOhdw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iLFnwk"&gt;T-Mobile has some ambitious plans for home internet. As the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;tried to convince regulators to let it buy Sprint&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, it argued that it would be able to offer competitive wireless home internet with the acquired spectrum. With the deal done, T-Mobile began a pilot program that included 100,000 households by the time it opened up to the general public. On a call with investors last week, the company said it was on track to meet its goal of 500,000 home internet customers by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34z6lX"&gt;It’s not clear how big of a role T-Mobile thinks fiber could play in its home internet plans, but it certainly seems to think it’s worth testing the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BitMEX crypto exchange agrees to pay $100 million to get financial regulators off its back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/arH6LMa_aPH8zLZlzGBExrgmdCs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69707718/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VPBJqN"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX has agreed to pay a $100 million civil penalty as part of a settlement with the &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8412-21"&gt;US Commodity Futures Trading Commission&lt;/a&gt; (CFTC) and the &lt;a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-100-million-enforcement-action-against-unregistered-futures"&gt;Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&lt;/a&gt; (FinCEN), &lt;a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/bitmex-confirms-it-has-reached-settlements-with-cftc-and-fincen/"&gt;the company announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The fine addresses charges that the derivatives exchange allowed illegal trades and violated anti-money laundering laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7D6E5g"&gt;BitMEX didn't address the less savory uses of its platform for years, as FinCEN says the company “willfully failed to comply with its obligations under the BSA (Bank Secrecy Act).”  According to the organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vb5GW2"&gt;For over six years, BitMEX failed to implement and maintain a compliant anti-money laundering program and a customer identification program, and it failed to report certain suspicious activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mV5gX0"&gt;FinCEN claims those issues exposed other financial entities to unnecessary risk due to the company’s unwillingness to collect more than an email address from traders from 2014 to 2020. Worse, BitMEX senior leadership deliberately altered customer information to hide customer’s true location, FinCEN claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDlstd"&gt;The probe into BitMEX started in 2020 with a charge from &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8270-20"&gt;the CFTC and the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; that BitMEX and its founders were running the exchange outside of the US and “unlawfully accepting orders and funds from U.S. customers to trade cryptocurrencies, including derivatives on bitcoin, ether, and litecoin,” the CFTC wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JgGedI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting investigated by the government is good, actually&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SFkPf"&gt;BitMEX’s announcement that it would pay didn’t confirm CFTC’s claims or FinCEN’s concerns over the BSA, nor did it address &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/bitmex-founders-and-executives-are-indicted-in-new-york?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;the criminal charges against BitMEX’s original three founders&lt;/a&gt;. Everything is apparently fine at BitMEX though, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/crypto-is-changing-and-bitmex-is-changing-with-it/"&gt;CEO Alexander Höptner&lt;/a&gt;. “Putting this legal matter with the CFTC and FinCEN behind us will only accelerate our evolution, and puts us firmly on the right path,” Höptner writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNE1Eh"&gt;As part of the settlement, the company will be forced to bring on an independent consultant to analyze its transactions and review its policies and procedures. It doesn’t seems like BitMEX has a choice but to be on the “right path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w5MMB"&gt;The resolution to BitMEX’s tussle with regulators is just the latest example of the US government’s growing focus on regulating cryptocurrencies. BitMEX’s “sin” of obscuring transactions is in the process of being addressed with even more permanent action. FinCEN &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;has proposed regulations&lt;/a&gt; for crypto wallets that would require identities to be tied to transactions of certain sizes, and members of the US Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608096/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-sec-gary-gensler-regulation"&gt;have called for even more power&lt;/a&gt; to regulate crypto trading. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford chip shortage means your Mustang Mach-E delivery may be at least six weeks late</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2WgcrJ5GNqLLaH9KlXhN8kGFI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69707251/sokane_210125_4386_1765.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wFktqI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford’s F-150 was hit&lt;/a&gt; by the global semiconductor shortage, and now its flagship Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle is seeing a serious delay too — by a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; of six weeks for prospective owners who were scheduled to get their vehicle between July 5th and October 1st. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/6-week-delay-email-going-out-soon-to-mach-e-order-holders-with-production-from-july-5-october-1.8520/"&gt;according to emails&lt;/a&gt; Ford sent to buyers today (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/10/ford-delays-mach-e-orders-by-6-weeks-due-to-chip-shortage-gives-250kwh-free-charging/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lh6OCG"&gt;It’s not the first delay for the Mustang Mach-E, either, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;after Ford held back some 4,500 cars in March&lt;/a&gt; for unspecified quality checks, and Ford’s handling this delay in much the same way, giving owners an additional 250kWh of free charging at stations in the company’s FordPass Charging Network. That’s on top of the 250kWh they were already going to receive for purchasing the vehicle. Since the Mach-E has a usable battery capacity of between 68kWh and 88kWh, we’re talking about roughly three free fill-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qobqd3"&gt;Some of the very first Mach-E vehicles also reportedly saw their deliveries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234668/ford-delays-deliveries-mustang-mach-e-quality-checks"&gt;pushed back by a month in January&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22513435/ford-mustang-mach-delivery-delay-uk-ecall"&gt;UK deliveries were paused&lt;/a&gt; due to a safety risk in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The JRR Token cryptocurrency is almost certainly headed for Mt. Doom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C1XmP1rRhSmqDSixthh50CQ_54E=/218x0:2555x1558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69707101/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_6.26.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish the token had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JRR Token&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="19hNBq"&gt;I hate to be the one to tell you this, but there’s a cryptocurrency themed after &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;. It’s dubbed the JRR Token, and its creators &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTokenOfPower/status/1416465935117033478?s=20"&gt;have called it &lt;/a&gt;“The One Token That Rules Them All.” Upon learning about it, my snap judgment was that it’ll be like &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit’s &lt;/em&gt;trilogy of films (pointless and doomed to fail), but that may be unfair. Let’s take a look at the video its creators made to explain what makes it special:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0BPWlM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pIOTLR0HD8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mrS7VN"&gt;Okay, wait. Before we even go into the crypto stuff, I’m wondering what the legal situation is with this video — the video includes images of rolling green countryside overlaid by very &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-esque text, while what sounds like a piano rendition of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlmiRndxkU8"&gt;Howard Shore’s &lt;em&gt;The Shire&lt;/em&gt; plays&lt;/a&gt;. Even if those don’t turn out to be infringement, they’re definitely banking on confusion with JRR Tolkien’s name. That &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien_Estate#Legal_issues"&gt;doesn’t seem like the kind of thing the Tolkien Estate&lt;/a&gt; would let slide without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgZ3aQ"&gt;Let’s put all that aside for now. What’s JRR Token all about? The website and video say that “Tokenites,” or anyone with tokens, will get more of those tokens as more people use the network. It also says that a portion of every transaction will be added to a “liquidity pool,” which I’m sorry to say doesn’t have anything to do with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3VOf3CBGvw"&gt;that terrifying scene of Galadriel showing Frodo the Scouring of the Shire&lt;/a&gt;.  If you’re wondering how its “Tokenomics” work out to making it a functional currency, I am too — but reading the token’s whitepaper, and through some of the FAQ for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434965/binance-investigation-irs-justice-cryptocurrency"&gt;the Binance platform&lt;/a&gt; (which JRR Token is built on) didn’t clear things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pSWZCY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I may have misunderstood the movies and books, but the Ring didn’t seem like a force for good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R4v28A"&gt;The website does, however, go into detail on how to obtain the tokens. To someone who’s not exceedingly familiar with crypto, but knows how more popular coins work, the process seems akin to answering and asking riddles in the dark. It involves sending payment to a contract address — which sounds even sketchier than if it were done through, say, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17151430/bankruptcy-mt-gox-liabilities-bitcoin"&gt;Mt. Gox&lt;/a&gt; clone called Mt. Doom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAzkjK"&gt;Maybe I could overlook all that if the creators of JRR Token had paid an actor who appeared in the&lt;em&gt; Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; films to promote the cryptocurrency. Perhaps if Billy Boyd, the actor who played Pippin, were to make a Cameo, I’d be sold! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fvCCV"&gt;Well, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/did-pippin-from-the-lord-of-rings-just-promote-a-new-cr-1847434477"&gt;that was a thing that actually happened&lt;/a&gt;. And while JRR Token’s tweet containing that video endorsement has since been deleted, the people behind the JRR Token &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTokenOfPower/status/1422924376089956356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1422924376089956356%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;have since tweeted&lt;/a&gt; something nearly as incredible (shout out to &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2021/08/08/new-crypto-currency-jrr-token-wants-to-be-the-one-coin-to-rule-them-all.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/em&gt; for the find&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vS277s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Saruman was trying to unify Middle Earth under centralized rule where as the fellowship wanted decentralization. Cryptocurrency is literally a decentralized network….&lt;/p&gt;— JRR Token (@TheTokenOfPower) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTokenOfPower/status/1422924376089956356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uLaiUp"&gt;The project is now public, so you can see &lt;a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/pancakeswap/pair-explorer/0xf2e2e720fa9930b26cd38228eb352d748922aa53"&gt;trading charts&lt;/a&gt; of it and everything. At this point, though, it’s unclear if the token is just a troll (the internet kind, not &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyevhryWKHk"&gt;the cave kind&lt;/a&gt;), or if it’s serious. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/10/is-the-jrr-token-a-real-cryptocurrency-or-a-joke-either-way-im-not-buying-it"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; columnist Arwa Mahdawi points out&lt;/a&gt;, it can be hard to tell with nascent cryptocurrencies. We reached out to crypto expert and UVA assistant professor Lana Swartz to get her read on whether The Token of Power and its stated goals make sense, and she also says that it’s tough to say these days, especially after the rise of Dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wniLZE"&gt;Well, whether its creators are earnest or not, am I rushing to buy JRR Token, hoping to get in on the ground floor? No, absolutely not (and not just because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ethics-statement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s ethics policy&lt;/a&gt; forbids it.)  After many days and nights of deep &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; research, I’ve come away with the impression that the One Ring was not actually a force for good. Specifically, if I were &lt;a href="http://www.jrrtoken.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/JRR-Whitepaper-2.pdf"&gt;writing a whitepaper about my cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;, I wouldn’t use &lt;a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ring_Verse"&gt;the text engraved on the Ring&lt;/a&gt; to describe said cryptocurrency — and I certainly wouldn't compare my coin’s market to the Ring’s power to bind the other rings to Sauron’s will, resulting in humans becoming Ringwraiths. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhIRBfJTtfD1v5hGoL_hJiU0UbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759455/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_1.45.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is genuinely the first part of the whitepaper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxZvrW0rpUQ9VAnQVwCTqnsA-zM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69706816/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qvb3Xg"&gt;Apple stakes its reputation on privacy. The company has promoted encrypted messaging across its ecosystem, encouraged limits on how mobile apps can gather data, and fought law enforcement agencies looking for user records. For the past week, though, Apple has been fighting accusations that its upcoming iOS and iPadOS release will weaken user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVWpBi"&gt;The debate stems from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;announcement Apple made&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. In theory, the idea is pretty simple: Apple wants to fight child sexual abuse, and it’s taking more steps to find and stop it. But critics say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;Apple’s strategy could weaken&lt;/a&gt; users’ control over their own phones, leaving them reliant on Apple’s promise that it won’t abuse its power. And Apple’s response has highlighted just how complicated — and sometimes downright confounding — the conversation really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oxykkz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did Apple announce last week?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dc6dr1"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22613225%2Fapple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced three changes&lt;/a&gt; that will roll out later this year — all related to curbing child sexual abuse but targeting different apps with different feature sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztjL4D"&gt;The first change affects Apple’s Search app and Siri. If a user searches for topics related to child sexual abuse, Apple will direct them to resources for reporting it or getting help with an attraction to it. That’s rolling out later this year on iOS 15, watchOS 8, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, and it’s largely uncontroversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhX8SA"&gt;The other updates, however, have generated far more backlash. One of them adds a parental control option to Messages, obscuring sexually explicit pictures for users under 18 and sending parents an alert if a child 12 or under views or sends these pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZwidK"&gt;The final new feature scans iCloud Photos images to find child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, and reports it to Apple moderators — who can pass it on to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC. Apple says it’s designed this feature specifically to protect user privacy while finding illegal content. Critics say that same designs amounts to a security backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XeULNq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Apple doing with Messages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YemRv3"&gt;Apple is introducing a Messages feature that’s meant to protect children from inappropriate images. If parents opt in, devices with users under 18 will scan incoming and outgoing pictures with an image classifier trained on pornography, looking for “sexually explicit” content. (Apple says it’s not technically limited to nudity but that a nudity filter is a fair description.) If the classifier detects this content, it obscures the picture in question and asks the user whether they really want to view or send it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Apple’s Messages filter for sexually explicit content." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcBS2sGWzUDR2RWMe6AIhKN4IWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774655/CCEA6371_9191_46CC_BDE4_B2DAB4CC4409.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of Apple’s Messages filter for sexually explicit content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n4evJQ"&gt;The update — coming to accounts set up as families in iCloud on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey — also includes an additional option. If a user taps through that warning and they’re under 13, Messages will be able to notify a parent that they’ve done it. Children will see a caption warning that their parents will receive the notification, and the parents won’t see the actual message. The system doesn’t report anything to Apple moderators or other parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9Rr8f"&gt;The images are detected on-device, which Apple says protects privacy. And parents are notified if children actually confirm they want to see or send adult content, not if they simply receive it. At the same time, critics like Harvard Cyberlaw Clinic instructor Kendra Albert have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423365222841135114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1423367106972852228%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F6%2F22613365%2Fapple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the notifications — saying they could end up outing queer or transgender kids, for instance, by encouraging their parents to snoop on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="04Xy16"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Apple’s new iCloud Photos scanning system do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OfIeOI"&gt;The iCloud Photos scanning system is focused on finding child sexual abuse images, which are illegal to possess. If you’re a US-based iOS or iPadOS user and you sync pictures with iCloud Photos, your device will locally check these pictures against a list of known CSAM. If it detects enough matches, it will alert Apple’s moderators and reveal the details of the matches. If a moderator confirms the presence of CSAM, they’ll disable the account and report the images to legal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mmwusD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is CSAM scanning a new idea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Qo0T8L"&gt;Not at all. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and many other companies scan users’ files against hash libraries, often using a Microsoft-built tool called PhotoDNA. They’re also legally required to report CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a nonprofit that works alongside law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZjID1"&gt;Apple has limited its efforts until now, though. The company has said previously that it uses image matching technology to find child exploitation. But in a call with reporters, it said it’s never scanned iCloud Photos data. (It confirmed that it already scanned iCloud Mail but didn’t offer any more detail about scanning other Apple services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AaZIXm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Apple’s new system different from other companies’ scans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OOjY2L"&gt;A typical CSAM scan runs remotely and looks at files that are stored on a server. Apple’s system, by contrast, checks for matches locally on your iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuJuhx"&gt;The system works as follows. When iCloud Photos is enabled on a device, the device uses a tool called NeuralHash to break these pictures into hashes — basically strings of numbers that identify the unique characteristics of an image but can’t be reconstructed to reveal the image itself. Then, it compares these hashes against a stored list of hashes from NCMEC, which compiles millions of hashes corresponding to known CSAM content. (Again, as mentioned above, there are no actual pictures or videos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8ucZY"&gt;If Apple’s system finds a match, your phone generates a “safety voucher” that’s uploaded to iCloud Photos. Each safety voucher indicates that a match exists, but it doesn’t alert any moderators and it encrypts the details, so an Apple employee can’t look at it and see which photo matched. However, if your account generates a certain number of vouchers, the vouchers all get decrypted and flagged to Apple’s human moderators — who can then review the photos and see if they contain CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b52TDh"&gt;Apple emphasizes that it’s exclusively looking at photos you sync with iCloud, not ones that are only stored on your device. It tells reporters that disabling iCloud Photos will completely deactivate all parts of the scanning system, including the local hash generation. “If users are not using iCloud Photos, NeuralHash will not run and will not generate any vouchers,” Apple privacy head Erik Neuenschwander &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; in an interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJqada"&gt;Apple has used on-device processing to bolster its privacy credentials in the past. iOS can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924080/apple-ai-on-device-privacy-wwdc-2016"&gt;perform a lot of AI analysis&lt;/a&gt; without sending any of your data to cloud servers, for example, which means fewer chances for a third party to get their hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wSx4y"&gt;But the local / remote distinction here is hugely contentious, and following a backlash, Apple has spent the past several days drawing extremely subtle lines between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rKzkRU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are some people upset about these changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cAxm1C"&gt;Before we get into the criticism, it’s worth saying: Apple has gotten praise for these updates from some privacy and security experts, including the prominent cryptographers and computer scientists Mihir Bellare, David Forsyth, and Dan Boneh. “This system will likely significantly increase the likelihood that people who own or traffic in [CSAM] are found,” said Forsyth in an endorsement provided by Apple. “Harmless users should experience minimal to no loss of privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6nWSV"&gt;But other experts and advocacy groups have come out against the changes. They say the iCloud and Messages updates have the same problem: they’re creating surveillance systems that work directly from your phone or tablet. That could provide a blueprint for breaking secure end-to-end encryption, and even if its use is limited right now, it could open the door to more troubling invasions of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kF34kp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://appleprivacyletter.com/"&gt;An August 6th open letter&lt;/a&gt; outlines the complaints in more detail. Here’s its description of what’s going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b50GTi"&gt;While child exploitation is a serious problem, and while efforts to combat it are almost unquestionably well-intentioned, Apple’s proposal introduces a backdoor that threatens to undermine fundamental privacy protections for all users of Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GC2dGn"&gt;Apple’s proposed technology works by continuously monitoring photos saved or shared on the user’s iPhone, iPad, or Mac. One system detects if a certain number of objectionable photos is detected in iCloud storage and alerts the authorities. Another notifies a child’s parents if iMessage is used to send or receive photos that a machine learning algorithm considers to contain nudity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drY3RR"&gt;Because both checks are performed on the user’s device, they have the potential to bypass any end-to-end encryption that would otherwise safeguard the user’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wR3KIb"&gt;Apple has disputed the characterizations above, particularly the term “backdoor” and the description of monitoring photos saved on a user’s device. But as we’ll explain below, it’s asking users to put a lot of trust in Apple, while the company is facing government pressure around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7F22ax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s end-to-end encryption, again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Su1Rpy"&gt;To massively simplify, end-to-end encryption (or E2EE) makes data unreadable to anyone besides the sender and receiver; in other words, not even the company running the app can see it. Less secure systems can still be encrypted, but companies may hold keys to the data so they can scan files or grant access to law enforcement. Apple’s iMessages uses E2EE; iCloud Photos, like many cloud storage services, doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esnJuH"&gt;While E2EE can be incredibly effective, it doesn’t necessarily stop people from seeing data on the phone itself. That leaves the door open for specific kinds of surveillance, including a system that Apple is now accused of adding: client-side scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YEyzOe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is client-side scanning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8jPj5E"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"&gt;has a detailed outline&lt;/a&gt; of client-side scanning. Basically, it involves analyzing files or messages in an app before they’re sent in encrypted form, often checking for objectionable content — and in the process, bypassing the protections of E2EE by targeting the device itself. In a phone call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, EFF senior staff technologist Erica Portnoy compared these systems to somebody looking over your shoulder while you’re sending a secure message on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PQK32h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Apple doing client-side scanning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5x75cC"&gt;Apple vehemently denies it. In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2Fpdf%2FExpanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22613225%2Fapple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a frequently asked questions document&lt;/a&gt;, it says Messages is still end-to-end encrypted and absolutely no details about specific message content are being released to anybody, including parents. “Apple never gains access to communications as a result of this feature in Messages,” it promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cks3Ug"&gt;It also rejects the framing that it’s scanning photos &lt;em&gt;on your device &lt;/em&gt;for CSAM. “By design, this feature only applies to photos that the user chooses to upload to iCloud,” its FAQ says. “The system does not work for users who have iCloud Photos disabled. This feature does not work on your private iPhone photo library on the device.” The company later clarified to reporters that Apple could scan iCloud Photos images synced via third-party services as well as its own apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QKiFs"&gt;As Apple acknowledges, iCloud Photos doesn’t even have any E2EE to break, so it could easily run these scans on its servers — just like lots of other companies. Apple argues its system is actually more secure. Most users are unlikely to to have CSAM on their phone, and Apple claims only around 1 in 1 trillion accounts could be incorrectly flagged. With this local scanning system, Apple says it won’t expose any information about anybody else’s photos, which wouldn’t be true if it scanned its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L7G048"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Apple’s arguments convincing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0BGcyZ"&gt;Not to a lot of its critics. As Ben Thompson &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/apples-mistake/"&gt;writes at &lt;em&gt;Stratechery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the issue isn’t whether Apple is only sending notifications to parents or restricting its searches to specific categories of content. It’s that the company is searching through data before it leaves your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rdr527"&gt;Instead of adding CSAM scanning to iCloud Photos in the cloud that they own and operate, Apple is compromising the phone that you and I own and operate, without any of us having a say in the matter. Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning, but that is a policy decision; the capability to reach into a user’s phone now exists, and there is nothing an iPhone user can do to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7FEaCM"&gt;CSAM is illegal and abhorrent. But as the open letter to Apple notes, many countries have pushed to compromise encryption in the name of fighting terrorism, misinformation, and other objectionable content. Now that Apple has set this precedent, it will almost certainly face calls to expand it. And if Apple later rolls out end-to-end encryption for iCloud — something it’s reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive/exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT"&gt;considered doing, albeit never implemented&lt;/a&gt; — it’s laid out a possible roadmap for getting around E2EE’s protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH0qDp"&gt;Apple says it will refuse any calls to abuse its systems. And it boasts a lot of safeguards: the fact that parents can’t enable alerts for older teens in Messages, that iCloud’s safety vouchers are encrypted, that it sets a threshold for alerting moderators, and that its searches are US-only and strictly limited to NCMEC’s database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="j65XiD"&gt;Apple’s CSAM detection capability is built solely to detect known CSAM images stored in iCloud Photos that have been identified by experts at NCMEC and other child safety groups. We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future. Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aOwkc0"&gt;The issue is, Apple has the power to modify these safeguards. “Half the problem is that the system is so easy to change,” says Portnoy. Apple has stuck to its guns in some clashes with governments; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;famously defied&lt;/a&gt; a Federal Bureau of Investigation demand for data from a mass shooter’s iPhone. But it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;acceded to other requests&lt;/a&gt; like storing Chinese iCloud data locally, even if it insists it hasn’t compromised user security by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AmFSw"&gt;Stanford Internet Observatory professor Alex Stamos &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1424054555394727939"&gt;also questioned&lt;/a&gt; how well Apple had worked with the larger encryption expert community, saying that the company had declined to participate in a series of discussions about safety, privacy, and encryption. “With this announcement they just busted into the balancing debate and pushed everybody into the furthest corners with no public consultation or debate,” he tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AqTnwc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do the benefits of Apple’s new features stack up against the risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EAtRi1"&gt;As usual, it’s complicated — and it depends partly on whether you see this change as a limited exception or an opening door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jEzpt"&gt;Apple has legitimate reasons to step up its child protection efforts. In late 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published reports&lt;/a&gt; of an “epidemic” in online child sexual abuse. It blasted American tech companies for failing to address the spread of CSAM, and in a later article, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/online-child-sexual-abuse.html"&gt;NCMEC singled out Apple&lt;/a&gt; for its low reporting rates compared to peers like Facebook, something the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; attributed partly to the company not scanning iCloud files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo9lbl"&gt;Meanwhile, internal Apple documents have said that iMessage has a sexual predator problem. In documents revealed by the recent &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, an Apple department head listed “child predator grooming” as an under-resourced “active threat” for the platform. Grooming often includes sending children (or asking children to send) sexually explicit images, which is exactly what Apple’s new Messages feature is trying to disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KQCtc"&gt;At the same time, Apple itself has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172718/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-facebook-cambridge-analytica"&gt;called privacy&lt;/a&gt; a “human right.” Phones are intimate devices full of sensitive information. With its Messages and iCloud changes, Apple has demonstrated two ways to search or analyze content directly on the hardware rather than after you’ve sent data to a third party, even if it’s analyzing data that you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; consented to send, like iCloud photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWs0I6"&gt;Apple has acknowledged the objections to its updates. But so far, it hasn’t indicated plans to modify or abandon them. On Friday, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/apple-internal-memo-icloud-photo-scanning-concerns/"&gt;an internal memo&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged “misunderstandings” but praised the changes. “What we announced today is the product of this incredible collaboration, one that delivers tools to protect children, but also maintain Apple’s deep commitment to user privacy,” it reads. “We know some people have misunderstandings, and more than a few are worried about the implications, but we will continue to explain and detail the features so people understand what we’ve built.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Dating is getting audio chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E1DHNILAB9UfVqWJIMJ4JeAJEig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69706794/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VlTyIW"&gt;Facebook Dating, the company’s dating service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22384448/facebook-dating-user-data-popular-downloads"&gt;doesn’t appear to be as popular as other dating apps&lt;/a&gt;, but the company is introducing some new features to make it more useful for virtual dating, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;which has boomed during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2G95ZB"&gt;One of the biggest new features is audio dates, which will let you start an audio conversation with somebody you match with. When you try to start a call with someone, the other person will receive an invitation. If they accept, you both can have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQTGWo"&gt;Facebook is also allowing you to set up to two additional places in Facebook Dating where you want to look for matches. The feature, which Facebook calls Match Anywhere, should make it easier to match up with people who may be temporarily working or living in different places or frequently traveling between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yb1hI1"&gt;The company is also launching a feature called Lucky Pick, which “enables daters to consider other compatible candidates who may be outside their typical preferences,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexvoica/status/1425082273523720192"&gt;according to Facebook communications staffer Alexandru Voica&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xceDwI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lucky Pick: We’ve heard from people that the preferences they set aren’t always hard and fast, and to cut down on “the one that got away,” Facebook Dating’s new Lucky Pick feature enables daters to consider other compatible candidates who may be outside their typical preferences.&lt;/p&gt;— Alexandru Voica   (@alexvoica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexvoica/status/1425082273523720192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgCvvC"&gt;Facebook Dating isn’t the company’s only dating app — in April, Facebook’s NPE Team, which builds experimental apps, released an app called Sparked that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381511/facebook-video-speed-dating-npe-team-sparked-feature"&gt;sets you up on four-minute video speed dates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC and Warner Bros. have agreed to make movies exclusive to theaters for 45 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AMC movie theater logo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ObNGh-QXKC22VwuAcm7mwGrmGj4=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69706309/amc-movie-theater-logo_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZOpzd1"&gt;AMC and Warner Bros. have struck a deal to have the studio’s movies stay exclusive to theaters for 45 days, instead of being immediately available digitally (&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/warner-bros-commits-to-exclusive-theatrical-release-in-2022-in-new-amc-theatre-deal-1234995035/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The news was announced by AMC CEO Adam Aron &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F08%2F10%2Famc-entertainment-holdings-amc-q2-2021-earnings-ca%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22618697%2Famc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during an earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, and it means that Warner Bros. won't be making its 2022 movies, which include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2224162/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, available at home (or on HBO Max) until just over six weeks after they’re released in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Am4yJf"&gt;Warner Bros. already had a similar deal in place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;with Regal Cinemas’ owners&lt;/a&gt;, but today’s news truly seems to herald the end of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;the streaming experiment&lt;/a&gt; the studio was trying out in 2021. While HBO Max may not be getting movies the same day as theaters anymore, things aren’t exactly going back to the way they were pre-pandemic: theaters used to lay exclusive claim to movies for &lt;a href="https://www.screendaily.com/features/-is-45-days-the-new-length-of-the-us-theatrical-window/5158355.article"&gt;between 75 and 90 days&lt;/a&gt;, which is much longer than the deals being struck now. Streaming is also clearly still a focus for Warner Bros. AMC said on the call that “all Warner Bros. films” in 2022 would have the exclusivity window, but WarnerMedia’s CEO has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;HBO Max would be getting 10 exclusive films&lt;/a&gt; next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="osiq8E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Theaters used to lay exclusive claim to movies for anywhere between 75 and 90 days&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pD5Jiu"&gt;Warner Bros. isn’t the only studio negotiating to bring back theater exclusives. AMC and Universal have worked out a deal as well, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;allows for as little as a 17-day exclusivity window&lt;/a&gt;, and Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;along with Paramount&lt;/a&gt;, will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;doing a 45-day window, too&lt;/a&gt;. Most of those studios have their own respective streaming services to look after and sell, but theaters still seem to be important to the movie business. During the call, AMC said it has an “active dialogue with every major studio” about theater exclusivity windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qbrhZ5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMC “was not at all happy” with Warner Bros.’ HBO Max push&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CPDquo"&gt;Aron &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F08%2F10%2Famc-entertainment-holdings-amc-q2-2021-earnings-ca%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22618697%2Famc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said on the call&lt;/a&gt; that the theater chain “was not at all happy” when Warner Bros.’ plan was to have its streaming and theater releases happen on the same day. The theater chain wasn’t alone in its angst. Directors like Denis Villeneuve (&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;) and Christopher Nolan (&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;all but declared same-day streaming to be the end of cinema&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYFu5K"&gt;Actors, whose pay can be tied to box office performance, were also unhappy about day-and-date streaming releases, with Scarlett Johansson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;suing Disney&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s release. With actors, filmmakers, and theaters going against them, it’s not hard to see why studios are considering going back to the old way of releasing movies (if with shorter windows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyKjyA"&gt;Also mentioned in the earnings call was a spate of new theaters and acquisitions — AMC says it’ll be opening about a dozen new theaters across the globe, as well as acquiring a handful of unspecified theaters from the Arclight / Pacific chain, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22381031/arclight-cinema-pacific-theaters-permanent-closure-movies"&gt;announced that it wouldn’t be reopening after COVID&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Good news if you want to see a movie as soon as it's publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 casts Idris Elba as Knuckles</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BUHDJm"&gt;Knuckles the Echidna is set to make his live-action debut in &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2 &lt;/em&gt;next year — and now we know who’ll be voicing him: none other than &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/idriselba/status/1425174698007138305"&gt;Idris Elba&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Cats &lt;/em&gt;and also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;other movies, apparently). Elba appears to have not &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; been completely scared away from showing up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18527476/sonic-live-action-cgi-redesign-sega-paramount-director-fan-edits"&gt;hybrid live-action / animated films&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21034843/cats-film-updated-digital-fur-technology"&gt;sometimes-questionable CGI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQv1qt"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22446215/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-synopsis-copyright-listing"&gt;leaked synopsis for the film&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt; will actually see Elba’s animated echidna team up with Jim Carrey’s Dr. Robotnik “in search for an emerald that has the power to both build and destroy civilizations.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="huO3EO"&gt;Elba will join Ben Schwartz, who voiced Sonic in the first film, and returning live-action actors James Marsden as Tom and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt; will also feature Miles “Tails” Prower (who appeared in a post-credit scene in the first film), but it’s unclear if the flying fox character will be voiced by Colleen O’Shaughnessey — who also has voiced Tails in other &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt; games and media — or if he’ll be recast with an actor with more name recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOVhh2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on April 8th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
