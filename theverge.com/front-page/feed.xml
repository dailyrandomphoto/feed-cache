    <title>Missouri governor threatens reporter who discovered state site spilling private info</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0tzqrf"&gt;Missouri Governor Mike Parson &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/missouri-governor-vows-to-prosecute-st-louis-post-dispatch-for-reporting-security-vulnerability/"&gt;is threatening legal action&lt;/a&gt; against a reporter and newspaper that found and responsibly disclosed a security vulnerability that left teacher and educational staffs’ social security numbers exposed and easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ha8eD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agencys-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that it notified the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) that one of its tools was returning HTML pages that contained employee SSNs, potentially putting the information of over 100,000 employees at risk. Despite the fact that the outlet waited until the tool was taken down by the state to publish its story, the reporter has been called a “hacker” by Governor Parson, who says he’ll be getting the county prosecutor and investigators involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw6LQK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/parson-issues-legal-threat-against-post-dispatch-after-database-flaws-exposed/article_93f4d7d6-f792-5b1b-b556-00b5cac23af3.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the tool that contained the vulnerability was designed to let the public see teachers’ credentials. However, it reportedly also included the employee’s SSN in the page it returned — while it apparently didn’t appear as visible text on the screen, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/missouri-governor-vows-to-prosecute-st-louis-post-dispatch-for-reporting-security-vulnerability/#comments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that accessing it would be as easy as right-clicking on the page and clicking Inspect Element or View Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tpUPCc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seeing employee’s SSNs was reportedly as easy as clicking View Source&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LLmsXm"&gt;While the reporter followed standard protocols for disclosing and reporting on the vulnerability, the governor is treating him as if he attacked the site or was trying to access the teacher’s private information for nefarious purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmLkW1"&gt;In a press conference, Governor Parson described the reporter’s actions as “decoding the HTML source code,” which makes it seem suspicious and clandestine. He is, however, literally describing how viewing a website works — it’s the server’s job to send an HMTL file to your computer so you can view it, and anything included in that file isn’t secret (even if it’s not physically visible on your screen when viewing that webpage). Governor Parson says that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GovParsonMO/status/1448697775068229635?s=20"&gt;nothing on DESE’s website gave users permission&lt;/a&gt; to access the SSN data, but it was being freely provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERj8T9"&gt;You can view the governor’s full press conference below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R0s8gG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NxJjLWa9R2g?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=427&amp;amp;start=427" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ieirjt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Missouri DESE to clarify whether the tool was publicly accessible or required logging in but did not immediately receive a response. Of course, it being accessible at all is an issue, regardless of whether it was behind a login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xdisiL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The governor’s response flies in the face of standard practice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aAxDjO"&gt;Missouri’s response is, to put it lightly, the exact opposite of standard practice. Many organizations have bug or security bounties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031350/apple-bug-bounty-rewards-open-program-macos-icloud-ios"&gt;worth hundreds of thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;, which they’ll pay to hackers who find and responsibly disclose flaws like these. The reason these exist is that they’ll make your systems safer — yes, people will look for and find vulnerabilities, but there was likely already somebody doing that anyways. With a bug bounty, they’re telling you so you can fix it rather than selling that info on the dark web or using it for personal gain. Obviously, those kinds of sums aren’t reasonable for school districts, which often have underfunded IT departments due to shrinking budgets, but there’re a lot of options between paying out large sums of money and threatening legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X05RIj"&gt;Governor Parson says that the incident could cost the state’s taxpayers $50 million. If a malicious hacker had found the treasure trove of SSNs, it likely would’ve been even more expensive: the state still would’ve had to fix the system, and it’d have teachers who would have solid claims against it if they needed identity protection services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hKQPF1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You still have to patch vulnerabilities even if you’re not publicly called out for them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yLlrub"&gt;Governor Parson (along with &lt;a href="https://oa.mo.gov/commissioners-office/news/state-missouri-addresses-data-vulnerability"&gt;a press release by the Office of Administration&lt;/a&gt;) clarifies that the SSNs were only accessible one at a time — a list of all employees’ private info wasn’t included in the HTML files. But as anyone who’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KdtPNRzuKrk?t=119"&gt;watched the opening scene of &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; knows, it can be trivial for hackers to download all the pages from an application and strip specific pieces of information out of them. Just because the reporter didn’t do it (it would’ve arguably been irresponsible if he had) doesn’t mean that it wasn’t possible and doesn’t speak to good security practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KLiNup"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prosecuting this disclosure will put people in Missouri at risk&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mBP2OQ"&gt;To be clear: prosecuting the reporter, news outlet, and anyone involved will only serve to put people in Missouri at risk because no one will want to report security flaws they’ve found in public systems if the state’s response will be sending law enforcement after them. Security flaws like this are extremely unfortunate, but they will inevitably happen (the &lt;em&gt;Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; reports that the DESE was found to have been storing student SSNs by an audit in 2015). With public entities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;and companies alike&lt;/a&gt;, the real test isn’t whether it happens but how you respond to it. Unfortunately, it seems like Governor Parson is failing that test.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IndiEV reveals electric car with a built-in gaming PC but not much else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0rCy1P2xWOxn5E_lfo9k4yWpB0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996587/EV3A4269.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nm04mj"&gt;There’s a new electric vehicle startup breaking cover in California, making bold claims and teasing pie-in-the-sky ideas while remaining guarded about its founder and origin story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afXIPa"&gt;If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s a story that’s been playing out on repeat the last half-decade. This time, it’s a company called IndiEV, which emerged from stealth mode Thursday with a small prototype electric car called the Indi One that it says will start at just $45,000 — a car it boldly says will launch at the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM56Pb"&gt;Parts of the script are the same: IndiEV wants to power the Indi One with a scalable lithium-ion battery pack (that can be adapted to fit more affordable or expensive models or future vehicles); It wants to take advantage of the extra room afforded by the simpler architecture of electric vehicles to do interesting things in the cabin; it blends a futuristic exterior with a somewhat minimalist interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8oKdAV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some funny ideas and a bold design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f90KB7"&gt;But IndiEV diverges from that script in a few places, most notably in that it’s promising the top tier Indi One will be the “first vehicle to have an integrated supercomputer” onboard, which it says will power all sorts of gaming and entertainment applications inside the car — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;like what Tesla is doing with the new Model S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtCVZ3"&gt;When pushed on the details, IndiEV shared that this “supercomputer” is merely a custom Windows PC with an i7 processor and an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card. That’s not even top-of-the-line hardware, let alone a package that could in any seriousness be called a “supercomputer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="unS1FI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10807882"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjbQxG"&gt;One of IndiEV’s marketing reps said during a Zoom briefing that the hope is that the dedicated rig can power “any triple-A game, any virtual reality game, any augmented reality game.” The company showed off what they said was a working, hand-built prototype of the vehicle that had two 15-inch touchscreens on the dash — one for the separate Linux-based vehicle information system and one for the PC under the hood — and illustrations of people using VR headsets in the back seat while being driven around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRhpAX"&gt;The company’s reps talked about other funny uses, too, like filming drives with the interior and exterior cameras and then editing the footage and uploading it over — you guessed it — the car’s built-in 5G modem. At the very least, IndiEV’s claimed team of about 65 people has created an interesting engineering challenge for themselves, as the “supercomputer” is mounted under the car’s front hood. It’s packaged in a cooler-sized housing that will have to somehow withstand the radical temperature shifts and vibrations that come with driving a car — no easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="px47KG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yep, it’s got 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYSaKW"&gt;Not only did IndiEV claim the car I saw during the briefing was a working prototype, but it says a supplier in South Korea has already built 12 prototype bodies-in-white (the steel structure that sits on top of the chassis) for the Indi One. IndiEV didn’t name any of its suppliers, though data from ImportYeti shows that it had at least one body-in-white delivered to the US from a South Korean company called Merit Inc., an electric motor delivered from China’s &lt;a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/09/20210922-allison.html"&gt;Jing-Jin Electric&lt;/a&gt;, and battery cells from Chinese supplier Eve Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXKtTl"&gt;What, exactly, has been funding all these efforts for the last four years? IndiEV’s head of operations, John Kennedy, declined to say. But the startup was founded by a Chinese mobile game entrepreneur named Shi Hai, court documents and state filings show, who started a company called Snail Games a little more than a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4lRHF"&gt;There may be a reason why he’s not front and center: Shi and his ventures have been sued three times over claims of racist behavior, poor treatment of employees, and in one case, wrongful termination and wage theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXZPba"&gt;In 2014, one of the top executives at Snail Games’ US division David Runyan &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-11-14-former-snail-games-usa-exec-alleges-racism-and-unfair-dismissal"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the company and Shi, claiming the founder discriminated against non-Chinese employees and made derogatory statements. He also said in his complaint that “working for Shi Hai was extraordinarily difficult as he was a volatile individual who would often make decisions based on raw emotions and snap judgments.” The suit was ultimately settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MG2OSi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;IndiEV didn’t want to talk about how it was funded&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDxFA1"&gt;In 2019, IndiEV’s then-head of supply chain Shawn VanAmburg &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927695/1763263201_1_25_.pdf"&gt;sued the company&lt;/a&gt;, Shi, and a number of other founding executives over similar claims. In one alleged interaction, Shi told VanAmburg to fire her male subordinates and hire Chinese women because “Chinese Women like to shop and are better negotiators,” according to the complaint. VanAmburg also alleged a number of safety code violations at IndiEV’s Los Angeles, CA facility. Her case wound up in arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IcLQN"&gt;Also in 2019, a woman named Meng Hua Lee &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927687/1780335640_1_41_.pdf"&gt;sued Snail Games&lt;/a&gt;, Shi, and other executives. She stated in her complaint that she worked as a “gopher” for Shi and his wife, Ying Zhou, who was also CFO of Snail Games. Meng was technically employed through the gaming company but said she worked much longer hours driving Shi and Ying around on “work and personal business,” picking up dry cleaning and “retrieving luxury items on their behalf,” caring for the couple’s children at their Beverly Hills mansion, shopping, making travel arrangements, conducting “internet research,” translating, making doctor appointments, cooking and cleaning, and more. Meng claimed she was “on call” for 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EwwyH"&gt;The company allegedly had Meng do many of these tasks for another executive for a telecommunications company affiliated with Snail Games, too, on top of her work for Shi and Ying. When Meng tried to get compensated for what she believed should be considered overtime work, Snail Games allegedly bucked. Meng also alleged that Shi often treated her in “a hostile and disparaging manner,” including telling her not to have children because she would end up “dedicating her life” to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="66k2SX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The founder has been accused of bad behavior in lawsuits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PsvPjH"&gt;Meng started submitting time cards for what she believed were unpaid wages in 2019. In June of that year, “shortly after” she dropped off Shi at Los Angeles International Airport, she was fired over email. The two sides are still apparently working out a settlement agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBvhVm"&gt;A spokesperson for the company said these lawsuits are “all frivolous” and that they have been resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPPr95"&gt;As for how IndiEV originally came together, it’s still not totally clear. Beyond Shi, some of the earliest employees included a former human resources manager from Faraday Future, as well as Miles Bernal, the man who once claimed in his own lawsuit to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;run operations at the mansions Faraday Future founder Jia Yueting bought on the Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03YzcB"&gt;For what it’s worth, IndiEV is at least now trying to engage with the public about what it’s doing, as opposed to something like fellow California EV startup Alpha Motors, which has &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1133401_confusion-brews-as-retro-style-ev-startup-alpha-motor-turns-on-the-charm"&gt;done nothing to date to prove it’s not some kind of joke or scam&lt;/a&gt;. But like many other EV startups to emerge from California in recent years know well —  from Faraday Future to Fisker Inc. to Karma Automotive — IndiEV likely has an incredibly hard road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deathloop’s huge new update brings DLSS, DualSense audio for PC, crash fixes, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0eoHjN-MZO-6aZ6i-HEU4jAQBY=/477x0:2637x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996388/deathloop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="03Ljq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is an incredible game&lt;/a&gt; but also one with its fair share of nasty issues, particularly on PC — where some have experienced seriously stuttery performance and a nasty crash just as &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; supposed to crash the game’s penultimate party. Now, it appears Arkane Studios is coming fast and furious with the fixes and a little something extra as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esTha6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5PwYCbups6Rw217NBm46gw/deathloops-game-update-1-now-available"&gt;A new 11GB update&lt;/a&gt; can add extra immersion to PC by letting you hear Julianna’s radio transmissions through a connected PS5 controller. Plus there’s brand-new support for Nvidia DLSS, letting you potentially eke out a substantial amount of extra performance if you’re willing to exchange your native resolution for a slickly AI-upscaled version. (The game supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s rival FSR&lt;/a&gt; from the get-go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHIEz4"&gt;The patch (which is 5GB on PS5) also includes “improved NPC pathing and reactions to the player,” which would seem to address an issue the community’s had with how dumb the AI can sometimes seem, and an HDR calibration screen that you got on PC but was missing from the console release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG64uU"&gt;For PC, I’m hoping “improved performance and stability, especially with ray tracing” means no more crashes at Aleksis’ party in the evening. “Fixed issues that were causing dropped frames and hitches in camera movement” is obviously an intended fix for the stuttering &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu_XHyO-6zY"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; uncovered&lt;/a&gt; last month, but keep in mind that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684588/deathloop-stutter-pc-game-nvidia-amd-rtx-vrr-gsync-vsync-fps-framerate"&gt;there were several distinct issues&lt;/a&gt; and Bethesda already released a patch on September 21st that fixed some of them. I haven’t had the issue since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8quHX"&gt;Here’s the full changelog: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pressure mounts on Amazon and App Store discrimination in new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary&amp;amp;nbsp;Hearing Examining Texas Abortion Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EAgY24Qll4PShIsoqKrUHnwBqfQ=/2x0:4325x2882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996120/1235582856.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23lhwP"&gt;After months of hearings and negotiations, pressure is growing in the Senate to pass new laws banning online platforms from giving preference to their own products and services over those of their competitors. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators announced plans to introduce a nondiscrimination bill that could reshape Amazon’s online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nC5IJK"&gt;The American Choice and Innovation Online Act, led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), would prevent platforms like Amazon, Apple, and Google from using their dominance to disadvantage other companies and competitors that use their platforms. In June, House lawmakers voted out a bill sharing the same name from the Judiciary Committee. Klobuchar’s Senate version isn’t identical to the House’s, but shares similar language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EOmJW"&gt;This announcement follows a Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Amazon used marketplace search data to copy popular products and manipulate results favoring the company’s own knockoff products. A Thursday &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also showed that the company places its products ahead of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v09bTW"&gt;For years, third-party sellers have accused Amazon of similar behavior. These accusations were part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;a yearslong House antitrust investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon and other tech giants by lawmakers, spurring the original bipartisan bill in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgMFrj"&gt;“When dominant tech companies exclude rivals &amp;amp; kill competition, it hurts small businesses and can increase costs for YOU,” Klobuchar said in a tweet on Thursday. “My new bipartisan legislation with [Grassley] will establish new rules of the road to prevent large companies from boxing out their smaller competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReUveI"&gt;Outside of Amazon, the bill could also change how Apple and Google run their app stores, banning the companies from giving preference to their own first-party apps and software. Earlier this year, Apple was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ordered to allow app developers&lt;/a&gt; to send iOS users to payment options outside of those offered by the iPhone manufacturer in a case brought by Epic Games. Google is facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;a similar suit&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2nh35"&gt;As of publication, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1448694019631063045?s=20"&gt;said that at least five Senate Republicans&lt;/a&gt; have signed onto the legislation, including Sens. Cynthia Lummis (WY), Josh Hawley (MO), Lindsey Graham (SC), and John Kennedy (LA). This bipartisan support marks a significant step forward for lawmakers seeking to regulate online marketplaces, showing that both Republicans and Democrats are willing to work together to spur competition in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnFVWe"&gt;“Many ‘critics’ called our bipartisan antitrust bils ‘Democrat bills,’” Buck said in a tweet. “That was false then, and it’s false now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJYHZV"&gt;Despite the measure’s broad congressional support, trade groups like Chamber of Progress issued statements Thursday suggesting that the bill will hurt customer experiences online, not enhance them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ueilx"&gt;“Preventing Amazon from selling Amazon Basics and banning Google’s maps from its search results isn’t going to do anything to make the Internet better for families,” Adam Kovacevich, founder and CEO of Chamber of Progress said in a Thursday statement. “This is like calling a car mechanic to fix your laptop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsjtWs"&gt;The Chamber of Progress coalition partners with tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsJJNn"&gt;Pressure is mounting for Congress to act on online marketplaces and counterfeit products as well. Last week, House lawmakers introduced &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILLS-117hr5502ih.pdf"&gt;the INFORM Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require platforms like Amazon to verify the identities of high-volume sellers in order to curb the sale of knockoff products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEgpTz"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c81HwL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3T9jl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I have a hard time believing your wearable is good if you had to Photoshop it onto a model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGvbmEKJq6-eGyqTxZfri_UVOvs=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996004/me_time_1_1920.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wqhndD"&gt;Wearable gadgets live or die on whether they’re actually comfortable to &lt;em&gt;wear — &lt;/em&gt;it’s tough to recommend a fitness tracker that gives me a rash or a headset constantly dragging my head down. So, for HTC’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22713276/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-launch-price-hands-on"&gt;new, exceptionally light Vive Flow VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, the company wanted to show just how effortlessly it might fit into your life, commissioning pictures of men and women wearing it in their cozy living rooms without a care in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9wG4J"&gt;One rather important reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they don’t seem to care: they’re not&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wearing it at all. It’s photoshopped. The woman in the photo above was actually photographed with a bowl of popcorn, not a headset or a phone. Here’s what the original looks like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.istockphoto.com%2Fphoto%2Fgirl-on-the-sofa-in-the-living-room-eating-popcorn-gm1199696793-343351767&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22726604%2Fhtc-vive-flow-wearable-photoshopped-wearable-models-stock-images" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at istockphoto.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E4tE6vh1UubAH8Nch3YA4h7JjuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927318/istockphoto_1199696793_1024x1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Girl on the sofa in the living room eating popcorn”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zPYfRL"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jank0/status/1448431947751952384"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol’s &lt;/em&gt;Janko Roettgers pointed out yesterday on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of HTC’s leaked lifestyle images of the HTC Vive Flow appear to have come from istockphoto.com, and HTC is prominently using the final versions of those pictures on its public-facing website now. Here are a couple more (with image sliders for you to drag):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ECIVKK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10807659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="IvRkf8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10807661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Udn9mR"&gt;It could be worse. They could have forced a ridiculous smile onto somebody’s face, an image which I don’t see on the final website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3dRbRL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/YwdAsu44zF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YwdAsu44zF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Janko Roettgers (@jank0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jank0/status/1448432530026221569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GbNPcA"&gt;Or, they could have pulled a Panasonic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22642035/panasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker"&gt;photoshopped a white man’s head onto a black man’s body&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to shopping in their wearable speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j09gOu"&gt;This is the second time in two months we’re seeing a wearable gadget digitally added to a person’s body, and it’s weird. It’s misleading, and — fair or no — my gut reaction is to wonder what these companies might be trying to hide. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22713276/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-launch-price-hands-on"&gt;My colleague Adi Robertson said&lt;/a&gt; the headset kept slipping down her face in demos, but she also tried a different face gasket that worked better.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYac4H"&gt;This is a bad look, particularly for wearables. Please stop it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook starts rolling out end-to-end encrypted backups to WhatsApp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/baC9LNYnvZvVo5H-YrZ5CV4BA7A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69995992/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aohsGf"&gt;WhatsApp’s end-to-end encrypted chat backups for iOS and Android are available starting Thursday, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/end-to-end-encrypted-backups-on-whatsapp/"&gt;Facebook announced&lt;/a&gt;. The company has offered end-to-end encryption for chats for years, but with this new change, you can get that same level of encryption with your backups. The feature will be rolling out “slowly” for people on the latest version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAnc07"&gt;WhatsApp backups are stored in iCloud or Google Drive, but that means that Apple or Google could hand over the backups to governments or law enforcement if compelled. With the change available on Thursday, you can secure your WhatsApp cloud backups with a password or a 64-digit encryption key, which theoretically means that no one else but you will be able to access the backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9UODV"&gt;You can read more about how the encrypted backups work in our article about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22665968/whatsapp-backups-end-to-end-encryption-ios-android"&gt;the original announcement of the feature&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/241394876_546674233234181_8907137889500301879_n.pdf/WhatsApp_Security_Encrypted_Backups_Whitepaper.pdf?ccb=1-5&amp;amp;_nc_sid=2fbf2a&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=oiRyD5qWtVQAX__blUu&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&amp;amp;oh=598371795440bda67db32677567cc560&amp;amp;oe=616DD33C"&gt;a white paper from Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to turn on end-to-end encrypted backups for your account, Facebook has &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-turn-on-and-turn-off-end-to-end-encrypted-backup"&gt;a guide you can follow here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onAdeG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 14th, 4:31PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added details about the rollout of end-to-end encryption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal’s founder is trolling with an NFT that’ll turn to shit if you buy it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V77lHDVxBl2gxwCAoOk899qg_9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69995554/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ygwQr6"&gt;Secure messaging app Signal’s founder Moxie Marlinspike is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1448066579611234305"&gt;doing a bit of trolling&lt;/a&gt; by releasing an NFT that shows up differently depending on what platform you’re looking at it on — and that will, allegedly, display as a poop emoji in your wallet if you actually buy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htTl2i"&gt;He seems to be doing this to point out the potential fragility of NFTs, which are supposed to act as a sort of permanent record of owning a piece of art or media. They’re unique digital tokens that are stored on the blockchain, but in most cases, it’s actually just the record that lives on the chain — the image is stored elsewhere. That means that people shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars for them could be at the mercy of image hosts who are operating independently from the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QZGGpl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I created an NFT, but the image renders differently based on who's looking at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, on OpenSea: &lt;a href="https://t.co/XI0hSerW5y"&gt;https://t.co/XI0hSerW5y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...vs on Rarible: &lt;a href="https://t.co/gQTH4tcR9k"&gt;https://t.co/gQTH4tcR9k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...vs if you own it, it currently renders as a large   emoji in your wallet. How this works:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/n&lt;/p&gt;— Moxie Marlinspike (@moxie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1448066579611234305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWJ4Xs"&gt;It’s no secret that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;many NFTs would be in peril&lt;/a&gt; if the servers hosting them were to go down. For the most part, they’re not stored on the blockchain; the art is just a link. According to Marlinspike, that’s how he’s pulling this off — he’s made the image render differently based on the IP or user agent that’s requesting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5TIKTC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10807563"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0512kL"&gt;(And yes, I have checked to make sure that both the &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307:1?tab=history"&gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307/1"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; pages are actually displaying &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307?a=1#inventory"&gt;the same token&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve got doubts, you can use Rarible’s “View on OpenSea” button, located in the “...” menu to see for yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V14x9G"&gt;It probably won’t be a surprise that someone named Moxie Marlinspike is no stranger to trolling and IRL antics. &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/"&gt;There are stories&lt;/a&gt; of him buying and crashing a hot air balloon or using a picture of himself in an asparagus-shaped hat as his profile at a very serious conference. And who can forget &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/"&gt;the Instagram ads Signal tried to run&lt;/a&gt; that showed what Facebook’s advertising profile thinks about you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ee39bo"&gt;Marlinspike is also no stranger to having off-the-beaten-path political views that have led to him being labeled an anarchist (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14244634/signal-app-secure-messaging-trump-surveillance-encryption"&gt;we asked him years ago&lt;/a&gt; if that label was accurate, and he said it was complicated); he’s heavily &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1267486874441932800"&gt;advocated against law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/"&gt;said that their jobs should be difficult&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amYwgc"&gt;What I’m getting at is that it’s not surprising that he’s poking some fun at NFTs and how they work. It is a bit odd, though, that he seems confused as to why people would be bidding on an NFT that turns into a poop emoji. I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;have you seen some of the NFTs people buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; A $400 bid for a changing NFT seems totally believable at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GuvtiM"&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 review: overpriced and underpowered</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A polished PC with inconsistent performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="idJmew"&gt;I can’t tell you how excited I was to test the Zephyrus M16. It takes the AMD-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;’s exceptional chassis and adds the two things I most wish that laptop had: a 16:10 display and a webcam. That sounds like a great package on paper, but there’s one other major thing that also differentiates the M16 from the G15: its Intel processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sHSeT"&gt;A review of the M16, then, isn’t just an opportunity to evaluate Asus’ product. It’s also an opportunity to answer a question I’ve been wondering since I first reviewed the G15 earlier this year (and gave the highest score I’ve given a laptop in my career): how much of the G15’s excellence has to do with Asus’s engineering, and how much has to do with the combined power and efficiency of AMD’s processors? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Republic of Gamers Est 2006 nameplate on the bottom right corner of the Zephyrus M16 lid." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGOtnGldIXGFYGMrHmvZMS9z_Ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810020/akrales_210824_4725_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just wish this had an RTX 3070.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YtJzJP"&gt;The M16 has rendered a fairly clear verdict: a lot of it is AMD. The Zephyrus G15 leaves the M16 in the dust, not just in terms of raw frame rates and battery life, but in terms of power-per-dollar. While the Zephyrus M16 does have a few advantages that will be significant for some, the Zephyrus G15 is unambiguously better value for the majority of shoppers. The M16 has a gorgeous chassis with a standout display, but it’s also a real-world illustration of how far behind Intel currently is in value as well as efficiency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Cyoc3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10807135"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2qrqo9PH4DOOy0ovbpbdQdRZo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810027/akrales_210824_4725_0125.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love this keyboard, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fQ0h1q"&gt;In addition to the screen and processor, the significant differentiator between the M16 and the G15 is price. There are two M16 models listed on &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-m16-series/wtb"&gt;Asus’ website&lt;/a&gt;: my test model (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMTBHVU05f" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,849.99&lt;/a&gt;) with a Core i9-11900H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a QHD 165Hz display, and a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMTEwcmP6g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,449 option&lt;/a&gt; with a Core i7-11800H, an RTX 3050 Ti, a 512GB SSD, and a 1920 x 1200 144Hz display. (The latter one is kind of an odd configuration — 512GB really isn’t a lot of storage for a gaming laptop, and the 3050 Ti isn’t going to take full advantage of a 144Hz screen on a lot of titles.) A G15 with an RTX 3060 is &lt;a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/rog/catalog/product/view/id/1795/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;significantly cheaper&lt;/a&gt; at $1,499 — though that model only has 512GB of storage, it also has a more efficient Ryzen 9 5900HS processor. &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-15-6-qhd-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-1tb-ssd-eclipse-grey-eclipse-grey%2F6448848.p%3FskuId%3D6448848&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $1,849.99&lt;/a&gt;, you can get a G15 with specs identical to this M16 model but a more powerful RTX 3070. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 facing away from the camera, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ol_2eIlCiCMgGrLKJwSQHiWtJyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810021/akrales_210824_4725_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bigger battery, bigger charger, better screen, and better chips than the previous Zephyrus M15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TVtX3X"&gt;So the Intel-based M16 is already fighting an uphill battle when it comes to value. What does the extra money get you? It’s mostly the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aehtli"&gt;If you’re looking for a QHD 165Hz display with a 16:10 aspect ratio (which allows Asus to cram a 16-incher into a chassis that’s not much bigger than most 15-inch gaming laptops), the Zephyrus M16 is one of few places you’ll find it. Put this next to the G15, and the main difference you’ll notice is that where the G15 has a large and visible chin, the M16 just has more screen. The bottom bezel (at least, the part that’s visible) is borderline nonexistent and gives you a noticeable amount of extra room when scrolling a web page or reading a document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfT7zZ"&gt;Vertical space aside, though, the screen is also phenomenal. It’s bright, maxing out at 444 nits, and vivid, covering 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, 86 percent of Adobe RGB, and 98 percent of P3. It’s significantly brighter than the G15’s screen, and the difference does show. Games and images were gorgeous to look at, with sharp colors and details, and the matte texture eliminates all glare even at low levels of brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FvHaSl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Where the G15 has a large and visible chin, the M16 just has more screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlowEW"&gt;The M16 also has a slight advantage as an Intel system in that it can support Thunderbolt 4. It has a Thunderbolt 4 port in addition to a Type-C, a power port, an Ethernet jack, a headphone jack, an HDMI, and a USB-A port on the left and a microSD slot, a lock slot, and a USB-A on the right. It’s a good selection, though I wish the ports were more evenly distributed — seven of the 10 are on the left side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnQr9e"&gt;The M16 has one other feature that’s unique among the recent Zephyrus line: a webcam. Yes, there is a webcam! Both the G15 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702219/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2021-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the G14&lt;/a&gt; lack this feature, and I’m really not sure why — while not everyone needs one, it would make both laptops more attractive purchases for anyone like me who’s often on video calls. The M16’s 720p camera isn’t great, but it’s not terrible, and that’s saying a lot for a laptop webcam. I was fairly clear on Zoom calls, and the noise-canceling microphones did a fine job of picking up my voice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9xIM7NG_mzhvz_LPEYEM6iI0yk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810026/akrales_210824_4725_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right: power port, HDMI 2.0b, RJ45, USB-A, Type-C with Thunderbolt 4, Type-C, combo audio jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ports on the right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cykyhIY3G9xI0Al7I_RE66y0WGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810023/akrales_210824_4725_0067.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left: Kensington lock, microSD (312MB/s), USB-A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aroa02"&gt;But the M16 doesn’t hold up to its AMD counterpart in most other areas — and unfortunately, gaming is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CySMQ"&gt;The M16 averaged 236fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, meaning it will take full advantage of the 165Hz screen on easier esports titles. But it had more trouble on AAA games. It averaged 46fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultra preset (55fps with DLSS on “Quality,” 48fps in 1440p) and 42fps with all sliders maxed. On &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s highest preset, the M16 averaged 38fps with ray tracing on Ultra (46fps with DLSS on, 40fps in 1440p) and 63fps with ray tracing off (68fps in 1440p). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VZHCWO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, there is a webcam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XIyMRr"&gt;Those results look reasonable — until you compare them to the G15. The AMD-powered machine that we tested is the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMTE5VRmOS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exact same price&lt;/a&gt; as this M16 unit, but it has a GeForce RTX 3070. That’s technically only one step up from the RTX 3060, but these numbers illustrate how big that step is. The G15 (at 2560 x 1440) got 58fps on&lt;em&gt; Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; on Ultra, 61fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing on, and 81fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing off. That’s a sound drubbing from an identically priced unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JO8gCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10807200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtqscF"&gt;In fact, these results are closer to those we saw from the G14 (which has the same GPU as this M16 model but in a much smaller chassis). The M16 is beating that model by fewer than 10fps on both &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. (That device also isn’t the best value — with just a 120Hz display, it’s currently going for &lt;a href="https://www.excaliberpc.com/768172/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-ga401qm-211.zg14b.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 less than this M16&lt;/a&gt;.) Overall, I don’t see much reason to buy the M16 over the G15 that’s exactly the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6US73"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Six hours isn’t a great result for a laptop that’s supposed to be able to double as a primary driver&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvpaPZ"&gt;Battery life didn’t help the M16’s case. The G15 and the G14 both basically never die, but I was averaging just under six and a half hours from using the M16 as my daily work driver with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s a couple hours shorter than what I averaged on the G15 and only a bit more than what we saw from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22723299/razer-blade-15-advanced-late-2021-review-specs-features-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same GPU but a much smaller battery. Intra-Asus comparisons aside, six hours isn’t a great result for a laptop that’s supposed to be able to double as a primary driver when needed (which is the primary benefit of the 16:10 screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKvRXi"&gt;Battery gaming wasn’t much better. I only got 57 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; play out of one charge, where I got an hour and 21 minutes out of the G15. The experience wasn’t great either: the game began stuttering around 22 minutes in and became unplayable (with crackling and distorted audio) at 42 minutes in with 20 percent remaining. The M16’s battery is the same size as the G15’s (90Wh) and it has a weaker GPU, so this looks like it’s on Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgHAHn"&gt;Charging was also a bit slow. The 240W charger took 50 minutes to juice the device up to 60 percent with light Chrome use. (The M16 also supports 100W Type-C charging, but that will be even slower.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The dot matrix on the lower left corner of the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16’s lid." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2oF4OdlOBok8EHSJtxQTiD5vZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810019/akrales_210824_4725_0029.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No little LEDs here, as there are on some G14 models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The power button on the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSxr59yy5sV2OA62xqfz2qioSB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810024/akrales_210824_4725_0079.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a fingerprint sensor in the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N1CzRo"&gt;Raw performance isn’t the only place where the M16 struggled to keep up. The cooling system is also very loud — even among gaming laptops. The G15’s fans never drowned out my games’ audio, but I really struggled to hear the speakers over the M16’s noise. They were also pretty obtrusive, even when I was just working in Chrome. You’ll want to turn on Silent mode if you’re not gaming. (To Asus’ credit, the fans were effective — I rarely saw the CPU pass 80 degrees Celsius, and it was often in the mid-70s or high 60s during benchmark runs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z60qnK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Charging was a bit slow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8L2kHu"&gt;It didn’t help that the M16’s speakers (two tweeters and two force-canceling woofers) aren’t super loud. Vocals were clear and songs well-balanced, but they didn’t fill my studio apartment, and I sometimes found myself having to lean forward to hear while I was trying to watch YouTube videos, even with volume maxed out. You can use Dolby Access to jump between equalizer presets for gaming, movies, music, and voice calls — the gaming and movies profiles sound a bit tinny on these speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 open, seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSfMFqPC6iXhChYNWjAHFu9dY64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22810022/akrales_210824_4725_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Arc Flow fans have 84 blades as thin as 0.2mm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zs48DF"&gt;Everything else about the M16 is standard Zephyrus stuff. It’s the exact same weight and almost the same thickness as the G15, at 4.19 pounds and 0.75 inches —  portable as 15-inch gaming rigs go. It’s got the familiar dot matrix covering its lid and Asus’ signature ErgoLift hinge that folds beneath the screen and raises the keyboard up slightly (hiding much of the bottom bezel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EkaXP"&gt;The keyboard is great, and the touchpad is massive, with a smooth surface and a very easy click. I did occasionally have palm-rejection issues — the cursor jumped pretty much whenever my palm hit the touchpad. This got bothersome enough that I ended up turning off touchpad input when I was playing games with external peripherals. But overall, it’s an excellent chassis that’s sturdy and sleek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="YPycUG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10807214"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fz8dPW"&gt;In a vacuum, there’s nothing particularly objectionable about the Zephyrus M16. The exceptional 16:10 display and the, well, existence of a webcam are great additions — and they make the M16 more pragmatic as a primary work driver than other gaming laptops in its class. The addition of Thunderbolt and Intel-specific features like Quick Sync will be icing on the cake for creative professionals who won’t be able to find those benefits in an AMD system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQJxZX"&gt;However, the M16 is still a Zephyrus. It’s not intended to be a primary work driver or for coffee-shop creatives; it is, first and foremost, a gaming laptop. And it’s too expensive for its performance. It provides a weaker GPU, worse battery life, and a significantly worse battery-gaming experience than comparably priced AMD systems. You’re paying for this webcam and incredible screen not only with extra money but also with frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XFoDp9"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s no audience for the M16. The screen, the upgraded ports, and the webcam aren’t trivial bonuses. The M16 isn’t a bad laptop, but most gamers will be happier with the G15 — and I wish Asus would put this screen and this webcam on that product.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dio3OF"&gt;Spotify is making it easier to get ahold of &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-13/spotify-launches-our-newest-exploration-a-limited-release-of-car-thing-a-smart-player-for-your-car/"&gt;its first hardware device, the Car Thing&lt;/a&gt;, by opening up &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-14/5-things-to-know-about-the-newest-limited-release-of-car-thing/"&gt;a waitlist to purchase the device&lt;/a&gt; that anyone can join starting today. The catch is that now the streaming service’s previously invite-only product is $79.99 when it used to be free with paid shipping and handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cut30D"&gt;While Spotify will let anyone with an account sign up for its waitlist, whether free or premium, you do still need a premium account to actually use the device. Also, at its new $79.99 price, it’s worth re-examining what the Car Thing can do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFfou4ECRJysy5XRDzDYq5t89hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439218/carthing1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Car Thing comes with a selection of mounts for your car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjW14S"&gt;The Car Thing is not a standalone Spotify device. It connects to your phone over Bluetooth and uses a phone’s internet connection to stream and control playback on songs and podcasts from Spotify’s library. The Car Thing is also totally reliant on your phone’s Bluetooth, USB, or auxiliary cable connection to your car, which basically makes the device a glorified Spotify remote.&lt;/p&gt;

The Car Thing is just limited — even though Spotify plans to update it — and it’s no longer “free.” I’d recommend really considering whether it’s worth it before you sign up to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making it easier to doomscroll through search results</title>

  &lt;p id="IjUwPT"&gt;Google is making it easier to doomscroll through search results by automatically loading newer results as you get to the end of the page. Previously, when you got to the end of a page of Google search results, there was a big “See more” button at the bottom you could tap to, well, see more results. With continuously loaded results, you’ll be able to just keep on scrolling to see more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WqGkOA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beginning today, continuous scrolling is starting to roll out to Google Search for most English searches on mobile devices in the US.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sij3lI"&gt;Continuous scrolling does have some advantages; it’s a lot easier to see more results quickly if you don’t have to consciously make a choice to tap the “See more” button. I can’t say I’m looking forward to this change, though, since reaching the end of a Google search page was often a natural place for me to consider if I had learned enough or if I wanted to seek out more information. With continuous scrolling, it might be harder for me to pull myself away from the page, which is something I already struggle with while using social networks with endlessly loading feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmZmre"&gt;Continuous scrolling is starting to “gradually” roll out Thursday for “most English searches on mobile in the US,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/continuous-scrolling-mobile/"&gt;according to a Google blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
