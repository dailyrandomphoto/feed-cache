    <title>Ed Sheeran is coming to Pokémon Go to serenade Squirtles in sunglasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p9Bc2ghE8jLUqcgqzEiIFvQmJls=/0x0:767x511/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158624/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ed Sheeran (right) serenades a Squirtle with sunglasses (left). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9obwJE"&gt;Niantic has released details of Pokémon Go’s upcoming Ed Sheeran collaboration in a &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/ed-sheeran-collab/?hl=en"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, a little over a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785361/ed-sheeran-pokemon-go-crossover"&gt;first teasing&lt;/a&gt; the surprising crossover. The event kicks off on November 22nd at 2pm ET (11am PT), and will run for a little over a week until November 30th. The main feature appears to be a performance of some sort from Ed Sheeran, though what form this will take (a pre-recorded video? A virtual Ed avatar?) isn’t at all clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vBdnO"&gt;Niantic says the performance will include songs from Sheeran’s new album, titled =&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(yes, the name of the album is the equals sign), and that it’ll be accessible from the News section of the Pokémon Go app. Right now, this section is just a news feed of announcements and blog posts, so this doesn’t offer much of a hint about what shape the performance will take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EliX97"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That’s not all! In celebration of Ed Sheeran’s favorite Pokémon, Squirtle wearing sunglasses will be returning to Pokémon GO!  &lt;br&gt;We might be “Thinking Out Loud,” but the thought of catching this Squirtle again feels so “Perfect” that it’s giving us “Shivers.”&lt;/p&gt;— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1461201258522583048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BQmYtO"&gt;With the event, Niantic appears to be attempting to follow in the footsteps of Epic Games, which has offered a number of in-game music events in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; over the years from artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;. Epic has cited pop culture events like these as a key part of its attempt to expand &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from a game into a metaverse-style social space, and Niantic hasn’t been shy about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22768925/niantic-lightship-developer-platform-john-hanke-pokemon-go"&gt;its own metaverse plans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSsgoK"&gt;As well as Sheeran’s performance, the event will also include more typical Pokémon Go gameplay elements. A number of water-type pokémon and the special sunglasses-wearing variety of Squirtle will be available to catch (“Ed always chooses the water-type pokémon as his first partner” you see), and there’ll also be a branded &lt;em&gt;= &lt;/em&gt;sweatshirts you can equip your avatar with. Over the course of the week, Ed Sheeran’s song “Overpass Graffiti” will also play during the night in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGo0gY"&gt;In-game events like these are big business for Niantic. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-19-pokemon-go-levelled-up-its-storytelling-at-a-memorable-go-fest"&gt;This year’s Go Fest event&lt;/a&gt;, which took place in July, reportedly brought in around $21 million in revenue over the course of two days, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-21-pokemon-go-fest-2021-earned-gbp15m-in-two-days"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mario Kart Live’s 2.0 update makes multiplayer much easier and cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9tsMw6wUWqfpMP4c2mniP_e7Dg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158491/Switch_MarioKartLiveHomeCircuit_screen_12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nq1snK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo’s AR-powered Mario Kart game that lets you race physical toy karts around your home with the Nintendo Switch, just got updated to version 2.0 with a much-requested feature: splitscreen local multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpFAIr"&gt;Previously, multiplayer &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt; was a complex and costly endeavor. You’d need two karts — the base game only comes with one — as well as two Nintendo Switch consoles, and the action would play out on each player’s Switch screen. With the 2.0 update, you can hook up one Switch to a TV so both players can stay on the couch as they race their karts around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="abG3kC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit is a simple racer that can feel like magic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch"},{"title":"Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit’s multiplayer is expensive and chaotic","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21526662/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-multiplayer-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KI565H"&gt;There’s also a new Relay Race mode that allows for multiplayer games with just a single kart. Between two and four players can select their own characters, with control switching between them after every lap. In addition, the update is adding a new tournament called the Luigi Cup along with three new courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBp1sw"&gt;Nintendo is further lowering the barrier to entry by including &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt; in its Black Friday sales. The game —including one kart — will cost $59.99 from November 21st, which saves you $40 off the MSRP. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>That ‘real’ Disney lightsaber? You’ll never get to touch it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PA7qKQyjlAChnUlnjWGDEtTHX04=/87x0:1193x737/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157818/uih3yt7ygu67tu112.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;© Disney © &amp;amp; TM Lucasfilm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MzUM61"&gt;I have some terrible news: Disney has confirmed you’ll never get to try the “real” retractable lightsaber &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/9/22375720/disney-parks-lightsaber-retractable-blade-rumor-patent"&gt;whose very existence&lt;/a&gt;, subsequent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418959/disney-real-lightsaber-reveal-video-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel"&gt;reveal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380919/disney-real-lightsaber-patent-star-wars-ben-ridout"&gt;patented design&lt;/a&gt; made us giddy back in April and May of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4XGSMx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Disney’s ‘real’ lightsaber patent actually works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380919/disney-real-lightsaber-patent-star-wars-ben-ridout"},{"title":"Disney reveals its ‘real’ lightsaber, and it looks extremely cool","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418959/disney-real-lightsaber-reveal-video-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OzgZ8b"&gt;While the incredible disappearing lightsaber replica will indeed feature at Disney’s new Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609764/disney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Westworld-&lt;/em&gt;esque experience for the very wealthy where stays cost upwards of $4,800&lt;/a&gt; and yet is already sold out &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/disneys-ridiculous-star-wars-hotel-is-sold-out-for-4-mo-1848035173"&gt;for its first four months&lt;/a&gt; — GameSpot and &lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;report that Disney won’t be letting you touch that lightsaber for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkM56m"&gt;“Unfortunately, that lightsaber isn’t for guests to use or purchase. It’s strictly for use by the performers,” &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-preview"&gt;writes IGN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WaXOh"&gt;“Trowbridge confirmed in a group interview that guests will never actually use that lightsaber, but that it will be part of the Galactic Starcruiser experience,” &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-playtested-disneys-immersive-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel-heres-what-we-learned/1100-6498103/"&gt;says &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSgdmA"&gt;Damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hBjAq"&gt;Your multi-thousand dollar ticket does include some lightsaber training, though. GameSpot continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NsAJa9"&gt;Instead, you will be given what feels like a high-end, yet slimmed-down lightsaber replica with a fixed blade. You power it up and all of the sounds and vibrations you would expect are there, but if you walk in expecting to get to play with the new one Disney has developed, let this serve as a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TLAu0S"&gt;Here’s IGN again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZBkmuu"&gt;The session involves using the provided lightsabers to deflect laser beams fired by a wall-mounted training remote. It starts off slow, letting you get a feel for how it works, and then it ramps up to Jedi level where you’re Forced to block attacks without even seeing the lasers. The lightsaber used in this activity feels about on par with a Force FX lightsaber, though it is a tad shorter, but it’s only meant to be used for lightsaber training and won’t be available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HCVaRu"&gt;Here’s some concept art for that and other experiences Disney wants to offer in the Galactic Starcruiser — it doesn’t appear to have let &lt;em&gt;IGN, GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; or any other outlets photograph the actual experience, though you can read more about at those source links.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pay equity and harassment organizer will leave the company after reaching a settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XqM3nqv3p-ZADvT0eYbRAvCJlrw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157708/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TASCwe"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple engineer who helped organize pay equity surveys and anti-harassment / discrimination campaigns at the company, will be leaving the company and requesting the withdrawal of a complaint she made to the National Labor Relations Board (or NLRB), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/apple-worker-who-led-protest-movement-leaving-after-settlement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The software engineer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1461078948436054016"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Friday would be her last day at Apple. Scarlett’s lawyers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that she had reached a private settlement with the company, but she declined to provide details about the terms when asked by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lECwx"&gt;Scarlett is leaving voluntarily, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, unlike some other organizers who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;were fired from the company after speaking out&lt;/a&gt;. During her time at Apple, she &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/14/apple-worker-cher-scarlett/"&gt;was reportedly accused of leaking information to the press&lt;/a&gt; by other employees, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;that’s strongly discouraged by Apple leadership&lt;/a&gt;, and that she denies doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YRB9ez"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Friday is my last day at Apple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m taking a bit of time to decide where I’d like to go next, and will announce when I’ve made that decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett   (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1461078948436054016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV0cDB"&gt;The charge she’s requested be withdrawn was filed in September, when Scarlett said that Apple had “engaged in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She made the complaint after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;she and others at the company struggled to conduct a pay equity survey&lt;/a&gt; for Apple employees, with the company repeatedly shutting down their attempts. Scarlett also told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that Apple wouldn’t allow employees to create a Slack room to talk about pay equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sqW6Lc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook says employees who leak memos do not belong at Apple, according to leaked memo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5l5Esy"&gt;Scarlett withdrawing her complaint won’t necessarily leave Apple in the clear — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759715/fired-apple-too-organizer-files-labor-charge-nlrb"&gt;faces a number of other complaints&lt;/a&gt;, including ones alleging wrongful termination from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729072/apple-too-organizer-janneke-parrish-interview"&gt;other employees Scarlett worked with&lt;/a&gt; to organize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;the #AppleToo movement&lt;/a&gt;. #AppleToo aimed to get support for Apple employees who experienced discrimination or harassment if the company’s policies failed to provide it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H74v6"&gt;Scarlett’s lawyers told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that they hoped the company’s employees would continue to organize, a sentiment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729072/apple-too-organizer-janneke-parrish-interview"&gt;echoed by other activists&lt;/a&gt; that are no longer with the company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Streamlabs will drop ‘OBS’ name after getting called out by open-source app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TikTok and Streamlabs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5QPHfTt-0u6Tur9uWEEZtMTglc=/44x0:5315x3514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157533/1232817024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rasit Aydogan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hIuGus"&gt;Streamlabs has promised to remove “OBS” from the name of its livestreaming software, Streamlabs OBS, following backlash from streamers and the open-source livestreaming platform OBS Studio. OBS Studio says it asked Streamlabs not to use its name, which stands for “Open Broadcaster Software,” only to have the company do so anyway. Streamlabs has also been accused of copying the website of another broadcasting software, with all the drama hashed out on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5m4XC"&gt;The controversy started when Lightstream, another livestreaming app maker, tweeted out screenshots of its website right beside Streamlabs’, saying, “Hey, can I copy your homework?” suggesting that Streamlabs copied Lightstream. Stu Grubbs, the CEO of Lightstream, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StuV2/status/1460710778462482440"&gt;later retweeted the image&lt;/a&gt;, stating, “The team at @streamlabs should be ashamed. Not satisfied enough to ride @OBSProject’s hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fys0Hu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re often faced with confused users and even companies who do not understand the difference between the two apps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Support volunteers are sometimes met with angry users demanding refunds. We've had interactions with several companies who did not realize our apps were separate.&lt;/p&gt;— OBS (@OBSProject) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1460783134295969794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="is4hej"&gt;Following Grubbs’ tweet, OBS got in on the action — in a reply to Grubb, OBS alleges that Streamlabs’ name has proven problematic for the brand. OBS says that customers and other companies have confused OBS and Streamlabs due to the “OBS” abbreviation that Streamlabs tacks on its name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lR0KBK"&gt;OBS also claims it was approached by Streamlabs when the service first launched and asked if it could use “OBS” in its name. OBS says it “kindly asked them not to,” but Streamlabs still used the name anyway. “We’ve tried to sort this out in private and they have been uncooperative at every turn,” OBS’s tweet says. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1460783258237640706"&gt;OBS acknowledges&lt;/a&gt; that Streamlabs did everything right legally but instead “repeatedly disregarded the spirit of open source and of giving back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DVqjBo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;streamlabs better resolve this entire thread of issues or i’ll be asking them to take my face off the platform + look to use another donation service. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jfJoxIvc0y"&gt;https://t.co/jfJoxIvc0y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— imane   (@imane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imane/status/1460818399374692355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIRpDL"&gt;Popular streamers quickly caught onto the drama. Pokimane, one of the most well-known personalities on Twitch, threatened to stop representing and using the platform if Streamlabs doesn’t resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xkF0R9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/00sjHsmntF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/00sjHsmntF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Streamlabs (@streamlabs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/streamlabs/status/1461044715634135046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GZSmcr"&gt;Streamlabs later responded to the accusations in a tweet, stating that it will take immediate action to remove “OBS” from its product name. It also notes that “Streamlabs OBS is built on top of the OBS open-source platform” and that its own platform is also open-source. To me, this just seems like Streamlabs’ weak justification for using the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaDhcH"&gt;Streamlabs was likely faced with no choice but to change its name, especially when a Twitch streamer with over 8 million followers threatens to stop representing the service. The entire drama does make you wonder if Streamlabs intentionally put OBS in its name to attract people to its service. After all, basically everyone in the world of streaming knows OBS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rittenhouse defense requests a mistrial after iPhone Mail app compresses key video evidence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jury Deliberates In Kyle Rittenhouse Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1HjlvEJ6r9EY5TzKd0ox35zngE=/0x0:5222x3481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157401/1236627321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic - Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gC8mJP"&gt;The Kyle Rittenhouse trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin has once again gone off track because of basic technology problems: Rittenhouse’s defense attorneys today requested a mistrial because prosecutors sent them a drone video via email, which compressed the video in size. This is after earlier arguments about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim"&gt;what pinch-to-zoom does or does not do&lt;/a&gt;, and the judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778801/kyle-rittenhouse-bruce-schroeder-screenshot-zoom-in"&gt;struggling with the screenshot features on his Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2bUF6"&gt;Rittenhouse faces five felony charges for shooting three men and killing two of them last year during a protest in Kenosha. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-verdict-watch-11-17-21/index.html"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt; the motion for a mistrial is focused on when and how defense attorneys received a copy of a drone video showing the shootings that was shown to the jury in open court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0md2S"&gt;Rittenhouse’s lawyers say they only received a copy of the drone video on November 5th, after the trial started, and that instead of the 11.2MB video possessed by the state, the file they received was just 3.6MB. “What that means is the video provided to the defense was not as clear as the video kept by the state,” the motion for mistrial claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfntYj"&gt;Prosecutors say they only obtained the video file directly from the drone operator after the trial started — the footage was already public, as it had aired on The Tucker Carlson Show on Fox News within days of the shooting during an appearance by the defendant’s first attorney, and a lower-quality version of the video was part of the defense’s exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kg07HA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Going from an iPhone to an Android, it appears, somehow compressed the file. We did not know that this would occur.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QxzwE2"&gt;The prosecutors said the individual who took the footage came to investigators after the trial had started and transferred a higher-quality version of the video to a detective via AirDrop. The detective brought the video to court, and minutes after his arrival the prosecution told defense attorneys that they had obtained a much better quality version of the video than was previously available. The detective emailed a copy to Rittenhouse’s attorney Natalie Wisco, who uses an Android mobile device, and she transferred that file to the defense’s laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjCQTk"&gt;Assistant District Attorney James Kraus told the court that “going from an iPhone to an Android, it appears, somehow compressed the file [...] we did not know that this would occur. We gave what we fully believed was the full file to Ms. Wisco [...] it came in without objection and was an exhibit for four days, displayed for the jury on full screen.” The prosecution says that they did not know the version she received was of lower quality until just a few days ago when Wisco displayed the file she had received on a defense laptop in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Bjkb"&gt;The iPhone’s Mail app &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-attachments-iph8580f163b/15.0/ios/15.0"&gt;automatically compresses video files sent as an attachment&lt;/a&gt;, and the defense attorney describes getting a renamed .mov file in a format that sounds exactly like an Apple Mail-app compressed video from an iPhone user. The defense was ultimately able to retrieve the full-resolution video file after sending an attorney to collect it on a USB stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXKcch"&gt;Wisconsin defense attorney Jessa Nicholson Goetz tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “it is not normal that video or other electronic evidence is AirDropped to defense counsel in the middle of a trial. That is &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; atypical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiVoy6"&gt;According to Goetz, Wisconsin law says that “any evidence that the state intends to use at trial must be disclosed ‘at a reasonable time before trial,’” and that “a mid-trial AirDrop in no way meets the requirements.” She also notes that prosecutors and courts in Wisconsin routinely handle video evidence. “Many police departments have body cams required, and virtually all squad cars statewide are equipped with video that turns on automatically if the vehicle’s emergency lights are activated. All of those videos are regularly provided via flash drive or CD-ROM/DVD,” says Goetz. “I have never encountered receiving a different or lower quality version of video evidence than the original video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKtsxe"&gt;As for why the procedures for handling evidence in this case seem so sloppy, Goetz tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that evidentiary rules vary from county to county, with some courts that use online portals to transfer files back and forth, some that require mailed hard copies, and others that require prosecutors to allow defense attorneys to physically retrieve whatever files they need on USB drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XNBYV"&gt;Rittenhouse’s defense initially requested a mistrial with prejudice, which would have prevented the case from being tried again. It has dropped the “with prejudice” from the request, and so far the judge has not ruled on the motion, even as the jury deliberates and looks at the video. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-live-jurors-set-to-begin-second-day-of-deliberations/2686647/"&gt;NBC 5 News&lt;/a&gt; reports that Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder says resolving the issue will require testimony from an expert witness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Barbie EV mockup debuts, and on an unrelated note, Mattel’s stock is up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TxxRHf8lxFD8RBILQxqQiXJwank=/45x0:4128x2722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157106/barbie_ev.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Mattel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZunkPg"&gt;Here are some facts. Mattel promoted a new toy Barbie car on Wednesday by showing off a full-size mockup at the 2021 LA Auto Show. The mockup was, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/barbie-extra-car-debut-mattel-walmart-la-auto-show/?PostType=link&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-11-17T20%3A01%3A39&amp;amp;ServiceType=twitter&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&amp;amp;UniqueID=2D7EA42A-47E1-11EC-AF77-5CDABDCD475E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on an all-electric Fiat 500e. Not long after, Mattel’s stock &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MAT/"&gt;pared back early-morning losses&lt;/a&gt; and finished the day’s trading slightly in the green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT7dFA"&gt;Now, are those things related? Probably not. But weirder things have happened, especially lately. Hertz announced a deal with Tesla and hired Tom Brady to make commercials, and then Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-says-tesla-hasnt-signed-deal-with-hertz-despite-earlier-announcement-11635854363"&gt;said the deal wasn’t done&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/548473/rivian-thrid-most-valuable-automaker%E2%80%9E/"&gt;passed every automaker in market cap except for Toyota and Tesla&lt;/a&gt; despite only shipping a few electric pickup trucks. Startups like Faraday Future, Canoo, and Lordstown Motors have collectively raised billions of dollars even though they won’t sell cars until next year &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83bl9P"&gt;The funny thing is we’re not really &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; far off from a world where Mattel could try to “make” and sell a (limited run) real-life Barbie EV. Traditional suppliers like Magna and newcomers like Foxconn are developing electric vehicle platforms that are meant to be easily adaptable to different cabins, or “top hats,” so some of the hardest work is already done. In fact, Fisker Inc., which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787670/fiskers-electric-ocean-suv-rotating-touchscreen-la-auto-show"&gt;showed off its electric SUV a few hours before the Barbie car debuted&lt;/a&gt;, is already doing this. It has taken an extremely “asset-light” approach by outsourcing its manufacturing to Magna (and will also do the same with Foxconn) and is instead far more focused on design and in-car experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVJA59"&gt;If we’ve learned anything from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks"&gt;last two years of weird money news&lt;/a&gt;, it’s that even if the technical and logistical barriers to an otherwise hard idea are now lower, there are still far easier ways to do some financial shenanigans if that’s truly the goal. In fact, it seems so easy at times that companies regularly now find themselves tripping over a new, higher stock price — kind of like what probably happened with Mattel on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LIFFW"&gt;Never mind all that, though, because now I’m going to spend the rest of the day thinking about what it would look like if Mattel spun out its new Barbie EV division and merged it with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Crypto collective raises $27 million to bid for rare copy of US Constitution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PYuihaWk4jmpFd8X4Sfp8pEkrBc=/0x0:1746x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157078/constdao.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of 13 remaining copies of the Official Edition of the Constitution. | Image: Sotheby’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b8MqSn"&gt;Say you want to buy an early printing of the US Constitution, but you’ve only got a couple of bucks. Normally, you’d be out of luck, but maybe not today: over the last week, &lt;a href="https://www.constitutiondao.com/"&gt;a collective has formed&lt;/a&gt; to raise enough money to buy a rare early printing of the Constitution at auction, raising money from anyone who wants to chip in online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMKFPt"&gt;The document is expected to sell at Sotheby’s for as high as $20 million — what would seem to be an insurmountable price for a crowdfunding initiative. And yet, somehow, the collective has raised $27 million to date. And they still have more than 24 hours to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PC76UY"&gt;There’s a lot going on here, so I’m just going to break it down piece by piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9fGVy9"&gt;The document being purchased is one of 13 remaining copies of the Official Edition of the Constitution, a final draft created for the Continental Congress, &lt;a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/the-constitution-of-the-united-states"&gt;according to Sotheby’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UrGPr2"&gt;The group raising money to buy the copy is called the ConstitutionDAO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9nDews"&gt;DAO stands for “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/17/11965192/ethereum-theft-dao-cryptocurrency-million-stolen-bitcoin"&gt;decentralized autonomous organization&lt;/a&gt;.” A lot of these have been popping up lately in the crypto space, usually with specific goals, like selling merch or... buying a copy of the US Constitution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W9MdgH"&gt;DAOs are basically worker coops for crypto nerds. It’s a kind of decentralized corporation with all the rules inscribed into smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, so all the sensitive corporate functions happen in a decentralized and automatic way. In practice, it’s a way to raise a lot of money really fast for some kind of capital-intensive collective endeavor like buying a copy of the Constitution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1SbxBC"&gt;Separately, we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks"&gt;more and more instances of people collectively pooling finances online&lt;/a&gt; in ways that have real-world impact but are also basically silly: see the whole GameStonk thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NEJOtr"&gt;ConstitutionDAO had been picking up speed in recent days, but it really exploded this afternoon after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/business/crypto-constitution-sothebys.html"&gt;being featured in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, raising more than $10 million today alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9ULwO7"&gt;Because it’s a DAO, all of the money is being raised in Ether. Then, to track who gets a say in the organization, contributors will get governance tokens, giving them the ability to vote on what becomes of the document (should they successfully buy it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RP9wfG"&gt;If ConstitutionDAO wins the auction, they intend to find a partner organization that will publicly display it, ideally for free to visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ehajgj"&gt;If they lose, money will be sent back to contributors, minus fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="i2DllW"&gt;The auction is being held on Thursday at 6:30PM ET. Good luck to whoever is bidding against the collective will of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HaptX says Meta copied its patented design for haptic glove</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Reality Labs haptic glove" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PWf9YWpYpinN-0C3hP8usR7ImJs=/0x2:2000x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157001/RL___Haptic_Glove_1scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rveZ5m"&gt;Haptics company HaptX claims Meta (formerly Facebook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaptX/status/1460754319553163264"&gt;copied its patented designs&lt;/a&gt; in a glove that the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22782860/meta-facebook-reality-labs-soft-robotics-haptic-glove-prototype"&gt;revealed yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. HaptX — a longtime player in the virtual and augmented reality industry — says parts of the glove appear “substantively identical” to its own work using pneumatics to simulate physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btwi0x"&gt;“We welcome interest and competition in the field of microfluidic haptics; however, competition must be fair for the industry to thrive,” said HaptX founder and CEO Jake Rubin in a statement. “While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JwSS4u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our statement on Meta's microfluidic glove prototype &lt;a href="https://t.co/v4G5LqkHsY"&gt;https://t.co/v4G5LqkHsY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q33BQ5D6jF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q33BQ5D6jF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HaptX (@HaptX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaptX/status/1460754319553163264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rC0sjD"&gt;The Meta glove is an in-progress design that won’t be commercialized for years, if ever. However, Meta Reality Labs — a VR- and AR-focused research division — believes touch is a vital piece of future consumer-focused VR / AR systems. The glove uses inflatable rubber pads and a sophisticated control system to create a sensation of pressure or resistance when users touch virtual objects. HaptX developed a similar &lt;a href="https://haptx.com/technology/"&gt;inflation-based system&lt;/a&gt; that it sells to professional clients rather than consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFZGB5"&gt;HaptX, formerly known as AxonVR, &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/axonvr-making-haptic-exoskeleton-suit-bring-body-mind-vr/"&gt;debuted publicly in 2016&lt;/a&gt; after four years in stealth mode. Meta researchers say they developed their first glove prototype in mid-2015, not long after the tech giant acquired VR startup Oculus. However, Meta has substantially expanded on its initial prototype, and HaptX claims the two companies have had extended interactions. “Over the years, we’ve hosted many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta to demonstrate our groundbreaking haptic technology,” said Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU0SMX"&gt;Meta has been accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;unfairly competing against VR software developers&lt;/a&gt; by cloning their products while limiting access to the Quest platform. This situation is slightly different because HaptX is accusing Meta of direct patent infringement — something that could potentially lead to legal action. Reached for comment, HaptX declined to comment on what it would consider a fair agreement with Meta, as well as whether it might pursue a lawsuit if it fails to reach one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2mnnh"&gt;A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram to shut down Threads as Meta consolidates its messaging platforms</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9lYCD"&gt;Instagram’s standalone messaging service Threads will cease to exist by the end of 2021, Meta has confirmed to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The app will display a notice prompting users to return to Instagram starting November 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUlsgT"&gt;Threads was a similar idea to Facebook Messenger — it allowed users to send and receive Instagram DMs in a dedicated messaging interface outside of the main app. It had a collection of quirky features, including automatic statuses that the app could set for you based on what your phone was doing. All of those tools will be available in Instagram itself by the time Threads shuts down, the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y7XiNU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re bringing the fun and unique features we had on Threads to the main Instagram app.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="59fwRh"&gt;Meta is also in the process of consolidating its many messaging platforms. Messenger and Instagram now both support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495068/facebook-messenger-instagram-cross-platform-messaging-integration"&gt;cross-platform messaging&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has said it intends to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197228/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-merge-messaging-services-mark-zuckerberg"&gt;incorporate WhatsApp as well&lt;/a&gt;. Threads — an app solely connected to Instagram — may make less sense the more the lines blur between Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEBcEu"&gt;But it’s also the case that not a heck of a lot of people were using Threads to begin with. The app had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506712/instagram-threads-app-update-close-friends-direct-messaging"&gt;just over 200,000 users&lt;/a&gt; as of last year, which is a tiny percentage of Instagram’s billion-plus user base. Meta tried a number of things last year — it redesigned the app entirely and expanded its use cases from just the close friends list to all users — but it seems they weren’t enough to save it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yt0wlo"&gt;Reached for comment, Instagram spokesperson Christine Pai provided the following statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We know that people care about connecting with their close friends, and we’ve seen this particularly over the past few years with the growth of messaging on Instagram.” Pai added, “We’re now focusing our efforts on enhancing how you connect with close friends on Instagram, and depracating the Threads app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOXaf9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 17th, 4:36M ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
