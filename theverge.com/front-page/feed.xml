    <title>Microsoft opens its Windows store up to third-party app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H43JqyzG4OHA3qRCJC51mKUQnwM=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920541/Store_Home_Standalone_1_1600x900.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Microsoft Store in Windows 11 will also support third-party app stores.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nh0Sbm"&gt;Microsoft is opening up its own app store in Windows even further today, inviting third-party app stores to integrate into the Microsoft Store. It’s a significant change that will see both Amazon and Epic Games Store discoverable in the Microsoft Store in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RePDd3"&gt;“Just like any other app, third-party storefront apps will have a product detail page — which can be found via search or by browsing — so that users can easily find and install it with the same confidence as any other app in the Microsoft Store on Windows,” explains Giorgio Sardo, general manager of the Microsoft Store. “Today, we are sharing that Amazon and Epic Games will bring their storefront apps to the Microsoft Store over the next few months, and we look forward to welcoming other stores as well in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mubmpQ"&gt;The news comes months after Microsoft announced some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;major changes to the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is the store being overhauled for Windows 11 and eventually Windows 10, but Microsoft will also let developers keep 100 percent of the revenue from apps if they use alternative payment platforms. The only exception is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;this doesn’t apply to games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNdcomXi_a9HPtsWLh3hiRPZtWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690995/store.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Microsoft Store in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eO1glQ"&gt;It also comes after head of Windows and devices, Panos Panay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550103/microsoft-new-windows-app-store-steam-welcome"&gt;revealed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in June that Microsoft is open to Steam and other third-party stores being part of its new Windows 11 app store. “I really want this experience where you go to the store, you type the app in, and you get the app you want,” said Panay earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbU7Nl"&gt;While Steam isn’t on the list just yet, it could still arrive in the future. Microsoft’s commitment to being an “open Store for an open platform” will now allow for any third-party storefront apps to be listed in the Microsoft Store on Windows. That doesn’t mean separate apps and games from rival stores will be discoverable and installable, but the storefront apps will be listed in search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAulha"&gt;The only difference here is with Microsoft’s partnership with Amazon. Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11, and that includes the ability to discover and search the Amazon Appstore directly from within the Microsoft Store. A preview of this integration will be available for Windows Insiders soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5Guxh"&gt;Microsoft’s more open app store policies have already had a big impact on the Microsoft Store. Popular apps like Discord, Zoom, VLC, TeamViewer, and Visual Studio Code are all now listed in the Microsoft Store. There are even Progressive Web Apps (PWA) from Reddit, Wikipedia, TikTok, Tumblr, and more. Any browser can now be listed in the Microsoft Store, too, and both Opera and Yandex Browser have taken advantage of Microsoft’s new policies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla sued by Texas cops after a Model X on Autopilot slammed into five officers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-U1QSMc6JndIuSCRXqHIKbNP9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920538/tesla-model-x-launch-019-2040.0.0.1444151295.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZB9GfH"&gt;A group of Texas law enforcement officials are suing Tesla after a Model X with Autopilot engaged crashed into five police officers. The suit was &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/09/27/lawsuit-filed-against-tesla-after-accident-that-injured-5-police-officers/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=snd&amp;amp;utm_content=kprc2"&gt;first reported by KPRC 2 in Houston&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZAhJr"&gt;It is the latest legal headache for the automaker as it seeks to roll out its controversial driver assistance software to more customers. And it comes as Tesla is facing renewed scrutiny over several crashes that have taken place involving Autopilot and emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2KY91"&gt;The crash took place February 27, 2021, in Splendora, a small town in Montgomery County in the eastern part of the state. &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21069638/lawsuit-filed-against-tesla-and-pappas-restaurants.pdf"&gt;According to the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, the Model X SUV crashed into several police officers while they were engaged in a traffic stop on the Eastex Freeway in Texas. “All were badly injured,” the lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OSdJG"&gt;The plaintiffs claim that “design and manufacturing defects known to Tesla” are responsible for the crash, as well as “Tesla’s unwillingness to admit or correct such defects.” Autopilot, they argue, “failed to detect the officers’ cars or to function in any way to avoid or warn of the hazard and subsequent crash.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1PRcS"&gt;The plaintiffs also note that “this was not an isolated instance,” citing “at least” 12 other crashes that have occurred involving a Tesla vehicle using Autopilot. Incidentally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota"&gt;investigating 12 crashes&lt;/a&gt; in which Tesla owners using the company’s Autopilot features have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles, resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iodIWe"&gt;The lawsuit cites several tweets by Tesla CEO Elon Musk commenting on crashes involving Autopilot or incidents of Tesla owners misusing the system as evidence that the company is aware of these defects and has failed to recall or correct them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FR36Vj"&gt;Tesla’s blatant refusal to adopt additional safeguards or to fix the issues with its Autopilot system demonstrate a lack of supervision and oversight of Tesla’s Autopilot system. Tesla has intentionally decided not to remedy these issues and must be held liable and accountable, especially when it has detailed knowledge of the risks and dangers associated with its Autopilot system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jyFctJ"&gt;The officers are also suing a local restaurant owner, claiming the driver of the Model X was served too much alcohol prior to the incident. They are seeking damages for injuries and permanent disabilities. The lawsuit lists damages in excess of $1,000,000, with maximum damages of $20,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNDLEC"&gt;Tesla has been hit with lawsuits regarding crashes involving Autopilot in the past. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750715/tesla-autopilot-crash-lawsuit-wrongful-death"&gt;Tesla was sued by the family of Jeremy Banner&lt;/a&gt;, a 50-year-old man who died in a crash while using Autopilot. Earlier that year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525330/tesla-autopilot-lawsuit-model-x-crash-walter-huang"&gt;the company was sued by the family of 38-year-old Wei Huang&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 2018 after his Model X crashed into an off-ramp divider with Autopilot engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOwDxT"&gt;Last week, Tesla enabled access to the beta of its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) program to more customers via a “request” button on Teslas’ dashboard screens. FSD is marketed as a more advanced version of Autopilot that enables drivers to use its features, like steering control and adaptive cruise control, on local roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpdGjv"&gt;Safety officials have criticized the rollout. Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;said last week&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla should address “basic safety issues” before expanding FSD, calling the company’s use of the term full self-driving “misleading and irresponsible.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ new trailer shows what you’ll be doing outside of battle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bf-6CCGlerMnxKLIdGffglY16Ck=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920197/Legends_Arceus___Screenshot_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3jzFV8"&gt;We already know that the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630388/pokemon-legends-arceus-nintendo-switch-battle-system-trailer"&gt;makes some big changes when it comes to combat and capturing monsters&lt;/a&gt;. But the latest trailer for the roleplaying game shows some of the other things you’ll be doing. That includes familiar elements like riding pokémon, customizing your trainer with clothes and hairstyles, and what looks like a fairly robust photo mode. The trailer also ends with a look at a brand-new monster called Kleavor. Additionally, the developers revealed that players will get a device called an Arc Phone, which will likely serve as a pokédex of sorts. It also looks suspiciously like the titular new Arceus pokémon being introduced in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/560-cHwEv5o4DrQSJnjWLcdZTy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884486/Legends_Arceus___Phone_Artwork.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENg88jfa_832xK3jegR5geCmWes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884485/Arceus_Glow.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btWMuV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454614/pokemon-legends-arceus-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt; isn’t launching until next January&lt;/a&gt;, but there is another &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; title a little closer on the horizon, with remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt; coming to the Switch on November 19th. That game also has a new trailer that you can check out below, which similarly gets into the nitty-gritty of how the game works. That includes details on the Pokétch, a handy, app-filled gadget players can utilize; as well as Amity Square, a location where players can relax and have a photoshoot with their favorite monsters. The trailer is also a good chance to acquaint yourself with the games’ new, chibi art style that stands in contrast to the more grounded look of &lt;em&gt;Arceus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Artificial intelligence might eventually write this article</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIQhXlq9rZgtNdnul-XCptrl6WE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920192/VRG_ILLO_3180_AI_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FfG5F"&gt;I hope my headline is an overstatement, purely for job purposes, but in this week’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; artificial intelligence episode, we explore the world of large language models and how they might be used to produce AI-generated text in the future. Maybe it’ll give writers ideas for the next major franchise series, or write full blog posts, or, at the very least, fill up websites with copy that’s too arduous for humans to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTTFFo"&gt;Among the people we speak to is Nick Walton, the cofounder and CEO of Latitude, which makes the game AI Dungeon, which creates a plot in the game around what you put into it. (That’s how Walton ended up in a band of traveling goblins — you’ll just have to listen to understand how that makes sense!) We also chat with Samanyou Garg, founder of Writesonic, a company that offers various writing tools powered by AI. The company can even have AI write a blog post — I’m shaking! But really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HuYUMy"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7518306588&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sAhs8A"&gt;Anyway, toward the end of the episode, I chat with James Vincent, The Verge’s AI and machine learning senior reporter, who calms me down and helps me understand what the future of text-generation AI might be. He’s great. Check out the episode above, and make sure you subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; feed for one more episode of this AI miniseries, as well as the regular show. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota’s autonomous division just bought the company that made a self-driving DeLorean do donuts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ss07tFJqDxMGaVmFLCvN7sZqKvQ=/6x0:1395x926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920041/1_WvaNRYj4C7k_diYdW2VOSQ.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I57IOo"&gt;Woven Planet Holdings, a subsidiary of Toyota, acquired Renovo Motors, a startup that makes operating systems for autonomous vehicles. It’s the latest acquisition that aims to accelerate Toyota’s mission to develop autonomous vehicles with connected software. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITonB5"&gt;Toyota established &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21052324/toyota-woven-city-japan-bjarke-ingels-ces-2020"&gt;Woven Planet&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021 to invest in and develop mobility with artificial intelligence. Since then, the company has been on a shopping spree, acquiring Carmera, a firm that provides real-time, high-definition maps and data for driverless vehicles, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;Lyft’s Level 5 autonomous vehicle division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wqmg1m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renovo converted a DeLorean with an electric powertrain and then did autonomous d&lt;s&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s&gt;onuts with it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NiPbtl"&gt;Renovo, which is based in Silicon Valley, makes operating systems that integrate all the software needed to run fleets of autonomous vehicles. Founded by Chris Heiser and Jason Stinson in 2010, Renovo has been involved in a number of interesting automotive projects over the years. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/9/7517291/renovo-coupe-electric-supercar-ces-2015"&gt;Renovo Coupe&lt;/a&gt;, a $529,000 electric supercar with 1,000 pound-feet of torque and a 0–60 time of 3.4 seconds, or its project to convert a DeLorean with an electric powertrain and then do &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2015/10/21/renovo-motors-and-stanford-built-an-electric-delorean-that-can-autonomously-do-donuts-video/"&gt;autonomous donuts with it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbUw1u"&gt;More recently, Renovo built an AV system that monitors not only driver attention but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17233614/renovo-affectiva-self-driving-car-driver-monitoring-emotion"&gt;passenger and pedestrian facial expressions for a better understanding of their emotions&lt;/a&gt; inside and outside the vehicle. The company worked with an AI startup called Affectiva to integrate this technology into its fleet of test vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ktVby"&gt;Renovo aspired to be the Amazon Web Services of self-driving cars. Its operating system, called AWare, enables autonomous vehicles to handle enormous amounts of sensor data. Renovo has also worked &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/12/samsung-renovo-self-driving-cars/"&gt;with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; to help test, develop, and deploy the smartphone giant’s self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUsfyO"&gt;“This is a really, really big day for us,” Heiser &lt;a href="https://medium.com/renovo-auto-blog/renovos-next-big-step-894ca2dbdade"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the acquisition by Toyota. “When Jason Stinson and I co-founded Renovo in 2010, we dreamed of a world where cars would be defined by their software platforms and, in doing so, unlock a world of new experiences and re-define the very nature of transportation. It is a vision that requires a complete re-think of the car to its core. This dream, in powerful alignment with Woven Planet’s vision and mission, now takes an even bigger step towards reality.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck took me to the top of the mountain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qv4QY4UNgDpUCjfbuE8ZJ3jsGTQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919698/mclark_210923_4776_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Car of the wild&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="J7Ofcc"&gt;Not everyone who buys Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck will drive it over basketball-sized rocks two miles above sea level. But that experience can be had on the North Fork Swan River trail in Breckenridge, Colorado, which is where the buzzy Amazon and Ford-backed startup gave &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and other media outlets one of the first chances to experience the R1T — a sleek, $67,500 luxury four-by-four for affluent-but-still-outdoorsy types that is finally shipping to customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;after multiple delays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1fdwX"&gt;For those casually keeping up with the boom in electric vehicles, the R1T may ring a bell: it’s the truck that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;announced to much fanfare at the 2018 LA Auto Show&lt;/a&gt; by Rivian, which had previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe"&gt;been operating in stealth mode&lt;/a&gt; since 2009. The company has since pounced on the excitement and anticipation for its “electric adventure vehicles” (which include the pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;and an SUV&lt;/a&gt;) and turned it into major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035192/rivian-funding-1-3-billion-t-rowe-price-amazon-ford"&gt;financial backing from Ford&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon, including a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;create a fleet of delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; for the e-commerce giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0iYm0"&gt;Two days with the R1T isn’t enough to say if this incredible effort will succeed or fail, but a whirlwind adventure up into the mountains with the first EV pickup to market did give me the sense that Rivian is aiming for a very specific type of person, and that it has a very clear (and opinionated) picture of what this new type of electric vehicle should be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWNaFg"&gt;While the trail took up the majority of driving time, I’ll start with what it was like to drive the R1T on paved roads since that’s where most trucks are driven. I got to experience a wide range of conditions, from zooming up winding mountain passes to sitting in slow-moving construction traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HPjP6g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flooring the R1T’s accelerator is a lot of fun&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epw7TL"&gt;Rivian’s truck weighs around 6,000 pounds but is faster and more nimble than any car I’ve driven. The R1T has four motors — one for each wheel — that can easily pin your head to the headrest if you really floor it. It’s a lot of fun (even for someone like me who’s been accused of driving like a grandma), but it also serves a practical purpose; it’s a breeze to shoot up on-ramps or pass combustion-powered cars on the highway. That’s extra true in the Colorado mountains, where ICE cars can be starved for air due to the elevation. I’d press the Rivian’s pedal and just take off, all without the roar of an engine — or the 3-second delay I’m used to as my 2008 Subaru Outback puzzles over what gear it should be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tgXrPj"&gt;It’s also comfortable and simple, without being spartan like a Honda Element or old Jeep Wrangler. The R1T’s interior makes heavy use of an easy-to-clean (according to Rivian) vegan leather that feels like the real deal. The instrument cluster shows you all the most relevant information, like speed, drive mode, location, and range, but manages to not be distracting while you’re actually driving. Even the 16-inch center screen didn't get in the way of paying attention to the road, and the lack of physical controls left plenty of room for storage space, including a large mat where you can throw something like a camera or your keys and a gull-winged center console compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GoC9zz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The interior is simple, but in a luxurious way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Center consoles are usually not worth geeking out about, but this one was. The space in front of it also acts as a wireless charging pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0PUxYZ"&gt;It’s easy to imagine having a blast road-tripping in the R1T. The seats, including the back row, are comfortable, and you won’t have to worry about access to power for phones and computers. The truck is packed with USB-C and 12V ports and even has a few standard 120V outlets (Rivian hasn’t really said whether the truck will be able to power a whole house in an emergency situation, a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;Ford says the F-150 Lightning will have&lt;/a&gt;). Plus, there’s tons of dry and lockable storage, from the frunk and gear tunnel to a cubby underneath the rear seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSRRvg"&gt;Oh yes, the gear tunnel: it’s a compartment that spans the width of the truck, where you can throw your bags, skis, and paddles (or really anything else you can think of). It’s big enough for a human to squeeze into — an opportunity that I just couldn’t pass up. You can also access at least some of it from a hatch in the back seat of the R1T’s cab.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paint me like one of your frunk girls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rU4Yuj"&gt;The truck also comes with adaptive cruise control, which can make long drives and stop-and-go traffic more bearable, and a suite of driver assistance features called Driver Plus. On pre-mapped stretches of highway, the truck can take over steering duties, keeping you in the center of the lane and even attempting to follow curves. In my (very brief) testing, it handled fine going around curves, but a message did pop up on the screen warning me that I could have to take over at any time. It does, however, still require that you keep your hands on the wheel. If it has to warn you three times to pay attention, Driver Plus mode will turn off, and you won’t be able to turn it on again until you put the truck in park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYUL3d"&gt;The weight of the R1T’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/rivians-electric-r1t-pickup-truck-r1s-suv-get-their-official-epa-ranges/"&gt;135kWh battery pack&lt;/a&gt; is spread out along the entire length of the truck, helping it avoid some traditional truck problems. I didn’t experience any of the fishtails that I used to deal with when I owned a Chevy S10 or when I drove a mid-2000s Ford Ranger. That weight also keeps the Rivian planted when going into curves, without the body roll that sometimes comes with bigger cars. Despite the R1T’s quickness and high-tech features, it still drives like a truck. The high carriage means you ride pretty high up, and you have to be aware of the amount of space you’re taking up on the road. While the R1T is no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522959/cadillac-escalade-2021-first-drive-safety-oversized"&gt;Escalade&lt;/a&gt; or Tundra, it still towers over all but the largest sedans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVbd4J"&gt;Like it or not, the R1T will probably become the standard point of comparison when it comes to talking about electric trucks because it’s the first one to make its way into customers’ hands. That doesn’t mean that it won’t have to compete against trucks from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;, but it does mean that its concept of an EV truck being something for well-to-do outdoor enthusiasts is probably going to be one that sticks in the minds of consumers. If an electric truck comes out that can’t do 0-60 in close to three seconds, that’ll almost certainly get brought up in reviews because the R1T can do it. Up until this point, the experience and characteristics of an EV with a truck bed have mostly been theoretical, which made expectations more fluid. After driving the R1T, though, I can say it was exactly what I imagined an electric truck feeling like given what I know about EV cars and regular trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8jyD2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The R1T is first, which likely means upcoming electric trucks will be compared to it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSk1It"&gt;Unfortunately, the one thing I have to keep imagining is the charging experience, as I never got to plug in the truck. Rivian’s excuse for this was that trips to a gas station wouldn’t be part of a press drive of a new gas car. I would (and did) argue that if you were driving a gas car for three days you probably &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; fill its tank at some point, but as far as I’m aware none of us got to experience charging the car outside of the handful of miles we gained from regenerative braking. Each night, Rivian whisked the trucks away to be cleaned and charged up for the next day’s adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fXC48O"&gt;All I can speak to is what it’s like to open and close the door to the standard CCS1 charging port. Like the hood, gear tunnel doors, and tailgate, it can be opened either with a physical button, or using the touchscreen. (The hood and charge port door can be closed using the touchscreen as well.) Rivian also told me that if you start driving with the charge door open, it’ll close automatically. That feels like an incredible luxury to me. I always forget to close the charging door on my plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rivian’s air suspension going from low to high, sped up four times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CqDdLc"&gt;Since Rivian charged the trucks for us overnight, I never had any range anxiety with the R1T, even while we were off-roading. Our test model was capable of going 314 miles on a full charge, but I don’t think I ever saw it dip below 90 miles, even after a full day of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq2jok"&gt;Beyond offering ample range, Rivian is accommodating adventurous drivers with five drive modes, which you can freely switch between: there’s All Purpose for paved and dirt road driving, Off-Road for when things get rocky, Sport if you’re looking for speed, and the aptly named Conserve and Towing modes. The Off-Road mode also has profiles like rock crawl, rally, and auto that change various things, like the ride height (which can go from 7.9 inches to 14.4 inches using the air suspension), braking behavior, suspension stiffness, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeSF9W"&gt;In 2019, Rivian announced that the truck would have &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzwM8KE2L3I"&gt;a “tank turn” feature&lt;/a&gt;, letting it basically do donuts while staying in one place. That feature &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/why-rivian-tank-turn-stationary-spin-feature-is-delayed/"&gt;has since been delayed&lt;/a&gt;, so I didn’t get to try it out (a shame, as it would’ve helped me avoid a four point turnaround).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4a9D9"&gt;I’m the type of person that Rivian seems to be targeting with it’s adventure-focused marketing; I spend almost every weekend hiking, biking, or kayaking when I can. So I was extremely excited when I was told that we’d be doing some “serious off-roading.” I did also wonder how serious it would really be — this was a press event after all, would Rivian really be throwing us at hardcore trails, potentially risking their trucks? (Not that losing a truck would be devastating to a company that’s raised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;$10 billion dollars in funding&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfeS0i"&gt;Apparently, yes. I don’t want to pretend like we were doing hardcore rock crawling, but we certainly got to see how the truck handled steep, loose climbs, water crossings, and situations where we were driving at an extreme angle over very uneven ground (though I don’t think we ever lifted more than one wheel off the ground). And the R1T handled all those things beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="VYWiH7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian calls the R1T an electric adventure vehicle — so how was it at adventuring?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5jRyX"&gt;Something that I thought a lot throughout the day was “this feels like it should require skill.” Instead of worrying about keeping the engine at the right RPM so I’d have enough torque to clear the next obstacle, I just pressed the accelerator and we went forward. There were many times that, had I been driving a gas truck, I likely would’ve had to back up to get a little momentum going, which I never had to do in the R1T. The Rivian was tall enough that it could drive over most of the rocks we encountered — and that was in its “high” ride height setting of 13.1 inches, not even the “max” setting of 14.4 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking back at the trail we drove to get to one of the summits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yrwK2E"&gt;With that said, there were moments that I (a person who only occasionally off-roads) was nervous: some of the aforementioned intense angles left me gripping the &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oh%20shit%20handle"&gt;colloquially named “oh shit” handles&lt;/a&gt;, which backseat passengers also have access to, and did their job well. Also, I always hate it when the sky’s the only thing you can see out of the windshield. But the truck never felt like &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; was breaking a sweat, especially when going downhill — I just kept my foot off the pedal and let the regen braking keep me at around 4mph. It was much easier than the engine braking I’m used to, where you have to decide between going 10 in second gear, and 35 in third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbUlRs"&gt;One of the quietly impressive moments for me was near the beginning of the trail; it was relatively steep and, as I discovered, absolutely iced out. We stopped the truck to switch drivers, and when I got out to let the other journalist I was driving with take the wheel, I found out just how slippery the trail was in a hilarious fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkDFQ6f7Hfog4HlWSdYi_UvriFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883381/Fall_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually when driving you worry about black ice, not mud-colored ice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z6myAt"&gt;I thought that, since we were starting from a dead stop on an intense grade, the R1T’s front wheels would at least slip on the ice a bit before it found its footing, much like I did (especially since a Rivian engineer told me that it sends more power to the front wheels than the rear in rock crawling mode). Instead, it just drove right over the slippery surface like it wasn’t there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtw6TU"&gt;Of course, the truck isn’t magic, and there is still some level of skill required if you’re going to be doing difficult trails. We managed to rip a hole in the sidewall of our tire, and had to do a very dusty spare swap. Thankfully, the truck is able to hold a full-size spare, tucked away in the bed (adding one is an $800 option for the 20-inch all-terrain tires we were using during the test drive), so we were able to get right back to driving pretty quickly. Apparently the rock we hit was problematic; the Rivian folks said they’d gotten flats there before with a previous group. There was also a reasonably technical climb where we had a spotter helping us out, because the front and side facing cameras the truck is equipped with could only do so much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The R1T’s suite of cameras can help you see upcoming obstacles, and get a feel for where your sidewalls are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cscrZO"&gt;The R1T can handle unpaved terrain, but Rivian also says it wants the truck to look at home in the woods. I’m not really the right person to say whether it achieves that or not — in my opinion new and shiny things look out of place in nature (honestly, anything made by humans is stretching it). I think it fits in with nature far better than, say, the stainless-steel, trapezoidal Cybertruck, though the mountain goats we saw on the journey didn’t seem to love seeing six or seven Rivians in a row, as they quickly made themselves scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Km5un0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10777177"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agXBM5"&gt;Like Patagonia (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;a comparison Rivian’s CEO has made before&lt;/a&gt;), I can see the R1T’s design and driving experience appealing both to those who prefer the city and to people who are only slightly joking by &lt;a href="https://sectionhiker.com/what-is-hiker-trash/"&gt;calling themselves hiker trash&lt;/a&gt;. Though it’s certainly not going to be a vehicle designed for those looking to adventure on a budget given its starting price of $67,500. Even factoring in the &lt;a href="https://rivian.com/support/article/are-rivian-vehicles-eligible-for-the-federal-tax-credit"&gt;possible $7,500 federal EV tax credit&lt;/a&gt;, that’s an expensive vehicle for most people, especially those who are more interested in spending time outdoors than being traditionally employed. Higher-end gas trucks can reach similar prices, but you can get into them much cheaper: Ford recently announced it’s Maverick pickup truck, which is significantly less luxurious than the R1T, but also comes with a hybrid drivetrain and starts at around $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjHxSs"&gt;There are a few nitpicks I had with the R1T. The lack of CarPlay or Android Auto is a bummer, though it would be somewhat mitigated by the truck’s built-in navigation and Spotify app. The build-it-yourself approach has worked for Tesla, so Rivian could be fine if it really nails the UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Da99vg_8ezKUW5LV4izyD1Ul6A4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883385/AC_vents.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a lot of fun watching the vents move, but I wish I could just do it manually.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="APhsno"&gt;Some heating and cooling buttons would also be much appreciated though. As it stands, the climate controls live solely in software. The screen is also not laggy, per se, but it could be more responsive. It’s worth noting, though, that it was running pre-production software, and that Rivian can always make improvements with over-the-air updates. Rivian will have to hurry on those updates if they want them done before trucks start making their way to customers, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RJScaringe/status/1437842808384233477?s=20"&gt;production R1Ts are currently being built&lt;/a&gt;. A Rivian representative told me that the truck’s computer has “supercomputer” levels of power, which wasn’t evident through the UI (like it is with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;Tesla’s ability to play AAA games&lt;/a&gt;), though the Driver Plus system likely pushes the hardware harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVTAyB"&gt;I also found that the lack of a traditional step-up truck bumper made it a bit difficult to just jump up into the bed and grab something, though when I mentioned this to a Rivian employee they said that they’d been using the gear tunnel door for that purpose. While that definitely works, having to open the door and then close it again is a bit more of a pain than just grabbing onto the tailgate and hoisting yourself up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHt0KO"&gt;So, after going on what was basically the best test drive ever, who do I think the R1T is for? It seems like a good choice for those who like to go off-roading, as my experience shows that it’s capable of some pretty extreme stuff. That’ll also make it a good choice for campers, especially those who take less-traveled roads to get to wherever they’re staying. Rivian obviously has those folks in mind — the truck’s storage is good for those who like to bring &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98lM4S77_d4"&gt;a lot of luxury items with them to the outdoors&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has even teamed up with Yakima to create a rooftop tent for the R1T. Plus, with the R1T being a truck, it’ll be good for those who just want a bed for hauling oversized items, bikes, or things that would be a lot of work to clean out of a car like potting soil or Christmas trees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiLzWv0-GL2L_7FrbZNQpWpTbX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883412/Screen_Shot_2021_09_27_at_3.54.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rivian says the gooseneck hinge allows for the 4.5-foot long bed to be expanded to 83.6 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rl2aX9"&gt;As for those who constantly tow things, the R1T might be a mixed bag. While it’s rated for 11,000 pounds, Rivian says that actually pulling that much weight will cut your range in half. Even with the $10,000 max battery pack option, which Rivian predicts will get you “400 plus” miles, that’s not a ton of range. The truck may not be a great fit if you often carry long objects, like tandem kayaks or construction materials; with the tailgate closed, you’re only looking at a 4.5-foot bed, and even the clever tailgate extension mechanism only gets you 7 feet of floor space. And, again, there will probably be a lot of people that the R1T appeals to who simply can’t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nIY62"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I don’t think the bed is big enough for kayaks, and putting one on a rack defeats the purpose of having a truck.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fFfdz5"&gt;It may not be a great option for people yearning for the small trucks of yesteryear either, as many of my family and friends do. I got to talk to the Rivian’s CEO, RJ Scaringe, at a campfire-side dinner, and after getting our introductions out of the way I told him about my clan’s pleas for a single-cab, 6-foot bed truck. He basically told me that he heard me, but that the company is currently trying to make things that appeal to a lot of people. He told me the same thing when I asked about whether the truck could be towed flat behind something like an RV — the current model can’t, but it’d be possible to make one. It would just depend on whether there were enough people interested in that sort of thing to make it worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JO0AAG"&gt;Speaking of that dinner, all the meals we ate were cooked on the $5,000 camp stove that stows away in the gear tunnel, (which does mean you’re down one storage compartment). The camp stove is fancier than the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-2000020943NP-Classic-Propane-Stove/dp/B00005OU9D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;classic green Coleman stove&lt;/a&gt;: it gets electricity from sockets built into the sled that it rolls out on, and uses induction burners instead of gas. It also comes with a set of Snow Peak dishes, silverware, cookware, and coffee gear. While I didn’t get to cook on it, I can say that Rivian’s chefs were able to make some pretty great food using the system, though I’d chalk a lot of that up to their skill rather than equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DoVz1P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10777197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qTeyK"&gt;Despite that, Rivian may struggle to get traction with truck enthusiasts. It’s a market with a lot of brand loyalty (there’s a class of truck owners who are so proud of their chosen brand that they &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FORD-Well-least-circled-problem/dp/B00QJ8EYCW/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Funny+Car+Stickers+for+Ford&amp;amp;qid=1632531504&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy bumper stickers&lt;/a&gt; making fun of anyone unlucky enough to drive something else), and the R1T doesn’t have the sort of macho-rugged looks of some of the other mid-size trucks. Despite being around the same size, it didn’t look particularly aggressive or commanding next to a two-door Tacoma, and that’ll be even more true when comparing it against, say, a lifted F-250. While those types of trucks don’t appeal to me, they’re obviously popular: dual-cab, short-bed trucks &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g36005989/best-selling-cars-2021/"&gt;are some of the top-selling vehicles in America&lt;/a&gt;, and electrification doesn’t necessarily line up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/6/22217432/trump-supporters-petro-masculinity-capitol-building"&gt;the image those vehicles project&lt;/a&gt;. The R1T is compelling to drive, but that’ll only help if people are willing to give it a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ho66cj"&gt;Rivian doesn’t think this is an insurmountable problem. Some of the folks I talked to thought the company would be able to win over people who wouldn’t have necessarily considered a truck before, and were comfortable with not capturing the entire truck market (and thus not having to convert the &lt;em&gt;hardcore truck&lt;/em&gt; people). Plus, they think some of the creature comforts could be appealing: Rivian says that the truck is designed to fit in the average American garage, something that &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2018/09/17/big-trucks-suvs-bigger-garages/1285312002/"&gt;a lot of modern trucks can’t do&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, Rivian is going after the types of people who buy Subarus and Land Rovers, rather than &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwMBT1sOtGM"&gt;Power Wagons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eo62WN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian isn’t really expecting most owners to take it on the North Fork Swan Trail — but they could if they wanted&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cQrEvH"&gt;In fact, when I pressed Rivian about whether it expected really outdoorsy people to be drawn to its trucks, the company admitted that very few R1T owners were likely to take their trucks on the type of trails we went on — though it suspected that more Rivian owners would take it on bumpy, slightly rocky dirt roads that ended up at a campsite than, say, the type of person who &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj2e_kqiN-Y"&gt;bought an H2&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian also suspects that its customers will be a self-selecting group — the people who buy Rivian’s branding and ethos will be the type of people who want to spend a lot of time outdoors, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s2AQD"&gt;I actually saw this first hand — a park ranger from White River National Forest joined our off-road group, and by the end she said she was convinced and was at least considering buying an R1T. The event, which felt like a camp (or maybe &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamping"&gt;glamp&lt;/a&gt;) getaway more than a media event, convinced me that a lot of people at Rivian loved the outdoors like I do — most of the employees I talked to had at least one hobby that involved spending time in nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gEQTm9"&gt;Now those employees have to prove that there are more people like them that are willing to buy their vehicles. That might be easier if potential customers got to have the same experience I did; every part of it, from driving on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveland_Pass"&gt;mountain pathways&lt;/a&gt;, to chatting with Rivan’s CEO around a campfire, to crawling through the truck’s gear tunnel, was certainly an adventure. But, as with most adventures, it’s hard to imagine it being my everyday life — and that’s a little how I ended up feeling about the R1T itself. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s brilliant 65-inch C1 OLED is still $300 cheaper than usual</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LG C1 OLED" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WY_z52hiqDlfEALaFr2hH9LjTl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919682/lgc1.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBaWnq"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new TV set, you’re in luck. The 65-inch version of LG’s C1 OLED is selling at an all-time low of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,797 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FLGOLED65C1PUB%2FLG-OLED65C1PUB-65-Inch-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-with-AI-ThinQ-2021-Model&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22696575%2Flg-c1-oled-hisense-u8g-tv-jabra-elite-85t-google-nest-hub-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also snag a $50 Visa gift card with your purchase. The same deal is available at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%2522-class---c1-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100761679.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; through October 10th, only your purchase comes with a three-year warranty through Allstate and a $100 streaming credit toward Google Play, Paramount Plus, Showtime, or Sling TV. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfF1fI37d73" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling this model for $1,799&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lC9VE"&gt;The lauded TV, released earlier this year, offers a slew of features gamers especially will enjoy, including support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync technologies, which help the TV resist screen tearing. It also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, low input lag, HDMI 2.1, and a Game Optimizer feature that makes it easy to access game-centric settings like latency. Of course, watching just about any kind of content will look great on an OLED, if you aren’t into gaming. Prefer a larger display? &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WGFKSMW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 77-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG3243Z/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;83-inch models&lt;/a&gt; are also on sale at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GBhrxC"&gt;At $1,800, LG’s C1 OLED TV is still pricey. Thankfully, if the OLED is out of your budget, you can also pick up Hisense’s 55-inch U8G at an all-time low. Normally $1,000, the TV is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091YJQGVW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $850&lt;/a&gt;, which is $49 less than its previous low. Released in May, the TV offers a bright QLED panel touting a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR, with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support, as well as four HDMI ports. Additionally, the 4K TV boasts support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, as well as Android TV, allowing you to quickly access Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and all of the popular streaming apps without a dedicated streaming device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22675894/hisense-100-day-no-regrets-guarantee-promotion-tv-8k-laser" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hisense is running a no-questions-asked promotion&lt;/a&gt; where you can return the TV within a 100-day window if you aren’t enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SPlYNr"&gt;A refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t — the updated version of one of our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; — are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeGetaoneyear1Passwordsubscriptionfor50percentoffAUG312021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22696575%2Flg-c1-oled-hisense-u8g-tv-jabra-elite-85t-google-nest-hub-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $100&lt;/a&gt; through Jabra’s digital storefront on eBay. The Elite 85t were among the first pair of earbuds from Jabra to ship with active noise cancellation, along with the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously, a feature high-quality earbuds like Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds and Sony’s last-gen 1000XM3 lack. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we also noted how much we enjoyed the excellent on-earbud controls and semi-open design of the Elite 85t, which we found offers a comfortable, airy fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fqWVRJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ZDWDcE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At around seven inches, it’s smaller than many other Google Assistant-enabled smart displays but offers many of the same features. It doesn’t have a camera, but the latest Nest Hub does come with new sensors to track your sleep and a display that automatically adjusts to your room’s lighting. The result, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review notes&lt;/a&gt;, is that photos look as if they’re printed on paper. What’s more, Google Photos automatically updates the display with new photos whenever you take them, making this a great digital photo frame.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM’s BrightDrop starts building its first electric vans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlRdKbwxnGa5oi5rSed3q1vVThM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919562/BrightDrop_EV600_Production_Assembly.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: BrightDrop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="onls2R"&gt;BrightDrop, which is General Motors’ new dedicated electric delivery van spinoff, has revealed its second vehicle: a smaller van with many of the same capabilities of the larger version &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt;. The new mid-size electric van comes as BrightDrop is announcing that it has already built the first production versions of the larger van, and expects to have them on the road this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nop53C"&gt;The larger van, dubbed the EV600, has 600 cubic feet of cargo space, can travel up to 250 miles on a full battery, and has a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds. The new van has a little more than 400 cubic feet of cargo space, and is so named “EV410.” The smaller van will also share the same standard safety features (like front and rear park assist, automatic emergency braking, forward collision alert, pedestrian detection and braking) as the EV600, and will have other optional safety features (like rear cross traffic braking, blind zone steering assist, rear pedestrian alert, and more).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BD0zeQl1d3JsoW24y1LryowXfOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884229/BrightDrop_EV410_Profile.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BrightDrop’s new smaller EV410 electric van.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="esTP4p"&gt;BrightDrop says Verizon has lined up to be the first customer for the EV410, and will use the van in its field maintenance and service fleet. But the smaller van won’t go into production until 2023 at a Canadian assembly plant GM is currently converting. (BrightDrop is currently outsourcing assembly of the EV600, and plans to start building that van in Canada in November 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMp9qE"&gt;Both vehicles will be built on GM’s Ultium battery platform, which will power a whole lineup of new EVs, from the Hummer SUV and pickup truck to an electric Chevy Silverado, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCQkT0"&gt;BrightDrop is not the only company making an early run at electrifying the commercial market, but it’s one of the most well-positioned thanks to the support from GM. Many other early players in the space are startups. Some, like Arrival, have raised a lot of money in the public markets and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293615/arrival-uk-electric-bus-ev-photos"&gt;are making&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417970/arrival-uber-ride-hailing-ev-electric-vehicle"&gt;big promises&lt;/a&gt;. Others, like Workhorse, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;struggled to survive&lt;/a&gt; while trying to establish themselves before the big players showed up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trouble in the Club(house)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pDl0bXZ2JKU6e3RwtyUx7sdji54=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919581/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXZMcZ"&gt;Hello, hello. Welcome to week two of &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; under &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, although I should probably count this as the first official Tuesday &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;, given that last week was all mission statement and little fun. Today, I go deeper into a story I published this morning about Clubhouse’s sponsorship woes and look over some quick news. Let’s get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1fej5H"&gt;
&lt;p id="NziCS3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Where are the sponsors? Inside Clubhouse’s creator program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJ0xkB"&gt;This morning, I published a story about Clubhouse’s Creator First program, an initiative where Clubhouse offered creators a stipend to make 12 episodes of a live audio program. As part of the deal, the platform advertised that it would match these creators with sponsors so they could turn their idea into a “profitable creative endeavor.” Spoiler: that didn’t happen. I’d encourage you to read the full story, which I’m &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22460444"&gt;linking here&lt;/a&gt;, but for this newsletter, I figured I’d pull out a couple details that feel particularly pertinent to the podcasting world. Plus, some details I couldn’t include in the story because, although the internet is infinite, I don’t want you scrolling forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca5Lz9"&gt;The biggest thing I want to point out is how similarly Clubhouse feels to early podcasting in its current monetization efforts. There’s no real ad targeting, hosts are doing host-read ads or sponsored rooms featuring brand guests, and the best way to determine sponsors’ ROI comes in the form of promo codes or affiliate links on outside platforms. Plus, as I learned in reporting this piece, Clubhouse creators aren’t receiving detailed analytics on their shows, nor are they given any demographic information about their listeners. (For its part, Clubhouse says it doesn’t collect that demographic data, so even if it wanted to share them, it couldn’t.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j17kQC"&gt;In podcasting, Apple started providing analytics — a major move — &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/12/14/16778268/apple-podcast-find-listens-downloads-analytics-available"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Spotify burst into the market with not only better analytics and massive show deals, but also the intention of making it easier to advertise on podcasts, both through targeting and more data than ever about a show’s specific listeners. We’re starting to see that podcast ad vision play out. I wonder if Twitter, Facebook, Spotify, Amazon, or any of the other countless platforms attempting live audio might beat Clubhouse to the ad targeting punch. Succeeding in the space is about good content, true — which Spotify has attempted to conquer in podcast land — but also who can help people monetize the fastest. Nothing makes someone want to create more than the incentive of getting paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlGXmh"&gt;One other theme that continued to come up in my reporting was the lack of promotion done on Clubhouse’s end. To pull a popular podcasting refrain: Clubhouse has a discovery problem. To solve for this, it primarily relied on its own team members, who have lots of followers. (When they enter a room, it populates in all their followers’ hallways, or the app’s main landing page.) This might give creators a boost, but one creator program participant tells me even that promotional tool’s power appears to be waning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skOK1F"&gt;When Stephanie Simon, Clubhouse’s head of community and content, joined Cyndi Pham’s room one time, it jumped from 60 attendees to around 600. But later that summer, the boost dropped to only 300 listeners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4hi0d"&gt;“Even the value of their mainstays were diminished over a period of three months,” she says. “When Steph jumped on a room, it would be a 10x increase, and then it became a 3x increase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79SbSK"&gt;Cross-promo, yall. It’s what everyone from podcasting has mastered — except, in Clubhouse’s case, it needs to somehow cross-promote shows you can’t listen to off-platform since there’s not yet a recording function!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V5OlR"&gt;Okay, on to the next news bit. Speaking of Spotify ads…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9uzRr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify makes a bigger push for the sponsorship $$$&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9C6JbM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-kicks-off-campaign-to-win-more-advertisers-11632736800"&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that Spotify is making a concentrated effort to court more advertising revenue. Specifically, it’s renaming its ad business to Spotify Advertising (very creative), instead of Spotify for Brands, and is looking to “attract more podcast publishers and creators to its ad marketplace, after saying earlier this year that its advertising growth has been hindered by limited inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDXj5A"&gt;I don’t know how much branding can help Spotify recruit new advertisers and podcasters, but some arm-twisting could go a long way. The article briefly mentions Streaming Ad Insertion, Spotify’s proprietary ad technology that targets podcast ads against shows streamed on Spotify and is only available through Spotify’s own hosting platform, Megaphone. Basically, if you want access to all Spotify has to offer, you have to be on a Spotify-owned property. Convenient for Spotify! The real question is whether Spotify can get local businesses to advertise through audio, along with the typical direct-to-consumer brands we love and know. Well, I guess we’ll see if the branding change-up can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kKcfx9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rG8odl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another check-in on Apple Podcasts subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QGKno"&gt;My boss Nilay Patel hosts an interview podcast called &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoder-with-nilay-patel/id1011668648?i=1000496212371"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and in today’s episode, he spoke with John Carreyrou of Theranos reporting fame. Carreyrou hosts &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt;, a show from the Three Uncanny Four that takes listeners into the trial for Theranos CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Holmes. In his chat with Nilay, Carreyrou gives us the numbers we want to know for a show that’s destined to be a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHEwgY"&gt;“I think the narrative podcast, the one that’s free, is approaching 2 million downloads, and we’ve got about 6,000 subscribers to the bonus episodes,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHChHg"&gt;Those “bonus episodes” are only available through Apple Podcasts subscriptions for $3.99 per month. You could read this as a terrible return — only 6,000 people subscribed out of the perhaps hundreds of thousands of listeners, but it’s still $24,000 per month. (Granted, these are ad-free episodes, so that’s the only revenue they generate, annnnnd they require more production and labor, but!) Given that Apple Podcasts is only one app, and subscriptions are a new thing, both in the behavior sense and as an in-app feature, I’m impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UByC5r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAA buys ICM Partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBhg66"&gt;CAA is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-27/caa-to-buy-icm-partners-in-merger-of-hollywood-talent-agencies?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt; ICM Partners, meaning the talent agency world is getting smaller. Of course, the takeaway for us here is that, presumably, some blockbuster podcasting deals will come out of this merger. Caroline Edwards is ICM’s director of podcast initiatives and has brokered deals with Spoke Media, &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Flyest Fables&lt;/em&gt;. CAA agents brokered the&lt;em&gt; SmartLess &lt;/em&gt;deal, among others, so I feel like this just helps CAA build an even stronger foothold in the podcast agency world. We love to see the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syoNOu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What in the heck is happening at Ozy Media??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uX4zYS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; media columnist Ben Smith is always a must-read for me, but this week, he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/business/media/ozy-media-goldman-sachs.html"&gt;delivered a story&lt;/a&gt; about Ozy Media’s co-founder and chief operating officer impersonating a YouTube executive to impress Goldman Sachs investors. There’s a lot happening. Ozy operates six podcasts, apparently, and has raised money from iHeart Media. I’m mostly fishing here, but if Ozy is willing to play fast and loose with &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/these-publishers-bought-millions-of-website-visits-they"&gt;fake pageviews&lt;/a&gt; and impersonation, maybe there’s more going on here in the notorious land of squishy podcast download numbers. If you want to share anything about your Ozy podcast experience, please do reach out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PrfKIO"&gt;
&lt;p id="67g6XQ"&gt;Okay, that’s all for now! As always, you can reach me at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.carman@theverge.com"&gt;ashley.carman@theverge.com&lt;/a&gt; — or even &lt;a href="mailto:ashley@hotpodmedia.com"&gt;ashley@hotpodmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;! I’m also on Twitter at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman"&gt;@ashleyrcarman&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be back on Thursday with more news and reporting for you paid folks, and if you want to see what I’m cookin’ up over there, feel free to switch to the paid tier over &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. See ya!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos announce new Symfonisk lamp speaker, coming October 12th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sPQdPvZp55JhJfo8jcA_RPd4GPk=/0x17:2040x1377/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919565/PH181497.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1tZgjJ"&gt;Today, Sonos and Ikea officially announced the second-generation Symfonisk table lamp speaker. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously reported that the product was in the pipeline, and its design, which is now more customizable and comes in different styles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666940/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-lamp-speaker-leak-swappable-lampshades"&gt;leaked earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. The new Symfonisk lamp will be available in Ikea’s US stores, US website, and “select markets in Europe” starting October 12th. It’ll expand to all of Ikea’s markets in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k4Vp9"&gt;Ikea is changing up how it’s selling the new model; this time around, the lamp base (available in black or white) is sold separately from two different styles of lampshades. You can get an opaque glass shade that’s somewhat reminiscent of the original lamp speaker — though this one is open-ended on top — but there’s also a more translucent black glass shade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GLGbcU797wcrWyYN0E_Hx0_6Xr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883863/PH179130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s now a translucent black glass lampshade in addition to the opaque white style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zt70X"&gt;The textile lampshade looks quite different from the glass design, and like the base, it also comes in black or white. There’s also expanded compatibility with lightbulbs; Ikea says the second-gen lamp “supports a broader range of light bulbs thanks to the added E26 / E27 socket.” And the controls are now on the lamp itself, as the bottom plate of the original model is no more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DE6OT"&gt;The lamp base is priced at $140; the glass lampshade is $39, and the textile shade is $29. That puts both pieces together at either $179 or $189. The original Symfonisk lamp speaker initially cost $179 when it was released and later went up by $10, so you’re essentially paying the same for gen two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8qdiMb9sdeWBnfFHurKROivrjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883871/PH181496.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The textile lampshade has a much different look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IZ2irr"&gt;Ikea and Sonos say the new lamp features a completely redesigned acoustic architecture that, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;Symfonisk wall art speaker&lt;/a&gt; I reviewed in July, uses a custom waveguide to produce sound that can blanket a whole room with music. The first-gen product had a similar sound signature to a Sonos One, so I’m curious to see what these internal changes will do in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tST1E"&gt;Like all other products in the Symfonisk series, the new lamp speaker can be used alone, but it can also be added to your multiroom Sonos system. It supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, as well. The idea behind the lineup is to blend tech with a design that more naturally fits into home décor. But the lamp speaker definitely comes down to personal taste more than something like the nondescript &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;bookshelf speaker&lt;/a&gt;, which launched alongside the original Symfonisk lamp and remains available for $99. &lt;/p&gt;
