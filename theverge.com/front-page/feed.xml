    <title>CES 2022 in-person exhibitor list continues to shrink: BMW cancels media events and Mercedes is out</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, is pressing on, but with fewer major exhibitors appearing in-person than expected due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On December 22nd, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well and despite CES organizers’ statements that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="CFpmOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel says it will move to a “digital-first” experience with minimal on-site staff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;T-Mobile was the most prominent exhibitor to bail early that week. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios’ &lt;/em&gt;Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1S9o"&gt;Hisense typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC’s central hall, but on Thursday morning, Hisense announced it decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual “to ensure the health and safety of our team.” The company still plans to have a booth at the show, with in-person walkthroughs for those attending and virtual ones for those covering it from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixYeKu"&gt;It was followed closely later in the day by Waymo, as Alphabet’s self-driving car company &lt;a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/meet-waymo-at-ces-2022.html"&gt;updated its blog post&lt;/a&gt; to explain the decision. “Based on quickly rising COVID-19 infection rates, Waymo has made the difficult decision not to participate in person at CES 2022. We are aiming to still virtually participate in some CES-related events. In particular, as part of our Self-Driven Women series, our co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana and our Global Head of Public Policy Michelle Peacock will speak at several virtual panel discussions with the Female Quotient, the official equality partner of CES 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="txgm6L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google: “we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEQ22e"&gt;Chipmaking giant Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852045/ces-2022-intel-skipping-show-covid-19'"&gt;said on Thursday afternoon&lt;/a&gt; that “[after] consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff.” Gaming accessory maker HyperX also said it’s pivoting away from in-person plans and will support conversations and activities virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GlLye"&gt;The dominoes continued to fall on Thursday, as General Motors announced its presence will be all-digital. Less than a day ago, GM confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it still planned to attend CES, where CEO Mary Barra &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712710/general-motors-investor-day-chevy-silverado-ev-2022-consumer-electronics-show"&gt;was scheduled as a keynote speaker, and it planned to debut an electric version of the Chevrolet Silverado&lt;/a&gt;, but now that has changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xr5Yi4"&gt;A statement from the company says, “We have decided to move to an all-digital approach with our activation at CES 2022 in January. CES is an important technology platform, and we are continuing with our plans on January 5 to share our significant company news including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHR3zT"&gt;GM was closely followed out the door by Google, which has frequently used CES to host larger and more extravagant showcases for its new hardware. It had planned to have a booth at the event, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1474130973923033117"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that, like its corporate sibling Waymo, it is backing out of the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyortL"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt says, “After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We’ve been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUKJbt"&gt;With just a few days left before the show begins, the list of dropouts continues to grow. AMD had previously said it was still planning to appear, but on December 28th (via &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/msi-cancels-ces-2022-attendance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) it issued the following statement: “AMD has decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES 2022 in Las Vegas and will instead transition to a virtual experience. While the AMD 2022 Product Premiere was always planned as a digital-only livestream, our in-person engagements will now transition to virtual in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, partners and communities. We look forward to sharing all our exciting news as scheduled on January 4th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsNQ3"&gt;Another late scratch is MSI. The computer maker &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Canceled-the-Physical-Presence-at-2022-CES122948"&gt;says in a post on its website&lt;/a&gt; that “Since December, the rapidly spreading Omicron variant has brought the USA a surge of COVID-19 cases. The health and well-being of our employees, customers and fans are our top priority. Hence, we have decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022 and will join the show virtually with our online product launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgEruz"&gt;OnePlus was not an official exhibitor at the show, but it says it has canceled an event that was planned to coincide with it in Las Vegas. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/more-companies-bow-out-of-in-person-ces-presence/?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, the parent company of Gillette and Oral-B, which have used CES to debut new technology, is also skipping the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quKYwk"&gt;As of Thursday, December 30th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22850502/ces-2022-exhibitors-dropping-bmw-ibm-mercedes"&gt;BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes are either entirely out or have reduced their in-person presence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5tzXmA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CES UPDATE: After closely monitoring the current trends surrounding COVID, it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and our communities to suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;— Lenovo Stories &amp;amp; News (@LenovoNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LenovoNews/status/1473824084018360321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="jLod2S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq0giq"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung, which has a featured keynote like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic, and Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend, and LG said that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that AMD (now out) and Samsung were still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus, and HTC still plan to attend. Sony and Samsung have said they are “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed (as it has already been for companies like Google and GM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On December 21st, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;The day after that, the CTA said it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykL0Nr"&gt;As far as why “CES will and must go on,” CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/"&gt;published a Christmas Day op-ed in the&lt;em&gt; Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says, among other things, “ CES 2022 will kick off 2022 in messy fashion, but it will be chock full of innovation and full of entrepreneurs and businesses. We will all be taking risks. But without risk there is no innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZhLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:09 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Amazon and LG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P8sia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information about AT&amp;amp;T, Intel, and a statement from the CTA, which organizes CES each year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVBWcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 9:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c33chn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 9:56AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Hisense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8vEK5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 2:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Waymo and Intel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xN1hMh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from GM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BIkhx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 4:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlmmdZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 28th, 5:24PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to note MSI, AMD, and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, added information from the op-ed written by CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAXUHr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 30th, 9:22AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to note BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sC9UaK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 30th, 11:03AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said BMW and Panasonic are out of CES. In fact they will both have physical booths at the show, but have changed to virtual media events. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpZH7F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says its foldable shipments increased four-fold in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0P53WWZ6Sz44CitacAYXh7fssA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330329/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k0pazt"&gt;Samsung wants you to know its foldables haven’t flopped. In a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/a-decade-in-the-making-how-samsung-foldables-are-defining-the-future-of-smartphone-innovation"&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it sold four times more foldable devices in 2021 than 2020. It attributes this success to the arrival of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, which, in our own reviews, we hailed as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;step toward mainstream usability&lt;/a&gt; thanks to their refined designs and lower prices. Samsung says sales for these two devices in their first month alone exceeded “total accumulative sales of Samsung foldable devices in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79fSs0"&gt;These are promising metrics for the slow ascension of foldable phones, though you should bear in mind that Samsung isn’t sharing hard sales data. Instead, it pointed to the fact that its increases were greater than predictions made by third-party analysts, who suggested  that total shipments from all manufacturers for foldable devices would hit &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/ko/foldable-smartphone-shipments-2023/"&gt;9 million in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbb8o4"&gt;If Samsung thinks this figure is useful enough to cite — and with the company thought to account for around 88 percent of the total foldable markets — we can guess that its sales were in the high single-digit millions or pushing into the low tens of millions. These numbers are expected to increase tenfold by 2023, with Samsung taking a smaller slice of the market as rival manufacturers like Oppo and Huawei join the foldable fun. Also predicted by some for 2023: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;foldable iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, which would really boost the segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avYseV"&gt;Samsung also says that its decision to push forward early with foldable devices has paid off in terms of converting customers. It says that “compared to the Galaxy Note 20, Samsung has seen a 150 percent increase in consumers who switched smartphone brands for the Galaxy Z Flip 3.” If you want to attract new money, it helps to offer something unique.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>12 great apps ready for your new 2021 Mac </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hl-k061DcpSRSb5eQp45aCJ16eU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330299/RoundUpArt_MacApps.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Make your Mac more useful and easier to use&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6hVfKX"&gt;With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;fancy new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;colorful new iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;2020’s still-excellent M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; all offering incredible performance and battery life, it’s never been a better time to give (or receive) a new Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2N023u"&gt;And as more and more people are shifting to remote work, that laptop or computer you buy has to do more than ever. So we’ve rounded up some of our favorite Mac apps, designed to help you be more productive or to simply just make using your computer and navigating day-to-day life and Zoom calls a little more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vfrK0I"&gt;Pixelmator Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pixelmator Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wm85YudeA9bT8DVnGco58KaEA-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075769/Pixelmator_Pro_2.3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Pixelmator Team&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixelmator Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fh8os"&gt;Adobe Photoshop is a key tool for image and photo editing, but it’s super expensive, thanks to its monthly $9.99 subscription. Pixelmator Pro, on the other hand, has a one-time fee of $19.99 while still offering tons of powerful tools for editing your photos. The latest update added a host of useful new features, including the ability to instantly remove the background from an image and improved masking and selection tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8MhEd1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925828" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CCgQZ8"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DIPd8P"&gt;Spark&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Spark" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oE0kpfUvlQk5N0VGYKQJYnwKfr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075780/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.19.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Readdle Technologies&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KsVprW"&gt;Spark is one of my favorite email apps for mobile, and the company’s Mac app is just as great, offering a fast UI, helpful automated sorting, and tons of customization for power users. And it supports Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, Yahoo, Exchange, and more, along with integrations for popular work services like Trello, Asana, Zoom, and GoToMeeting. No one likes having to deal with email, but Spark makes it a little easier to get it done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A1Yu2A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925844" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TkfmNn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bjYpOF"&gt;Tweetbot&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gl-HeGv2HhwGyw0t7M0uf6vNgKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075785/tweetbot.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKu7Ps"&gt;Twitter’s official app exists and is free, but Tweetbot is infinitely better if you’re the kind of person that spends a lot of time on Twitter. The paid app has no ads or suggested tweets clogging up your timeline — instead, it just offers the revolutionary feature of showing all the tweets from the people you follow in the chronological order that they tweeted it. The app looks great, too, with a clean, simple interface that makes reading Twitter &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nb64CE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925866" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0eW9lR"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ot4Wq5"&gt;Alfred 4 for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alfred 4 for Mac" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5_knYjl45pEuwzRgScCArjECRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075793/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.24.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Crayons&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alfred 4 for Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EPijo8"&gt;Like many apps on this list, Alfred does something that one of Apple’s built-in apps already does — in this case, search your computer. But Alfred is way better: a lightning-fast search tool and app launcher that supports virtually endless customization, including automated workflows, bespoke Google searches, or whatever else you can think of. Once you use it for a few days, you’ll never be able to go back to Spotlight again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gSGC9M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925913" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UZteYP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GtA7Iv"&gt;DaisyDisk&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DaisyDisk" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4q3Sbj8VwAlttS3QyJVMSfDExEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075797/cloud_report_screenshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Software Ambience&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DaisyDisk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fOkL92"&gt;It happens to everyone sooner or later: after a few years of accumulating photos, videos, music, and other random documents, you start to get the dreaded notifications that you’re running out of room on your hard drive. DaisyDisk is meant to help — it scans your computer and shows you just how much storage you’re using, broken down by files and folders in neat, colorful rings that make it simple to dial down to the junk that’s taking up all your space and clear out your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fnu9Pm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925922" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Mu0Wp8"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lus7Ul"&gt;1Password&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="1Password" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVnSkZdNVEl719ksKbCbMxzPRNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075798/storage_2x.ca9de9e2db658ec27544b2be4749863d.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;1Password&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MLgOA5"&gt;Your passwords probably aren’t secure enough. 1Password will help you fix that, generating ultra-secure passwords and keeping track of everything. With deep integration into both Safari and Chrome, a clean UI, and tons of useful added features for protecting not just passwords but credit cards, documents, and more, it’s a one-stop shop for securing your digital life. An individual subscription is $36 per year, but if you have more than one person in your household, you’re probably better off with the five-person family subscription for $60 per year that adds the option to share passwords, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3pXcpl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925931" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="E5czqB"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BsUyTa"&gt;Authy Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Authy" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKu-Qu8f21ikWlHHrk83QCOej6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075799/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.26.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twilio&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="de49OW"&gt;If you’re not using two-factor authentication for your important passwords and log-ins, go do that now. Authy is one of the better apps around for your two-factor setup, with cross-platform apps on iOS and Android. The Mac app does exactly what the mobile versions do: it gets you your 2FA codes when you need to log in. But it’s far more helpful, due to its being on the computer that you’re probably trying to log into something on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EODa1X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925997" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PV8WNU"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iq0vE5"&gt;MonitorControl&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MonitorControl" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLwOpR6A5cY2GJqReY3yv0dmxy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075805/monitorcontrol.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MonitorControl&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MonitorControl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FFJSrx"&gt;As more people shift towards working remotely, there’s been a big uptick in building out home offices and using an external monitor. MonitorControl is a nifty little menubar app that lets you control your external display’s brightness and volume (if it has built-in speakers) using your Mac’s function keys, just like on Apple’s own hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mGipeQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926032" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CEfEHe"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pkQL0p"&gt;Hand Mirror&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hand Mirror" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0jLQZGXwyMO51d9mLp2AZ2txr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075806/screenshot.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Hand Mirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand Mirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g4USze"&gt;Video calls are a bigger part of the day-to-day workplace than ever before. Hand Mirror is a simple app that lives in your Mac’s menubar and is designed to help you look your best on calls: a single click, and it launches a quick window that shows what the current view from your webcam is, letting you double-check that you’ve moved all the workout gear or messy laundry from your background or that your hair is neat &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you start your Zoom call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dMUKwT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926063" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yDs0WP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nsSZH"&gt;Dozer&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dozer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h7LJkwWAiNLzYc3rESNRkNKNnEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075812/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.29.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mortennn&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dozer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CqH7Wm"&gt;Managing your menubar apps can get out of hand pretty quickly (especially if you just installed any of the ones that we’re recommending here). And it’s only become a bigger problem thanks to Apple’s new MacBook Pro models, which eat up a big chunk of your menubar real estate with a hefty webcam notch. Well, Dozer is here to help. It’s a free app that makes it easy to hide all the menubar icons for things you want open but don’t necessarily need to have visible all the time. If you prefer a little more flash, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.macbartender.com/"&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $15 but offers a fancier design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKFbZY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926073" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KshH7i"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="krM9gS"&gt;Meeter&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Meeter" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5HEnoof2Wt5xJuUFAvqdtw0R-A4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075813/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_10.30.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bardeen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meeter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i37pxV"&gt;Meeter is another menubar app that’s designed to help with one thing: wrangling all your different Zoom, Google Meet, Webex, Teams, and other video calls into a single place, with one-click links to join whatever meetings you have scheduled. The free app links to your Mac’s built-in Calendar app and can pull in any video calls it sees, putting them in a handy drop-down menu, complete with notifications to remind you to join before your call starts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QzA7h3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926082" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ckQL93"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TMs2Ku"&gt;VLC&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="VLC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D9APnc3iWS_MKLu1j85WfB2kYh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075815/EsCB_03XIAgjW_T.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: VideoLan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VLC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F35vNm"&gt;Local media playback isn’t the critical function it once was, thanks to the rise of streaming as the main way of consuming movies, TV shows, and music. But for those times that you do need to play a local audio or video file, there’s still no better app than VLC, which can handle virtually any file format or codec you’ve ever heard of and quite a few that you haven’t. Plus, it’s completely free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sKd9fj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925589" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1ZbhMa"&gt;
&lt;p id="o7BlKz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW, IBM, Panasonic, and Mercedes to skip planned in-person events at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Attendees walk through the Las Vegas Convention Center January 10, 2020 on the final day of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMGvZxqSubxFb3b2WJ-BhDTYvAk=/5x0:4996x3327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330060/1192992530.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attendees walk through the Las Vegas Convention Center January 10, 2020 on the final day of the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show (CES)&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nb0HqF"&gt;BMW has announced it will no longer be showing up in person for media events at CES 2022 — the giant electronics show that’s typically held each January in Las Vegas, attracting well over 100,000 attendees per year from around the world. It’s the latest company to at least partially bail on the show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;following announcements from Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta,&lt;/a&gt; Waymo, and a large number of tech publications, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as COVID cases rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EggSjj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reports indicated BMW will show a car with color-changing paint and a “Theater Screen” for in-car cinematic experiences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PPzBBN"&gt;A statement from BMW says, “Out of an abundance of caution, BMW will move all planned media activities at CES to a fully online program from Germany on January 5.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfckIt"&gt;While it’s a late scratch compared to some other announcements, it’s not the only featured exhibitor recently announcing a change of plans, as IBM said it will forgo in-person appearances. In a statement, an IBM spokesperson says, “Due to the evolving COVID conditions - and out of an abundance of caution - IBM has recently decided not to participate on-site in Las Vegas this year. We do still look forward to participating virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esTeSB"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/ces-2022-amid-covid-surge-mercedes-amd-and-oneplus-drop-out-joining-microsoft-google-intel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that fellow German automaker Mercedes-Benz is going to skip the in-person event as well, while &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/ces-2022-covid-dropouts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says Panasonic, which usually has a massive central hall booth, is shifting to a virtual showing but with “limited on-site staffing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N96vro"&gt;In a statement, Panasonic North America CEO Megan Myungwon Lee says, “The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers remains our top priority. With this commitment in mind, we have updated our hybrid CES activation plans maintaining a modified physical footprint, with limited on-site staff, following CTA’s health safety protocols as well as our own proactive measures to ensure the health and well-being of attendees. We have shifted our press conference to a fully-virtual platform and will continue with our plan to deliver a seamless, virtual experience highlighting our newest technology products, solutions and innovations across Sustainable Energy, Smart Mobility, Immersive Experiences, Food Tech Solutions, Lifestyle Technologies and Healthy Environments.”&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last few years, BMW has had a significant showing at CES in recent years, demonstrating cars around the outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center while also showcasing innovative demos inside, like at the last pre-pandemic show in 2020 where attendees could customize their own concept car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZjwSg"&gt;This year at CES, &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43494/bmw-will-show-car-paint-that-changes-color-with-the-touch-of-a-button-at-ces"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports BMW said it would have a car with color-changing paint, while &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/12/15/bmw-theater-screen-ces-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said we should also expect to see a new Theater Screen that “really gives an immersive, cinematic experience in the vehicle” that could launch in high-end models like the 7 Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuXmmH"&gt;Mercedes will continue with &lt;a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-bb71195b68ec7523e1b4dfa8cc0e738b-digital-world-premiere-of-the-vision-eqxx-the-most-efficient-mercedes-benz-ever"&gt;an all-digital premiere of its new Vision EQXX&lt;/a&gt;, which it says is “the most efficient vehicle the brand has ever built.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Theranos failed, but other researchers might not</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ug967aRZaF48U4qyb7CriMrScaQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330156/ep2_v12_notext.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ljdqhx"&gt;Jurors are still deliberating over the fate of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of defunct biotech company Theranos. They’re deciding if she intentionally misled investors, patients, and doctors about what her company’s blood testing technology could do. Because despite big promises, the tech the company claimed to have invented... didn’t actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCZgub"&gt;And the technology might &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be a reality — at least not in the way Holmes described it. In this episode of our three-part series on Theranos, we look at what researchers actually think is possible in the field of blood testing and what the future could look like.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla recalls nearly half a million Model 3 and Model S cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZM6CgRRzS6zGu_Q_oaqOqcfhJJo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330039/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O7CdKE"&gt;Tesla has issued voluntary recalls for nearly half a million vehicles to address potential failures in its trunk latching systems, &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-recall-models-trunk-crash-issues-51640868026?tesla=y"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Barron’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The recalls apply to &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2019/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/RWD#recalls"&gt;all Model 3 units&lt;/a&gt; released between 2017 and 2020, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2015/TESLA/MODEL%252520S%25252070D/5%252520HB/AWD#recalls"&gt;certain Model S units&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUoHyZ"&gt;For the Model 3, Tesla believes the opening and closing of the trunk could damage the cable harness attaching the rearview camera, causing the camera to unexpectedly fail. The Model S issue is more serious, potentially preventing the front trunk from fully latching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibkiQh"&gt;According to documents submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are 475,318 vehicles subject to the recall, comprising 356,309 Model 3 vehicles and 119,109 Model S vehicles. Tesla estimates that only 1 percent of the Model 3 vehicles will actually display the defect, compared to 14 percent of the recalled Model S vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFOGCq"&gt;The Model S recall is particularly concerning because the issue affects the front trunk, which could obstruct the driver’s view of the road if it flies open while driving. In the affected Model S cars, “the front trunk latch assembly may be misaligned, preventing the secondary hood latch from engaging,” Tesla told NHTSA in an official filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCXZEs"&gt;Since the Model S problem is a misalignment rather than a damaged component, Tesla believes that repositioning the latch device at a service center will resolve the issue. For affected Model 3 owners, Tesla has pledged to install a new cable harness and guide protector free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s photo-focused Xperia 1 III is down to its best price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_CxeZ8k2x_ygSDoZL6IeEn4TEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70330017/ajohnson_210712_4667_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjDaKo"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 1 III has a few things that other flagship phones don’t, including a near-4K, 120Hz OLED display, along with plenty of high-quality manual photo and video controls, dual front-facing speakers, and a headphone jack. And yet, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Allison Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;couldn’t recommend&lt;/a&gt; it — mostly due to its high $1,300 cost. Though, today’s deal on the phone makes the price just a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;more digestible. For only the second time since it launched during the summer, Sony’s unlocked Xperia 1 III smartphone has returned to its all-time low price of $1,198 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xperia-III-Smartphone-6-5-21/dp/B091YC2SJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsox1m3.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeSonyExperia1III123021"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX5b51"&gt;For context, that’s around the same price as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; and even cheaper than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; with equivalent storage capacity. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjekA7kR3O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also has the smartphone on sale for $1,199.99, yet the retailer is also throwing in a free Microsoft 365 trial and a 50 percent discount on an Ultra Mobile SIM kit, if those things matter to you. For those impressed enough by the promise of the phone’s screen and its excellent photo and video-shooting capabilities, this could be a great chance to snag the device before the price goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0X7Mpr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10952660"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8EWbh0"&gt;Lenovo’s excellent Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop is selling at a great price over at Antonline. While it costs around &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-7-16GB-RAM-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-512GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Gray-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals123021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,850 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (it’s rarely in stock for its $1,530 MSRP, unfortunately), &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Lenovo/Computers/Computer_Systems/Notebooks/1436996" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s down to $1,489.99 at Antonline&lt;/a&gt;, and the value is tough to beat for this price. This model has a 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display at QHD Plus resolution, AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip (with a total graphics power of 130W), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Basically, it’s a stacked machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JotRRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Cameron Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; this laptop in 2021, praising its performance and specs for the price. He even went as far as to refer to it as “Lenovo’s best gaming laptop yet.” The Legion 5 Pro also impressed with its typing experience and the amount of ports available. It’s tough to find a laptop that’s this powerful for under $1,800. For context, it’s about as capable as Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eMvXUc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10843973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XEemS"&gt;Looking to warm up your home while saving a bit of money on heating costs? Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQT85FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the Ecobee SmartThermostat for $199&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off), matching its Black Friday price. The smart thermostat features a touchscreen display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; was more responsive and easier to navigate than the one on its predecessor. It also supports voice controls and flexible scheduling, and it includes an external temperature sensor that will help maintain comfort in remote rooms. This smart thermostat offers support for HomeKit and Siri and is also compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT, and SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6TBezw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10789596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wCqQ3a"&gt;One of our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best SSDs compatible with the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; recently dropped to its lowest price to date. Normally $229.99, B&amp;amp;H Photo is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1593680-REG%2Fsamsung_mz_v8p1t0b_am_1tb_980_pro_pcie.html%2FSID%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F30%2F22858521%2Fsony-xperia-1-iii-smartphone-apple-airpods-max-ecobee-smart-thermostat-samsung-980-pro-ssd-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s lightning-quick 980 Pro PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD for $149.99&lt;/a&gt; (discount applies at checkout). That’s $80 off one of the few drives out there that meets Sony’s performance requirements for its latest console, assuming you have a heatsink like &lt;a href="https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-m-2-nvme-heatsink-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EKWB’s EK-M2 NVMe&lt;/a&gt; to pair with it. This M.2 SSD also works with PC, but you need to have a compatible motherboard to enjoy its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds. Otherwise, it’ll still work but at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8LQq3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXP5LD"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to headphones, you still have four days left to snag a set of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 for their lowest price to date. Regularly $149.99, Woot is selling the true wireless earbuds — which come with support for active noise cancellation — for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDealRoundup122921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt; through January 3rd. Note, however, that these don’t come with Samsung’s one-year warranty but rather a 90-day warranty through Woot. Think twice about this. We’ve seen the price at other retailers dipping down to around $110, but Woot’s deal might be the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KMhK4"&gt;After reviewing them, my colleague Chris Welch was impressed by their audio quality as well as their small, discreet design. In fact, these wireless earbuds are easily some of Samsung’s smallest and lightest yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96Zafn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jBFpoG"&gt;Some other good deals happening now:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PlZUg3"&gt;If you need a new power adapter, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy Apple’s official 20W USB-C adapter for $15.69&lt;/a&gt; instead of $19 at Amazon, its lowest price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zUwfxE"&gt;A few of Oculus’ must-have accessories for the Quest 2 headset are still discounted, including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap at $39&lt;/a&gt; (usually $49) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard zip-up case for $39&lt;/a&gt; (also normally $49).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IISEE3"&gt;You can reserve a pair of the AirPods Max at Micro Center &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/632264/apple-airpods-max-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-space-gray" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re currently only available for in-store pickup in select regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6rWSSG"&gt;Amazon is discounting the Eve Energy Strip, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Energy-Strip-overvoltage-overcurrent/dp/B07PX57RH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling it for an all-time low of $79.96&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the on-page coupon. The Eve Energy Strip makes it easy to independently control three power outlets via Siri, an app, or using a handful of other devices while at home or away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="peXUTj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082G5BDNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjfrEqT5DB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are both selling Razer’s Basilisk v2 wired gaming mouse for $34.99 instead of $79.99. The latter is also offering a $10 discount on Microsoft’s PC Game Pass with your purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some great ways to tweak your new PC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SwVdsW"&gt;This year marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;the launch of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. Stock permitting, there are a variety of PCs and laptops available with Microsoft’s new operating system, and while the updated Microsoft Store fills out with apps, we figured we’d put together a list of our 11 favorite apps for a new Windows 11 PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRkdgf"&gt;We’re covering productivity, gaming, and media playback, so there should be an app for everyone here. There are even some options to bring back Windows 10 functionality if you’re missing some of the features and customizations Windows used to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i0xzk2"&gt;EarTrumpet&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EarTrumpet" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxAAgsaHQAb7t7zSpMRRxMU6Q4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098073/I036YhD.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: File-New-Project&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EarTrumpet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JW7TDE"&gt;Microsoft’s built-in Windows 11 audio management still isn’t great. EarTrumpet overhauls it completely, with a system tray utility that gives you volume levels for every app and the ability to set custom inputs and outputs for those apps. If you want YouTube to play out of your speakers but prefer that your game audio output on your headset, then this is the app for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GXY64D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925408" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1HcEbi"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9WU5dB"&gt;Tweeten&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tweeten" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZEk2QIqIieInt5tRWp3p3Au5gE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7696055/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mehedi Hassan‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tweeten&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cURsfv"&gt;Twitter’s app for Windows is just a web app, and TweetDeck doesn’t even have its own dedicated app. If you’re a fan of TweetDeck, Tweeten gives you TweetDeck on Windows by taking the web interface of TweetDeck and making it a lot more Windows 11-friendly. There are a bunch of customization options and even a notification interface if you want to be alerted to Twitter activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U26kS4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925424" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="X9yh1E"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fy6zt4"&gt;FeedLab&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="FeedLab" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNuIEr6wguc_9hIwk-Ax2Pg9g8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098076/Jg3Yslv.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ClevLab‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FeedLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vcCryd"&gt;There are lots of RSS apps available on Windows, but FeedLab is my top pick. I’ve been using this RSS reader ever since Nextgen Reader suddenly stopped working on new PCs. FeedLab has a lot of customization and features for reading your daily list of news, and it’s updated regularly. While the app is free, it’s supported by ads, but they’re easy to remove if you’re willing to support the dev with a one-time ad removal fee that’s essentially the price of a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ThMOTy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925442" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Ws5uBW"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P2iPtb"&gt;PowerToys&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PowerToys for Windows" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUJ-0tfAwWUhibKp4Eio2FQeCsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19983955/zV54Lfn.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PowerToys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ms3jZ"&gt;Microsoft’s PowerToys for Windows are essential if you want more customization over how Windows works. There are a variety of tools available, including utilities to keep your PC awake, a system-wide color picking tool, and a FancyZones window manager that lets you quickly position apps into different layouts. One of my favorite PowerToys is Run, which acts as a Mac-like launcher to let you find apps and files or quickly search the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZRd7wc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925447" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="58406Y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tq27OF"&gt;OneNote&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="OneNote" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XIO69PsqEkrERgC_dPCw7wyHCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098097/vX7MPdy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneNote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kWpM4C"&gt;I use OneNote daily to arrange my notes for work and sync them across my PC, laptop, and phone. OneNote is free and fully featured and allows you to divide notes into separate notebooks, sections, and pages. It also fully supports inking, so if you want to take actual notes with a stylus, then it’s ideal. I’d highly recommend this app to students and those who need to take notes regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T5hsiO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925463" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RLNLGN"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="geAvyW"&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Adobe Photoshop Express" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Gg8afDCoo-2vg2Ielhg6HtKP1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098107/adobe.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8gEenq"&gt;Adobe Photoshop Express is a free photo editing tool that has all the basics you need. While photo editing in the Photos app in Windows 11 has improved, Photoshop Express includes easy-to-use slide bar adjustments and automatic one-touch fixes. There are also a bunch of correction features and even a spot heal feature that lets you remove blemishes or dirt and dust from photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJDHV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925484" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ceA5ys"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qXToMh"&gt;ShareX&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ShareX" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s0V_73g9FIQZZgBTndS-hln4hoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098103/dHKmHfo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ‪ShareX Team‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ShareX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1DFeaR"&gt;ShareX is the best screenshot tool for Windows 11. It’s a great little power-user utility that will let you quickly crop, doodle, and even create GIFs or screen recordings. You can also snap a screenshot and automatically upload it to Imgur or other file hosting websites with one tap of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nXOjZd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925505" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DYpghA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sz4M7t"&gt;QuickLook&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="QuickLook" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2LIzTga3KyTkga4aF8llO5nLS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098105/qTwsCEP.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ‪Paddy Xu‬&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;QuickLook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qowk4F"&gt;QuickLook is a great app to install if you’re switching from a Mac to a PC, but it’s useful for seasoned PC users, too. It lets you quickly preview files in File Explorer using your spacebar. It works just like the macOS Quick Look feature — you can hit enter to open the file in its default app or choose a different app. It works well for most file types that you’d want to preview, but GIFs might take an extra few seconds to load. QuickLook is far better than constantly opening files to find the one you’re looking for or squinting at thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zh4Ecm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925509" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2NVqBb"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qUCwLT"&gt;Start11&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Start11" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tYkukWgAixA2QfATDpJ9YB9ONE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775843/S11_10.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Stardock&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J5m82k"&gt;Stardock’s new Start11 app lets you skin the appearance of the Windows 11 Start menu. You can bring back the classic appearance of the Start menu, change the taskbar size, and position it across multiple monitors. Windows 11 users shouldn’t really need to resort to third-party apps just to bring back basic taskbar functionality that has existed in Windows for decades, but until Microsoft addresses this area, Start11 certainly helps. If you’re missing the time and date on multiple monitors, there’s also &lt;a href="https://github.com/martinet101/ElevenClock"&gt;ElevenClock&lt;/a&gt; that will help until Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812258/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-clock-multiple-monitors-start-menu-updates"&gt;brings back this feature next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cON3zs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925515" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wYp5P3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="po8bFc"&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dolby Access" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8v_kq2G150cFzsddxP_i9LjtlJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098116/Xd9aCzM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dolby&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sTimex"&gt;If you play a lot of PC games, I recommend Dolby Atmos for Headphones. It’s part of the Dolby Access app and will set you back $14.99 for the license, but if you’re a gamer who wants to hear all the footsteps of your enemies, then it’s well worth it. The license also extends to an Xbox, so if you have an Xbox One or Xbox Series X / S, you’ll get full Dolby Atmos support there, too. There’s even a 30-day trial, so you can try Dolby Atmos for Headphones and see if it sounds better than Microsoft’s built-in Windows Sonic spatial sound option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WngGra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925559" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2YU9bT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vp5LWG"&gt;VLC for Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="VLC for Windows" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2YE1WDej6bVbNSmG50v30cwhrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098124/50XLeGs.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: VideoLan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VLC for Windows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iBqUzz"&gt;Thanks to streaming services, it feels increasingly rare to play local audio or video content on PCs these days, but VLC does it all without any fuss. It’s a free app that supports a variety of codecs, so it should play anything you throw at it. VLC also supports streaming from network locations, so pretty much every video playback scenario is covered with this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IIbACO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925589" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tom Brady says the next sideline Surface he yeets will cost him</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8YrAP"&gt;On the Sunday Night Football stage, December 19th, Tom Brady and the Buccaneers were swept for the second consecutive regular season against the Saints — a frustrating shut-out loss that had Brady &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846124/tom-brady-destroy-microsoft-surface-tablet"&gt;spiking a poor Microsoft Surface&lt;/a&gt; tablet on the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="IhibyQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tom Brady threw the tablet after his INT  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFLBrasil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NFLBrasil&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;a href="https://t.co/PyvdFi30NO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PyvdFi30NO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1472782726424109061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSgTmN"&gt;Now, per Brady on his Let’s Go podcast &lt;a href="https://lets-go.simplecast.com/episodes/tom-brady-division-champs-new-years-resolution"&gt;that aired Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the NFL is not going to let the Surface abuse continue. Should the seven-time Super Bowl champion throw the tablet again, he will be fined. “I did get warned from the NFL about that so... I won’t throw another Surface.” Brady said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LxR3R"&gt;The co-host of the podcast, Jim Gray, joked that the whole incident was just good marketing for Microsoft’s tablet — which has been in use by NFL teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/3/5964307/nfl-replaces-black-and-white-photographs-with-surface-tablets-on-the"&gt;since 2014&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163685/microsoft-nfl-partnership-teams-official-communication-app"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; won a deal to have all 32 NFL teams use them. Gray asked Brady to clarify what exactly the warning from the NFL was; to which Brady responds eloquently: “I can’t throw another Surface, or else I get fined. Imagine that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VlswQe"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/recast/524df40b-20f4-5f00-a5e2-e9b1e472e979" height="600" width="600" title="Tom Brady - Division Champs &amp;amp; New Year's Resolution" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQyqZ"&gt;Brady also joked on &lt;a href="https://lets-go.simplecast.com/episodes/tom-brady-tough-loss-andrea-bocelli"&gt;last week’s&lt;/a&gt; episode of the Let’s Go podcast: “I didn’t want to throw an interception with that tablet, so I made sure it hit the ground” he said. Brady continued to facetiously chronicle the Surface’s demise: “It was out of use, there was no chance of that one being used after I got a hold of that tablet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcDvj0"&gt;“I‘m having a great time playing,” the now 15-time pro bowler said despite the incident “I know it didn’t look like it when I snapped that tablet in half.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cN4C6"&gt;It’s not the first time Brady had tossed a Surface in frustration; he threw the tablet last season as well against the Chicago Bears — the game where it looked like he had forgotten what down it was (he later &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-comes-clean-on-fourth-down-gaffe-in-loss-to-bears-in-surprising-tiktok-confession/"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; to it on TikTok) and the Bucs ultimately lost by one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJEzjB"&gt;Let’s not totally blame Brady for chucking the tablet though — after all, it was probably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/2/13139174/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface"&gt;nurtured behavior&lt;/a&gt; coming from his legacy in New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pUICzI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Honestly, I spike like 3 tablets a week working on the NYT Mini Crossword. Need to get it under control. “Let’s Go!” is out everywhere now: &lt;a href="https://t.co/40yM3vSNPl"&gt;https://t.co/40yM3vSNPl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/UKl4P2KPWY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UKl4P2KPWY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Brady (@TomBrady) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TomBrady/status/1473429623971139590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>A vehicle burned at Canoo’s headquarters after a battery test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPBpwC9YNDV3yoLbUlDD1HtJkL0=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70328779/canoo_Design_Exterior_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6U7JXO"&gt;A vehicle at EV startup Canoo burned on August 24th after lithium-ion batteries left inside the car started a fire. The local fire department was able to extinguish the blaze and no one was injured, according to an &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23133022/Incident_21_0009517_19951_Mariner_Ave_R.pdf"&gt;incident report&lt;/a&gt; obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7J7dx"&gt;The fire happened in the parking lot outside Canoo’s Torrance, California corporate office, which was once the startup’s headquarters — before it started calling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783974/canoo-moves-to-walmart-hometown"&gt;Bentonville, Arkansas home in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4a7Yf"&gt;Canoo’s VP of communications Agnes Gomes-Koizumi confirmed the fire occurred after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; requested comment. “A small fire occurred several hours after the intentionally destructive testing of a battery module,” Gomes said in an e-mailed statement, noting the module passed the test and did not ignite. The fire happened because “someone inappropriately placed the module in a sealed container,” she wrote. “The box the module was placed in became pressurized and resulted in the incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUj686"&gt;The car wasn’t one of Canoo’s prototypes, Gomes said, but a third-party cargo vehicle the company had rented or purchased. The incident report lists it as a Ford. Canoo announced a deal to use batteries from Panasonic subsidiary Sanyo &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-21-054442/0001213900-21-054442.pdf"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear who made the batteries involved in the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q80ekY"&gt;Canoo is working towards a goal of starting production on its electric vans in late 2022, though it has also been turning over executives along the way — including, this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22839732/canoo-cto-cofounders-resign-shakeup-leadership-tony-aquila"&gt;losing its chief technology officer and two of the five remaining co-founders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8seUF"&gt;The company joins some other EV startups in dealing with battery fires. One of Faraday Future’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17930524/faraday-future-evergrande-investment-jia-yueting-fire"&gt;preproduction vehicles caught fire in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, a prototype of Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck &lt;a href="https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire"&gt;caught fire in February 2021&lt;/a&gt; during a road test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dUktZ"&gt;Those other fires originated from battery packs that were powering the respective prototype vehicles. Canoo’s fire started in the cabin of the third-party vehicle, according to the report, where lithium-ion batteries were “being transported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytKMMH"&gt;After the fire was extinguished, an officer from Los Angeles County’s Health Hazmat team was called to the scene to help investigate the battery explosion. The remains of the batteries were placed in a “trash can filled with water,” per Health Hazmat’s instructions. The Torrance Fire Department’s report says the fire did an estimated $45,000 worth of damage, including $10,000 in property damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSStnU"&gt;The fire department was on the scene for three and a half hours, though the report doesn’t say how long it took to extinguish the blaze. “The facility was opened the next day and has been functioning normally,” Gomes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8Arxv"&gt;The report lists “improper container or storage procedure” and “[u]nattended or unsupervised person” as factors that contributed to the fire. Torrance Fire Department did not respond to multiple emailed requests for comment, and LA County’s Health Hazmat team declined to make someone available for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
