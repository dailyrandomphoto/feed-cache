    <title>Woman detained for protesting Tesla at Shanghai auto show </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L50eoy"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928?mod=article_inline"&gt;simmering issue of how Tesla deals with customer complaints in China&lt;/a&gt; came to a boil this week as police detained a woman after she protested at Tesla’s booth at the Auto Shanghai 2021 trade show. The woman was dragged off the show floor after jumping on top of a Tesla Model 3, where she shouted about a brake issue the company has been criticized for with its China-made cars. Tesla has since said it will conduct a self-inspection of its service and operations in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa1HRq"&gt;The woman, who police referred to only by her surname “Zhang,” according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, was detained for “disrupting public order.” She has protested before about the brake issue, after she was involved in a crash. She is reportedly being held for five days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL3aHP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A female Tesla owner climbed on top of a car’s roof at the Tesla booth to protest her car’s brake malfunction at the Shanghai auto show Monday. The booth beefed up its security after the incident. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ct7RmF1agM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ct7RmF1agM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1384021874439462918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G2VoLj"&gt;Video of Zhang on top of the Tesla went viral on Monday across China’s biggest social networks, and on Twitter, where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1384021874439462918"&gt;state-owned tabloid Global Times shared a clip&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuEOTL"&gt;Tesla’s China division initially said on Chinese platform Weibo that Zhang had crashed her car because she was speeding, but &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; it still hasn’t “fulfilled [its] wish” to “win assurance and understanding from consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Szdywe"&gt;That response stoked an already fervent reaction to the protest. Another state-owned news outlet, CCTV, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/autoshow-chinese-woman-who-stormed-tesla-display-car-show-detained-5-days-2021-04-20/"&gt;called for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the alleged brake problems, while a third, Xinhua, said &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1998869/a-womans-tesla-protest-stole-the-spotlight-at-shanghai-auto-show/"&gt;Tesla showed “no sincerity in solving the problem.”&lt;/a&gt; Government agencies have spoken up, too. The Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central Committee said on WeChat that Tesla should respect Chinese consumers and comply with local laws and regulations, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-20/tesla-knocks-keep-coming-as-china-chides-over-vehicle-safety?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said “enterprises should not be arrogant and unreasonable,” according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vAZgbP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s initial response only stoked the criticism from customers and state agents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pNhzmi"&gt;The reaction was so intense that Tesla released a second statement Tuesday apologizing for not handling Zhang’s complaints sooner. It also capitulated slightly on the brake issue, saying in the same statement that it will now review its service and operations as a result of the protest and the backlash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDDRnH"&gt;Tesla has been making cars in China since it opened a new factory outside Shanghai in early 2020 — the first in the country to be wholly-owned by a foreign automaker. While that factory already accounts for a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/tesla-china-demand-powers-ahead-with-record-registrations?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;huge part of Tesla’s global sales&lt;/a&gt;, the company has been plagued with complaints about the quality of the cars it makes there. Tesla was rebuked by multiple government agencies earlier this year in China over &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928?mod=article_inline"&gt;how it’s handled customer complaints about the quality of its cars&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the company said it “sincerely accepted the guidance of government departments” and that it had “deeply reflected on [its] shortcomings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3PIbX"&gt;Tesla’s response to pressure from the Chinese government is a stark response to how it acts in the US, where CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/tesla-s-tone-with-china-authorities-differs-from-musk-s-in-u-s"&gt;often teases regulators&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forgot to revolutionize the Magic Mouse’s infamous charging port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_H3Aff0QEFsuLJU19YnTZ4K1AP8=/231x0:2639x1605/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159997/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_2.11.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the new Magic Mouse colors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kX4Lxl"&gt;Apple revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;a redesigned iMac and Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;its “Spring Loaded” event&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, but didn’t, for some reason, decide to change the Magic Mouse 2’s infamous charging solution. While the mouse will come in new colors to match the new iMacs, Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its charging port is still on the bottom — meaning that five and a half years after its introduction, Apple still seems to think that the best way to charge the mouse is by flipping it over (rendering it useless) and plugging in a Lightning cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmjxDi"&gt;The Magic Mouse’s charging situation has long been a bit of a joke — my former colleague Nick Statt equated it to looking like “a beetle with its legs in the air” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;all the way back in December 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and frankly, I’m having a hard time coming up with a better description.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JY7mfNejfVDbX486GvNIzYAolMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9833361/Apple_Magic_Mouse_Bad_Design_2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Mouse 2, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2oB2Xr"&gt;Why didn’t Apple didn’t take the opportunity to change things up alongside the new iMac and Magic Keyboard? The company made obvious and good improvements to both of those products. Why not tweak the Magic Mouse’s design to have, say, a charging port in the front? That’s how wired / wireless mice have done it for years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;including our favorite gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woB3ta"&gt;There is some hope that Apple is willing to dump bad design, though. The first Apple Pencil had a similarly meme-worthy charging solution that required you to plug it directly into a iPad’s Lightning port, but Apple fixed that years later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18023772/new-apple-pencil-2-2018-ipad-stylus-price-release-date"&gt;with the Apple Pencil 2&lt;/a&gt; by letting it wirelessly charge off the side of iPads that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H29froDJmJ7jGd02m_Yr6TsF07M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13358115/Apple_Pencil_Bad_Design.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Apple Pencil, charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p46ecz"&gt;And Apple finally responded to complaints about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300891/apple-tv-siri-remote-touchpad-button-design-form-function"&gt;frustratingly finicky&lt;/a&gt; touchpad on the Apple TV’s remote today by unveiling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;the new Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which has a scroll wheel and a clickpad. I’m crossing my fingers Apple will update the Magic Mouse next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will now let you buy an M1 Mac Mini with 10-gigabit networking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIff1-czpgmAu09IH-jKzuHA-cU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159929/cwelch_201114_4292_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1igo4"&gt;The M1-powered Mac Mini &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394631%2Fapple-m1-silicon-mac-mini-intel-networking-10gb-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can now be configured&lt;/a&gt; to included 10-gigabit networking, an option that the computer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;notably missing compared to its Intel-powered counterpart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/apple-silently-updates-m1-mac-mini-with-optional-10-gigabit-ethernet-port/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The update to the 2020 computer seems to have come during Apple’s store update that came with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;bigger product announcements today&lt;/a&gt;, including a new iMac and iPad Pros. Adding the faster networking will add $100 to the price of the computer — the same price as if you were to add 10Gbps to the Intel version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="expeBB"&gt;When Apple added the 10Gbps port as an option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18097117/apple-mac-mini-2018-review-upgrade-faster-more-powerful-features-price"&gt;the Mac Mini in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it was welcomed by those running home and professional servers, as well as anyone who needed fast network access from a cheaper Mac (like video professionals using network-attached storage). But when Apple introduced a faster version of the computer with its own custom chip, the ability to add networking faster than the standard Gigabit Ethernet was no longer there. If the lack of 10Gb networking took the (as of now) least expensive M1 computer out of the running for you, it’s now an option again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NI1UyM"&gt;You can order the Apple Silicon Mac Mini with faster networking today, but it may be a bit of a wait for the configuration — Apple estimates that I could have a stock M1 Mac Mini shipped to me in two days, but adding the 10Gb ethernet turns that into two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two queens in talks to join Marvel’s Secret Invasion on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74Qd38Flz_kHkmZd0O2ggKPAm8s=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159683/CaptainMarvel5ba0fe91d3532.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSd2x8"&gt;The Marvel Cinematic Universe may soon be home to two new queens. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/olivia-colman-in-talks-to-join-samuel-l-jackson-in-marvels-secret-invasion-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Olivia Colman was negotiating a role in Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion &lt;/em&gt;Disney Plus series, and today, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/emilia-clarke-secret-invasion-marvel-1234955746/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Emilia Clarke is in talks to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm5eAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is expected to be the television adaptation of the comics storyline of the same name that’s focused on a hostile takeover of Earth led by a shape-shifting alien race you may already know and love from &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;: the Skrulls. Few details have been revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;since the project was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but we do know the show will feature the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Ben Mendelsohn as the friendly Skrull Talos, who was last seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681596/spider-man-far-from-home-mid-post-credits-scene-plot-hole-nick-fury-maria-hill-aliens"&gt;impersonating Fury&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7T0in"&gt;There are some interesting possible characters for Colman and Clarke to play, too. In the comics, Empress Veranke is the leader of the Skrulls, and Colman’s time as both Elizabeth II on &lt;em&gt;The Crown &lt;/em&gt;and Queen Anne in &lt;em&gt;The Favorite&lt;/em&gt; could certainly translate to alien royalty. You could make the same case for Clarke’s turn as Daenerys Targaryen in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;as well. There’s also the possibility of Abigail Brand, the leader of extraterrestrial-focused security agency S.W.O.R.D., making an appearance in the show, which could be a great recurring role for either actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hc2nRA"&gt;There’s no announced release date for &lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, but with at least three Marvel films and several TV shows still slated to come out in 2021, there’s a good chance there’ll be some hints of what’s going on with the cosmic, space-based side of the Marvel universe soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You may have to actually pay for Apple TV Plus to watch Ted Lasso’s second season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B1EptwL5tAw0vo1N4La88skGlJI=/108x0:1280x781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159678/ted_lasso.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkJGBf"&gt;Apple TV Plus launched on November 1st, 2019, but odds are that you (along with almost two-thirds of other Apple TV Plus customers) aren’t actually paying for it, thanks to Apple’s lengthy free trials. But Apple may have finally found the carrot to convince people to actually shell out their hard-earned cash for another streaming service: the upcoming second season of sleeper hit &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to debut on TV Plus on July 23rd — just after Apple’s free subscriptions for its earliest customers end on July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bfKm3"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple TV Plus has a paying subscriber problem: as of January, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;research firm MoffettNathanson noted&lt;/a&gt; that approximately 62 percent of TV Plus subscribers are enjoying Apple’s free ride. The free trials for the service were originally intended to last a year, but Apple has kept extending them — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;first to February&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233276/apple-free-tv-plus-service-trials-extended"&gt;and then to July&lt;/a&gt;. The company still offers a free year for new customers, but July 1st will be the day that anyone who signed up at or shortly after launch runs out of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="joZ5Oh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple TV Plus is still looking for its big win","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21262291/apple-tv-plus-morning-show-licensed-movies-netflix-disney-plus-quibi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wINydT"&gt;Apple has been trying to grow TV Plus into a hit, but some of its highest-profile shows (like &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt;) failed to be the big, breakout hits that Apple was hoping for. And the ongoing extensions of the free trial period have started to feel like Apple was fishing for a big enough hit to hook customers into signing up — and somehow, it seems that the wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; might be it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow2nfS"&gt;The first season of the show (which is based on a series of Jason Sudeikis commercials) debuted quietly last summer, but the charming cast, heartfelt storytelling, and sheer optimism of the series have resonated with fans in the past several months. It’s also won Apple some of its streaming service’s most prestigious awards, including a Golden Globe for Sudeikis’ role as the titular coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQv0wd"&gt;The show is by far the biggest hit for Apple’s service, which makes the upcoming second season Apple’s best shot for hooking subscribers. That’s especially true since &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will offer 12 episodes, which could guarantee several months of customers given Apple’s weekly releases — enough, perhaps, for Apple to get subscribers on board with another big marquee show like &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295512/apple-tv-plus-foundation-show-trailer-isaac-asimov-wwdc-2020"&gt;its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is the old Apple TV HD still so expensive?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaoFx3fuFyTZN9flXFwKjihnEyM=/0x55:1305x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159585/AppleTVHD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xTKXdb"&gt;Apple refreshed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;Apple TV 4K streaming box&lt;/a&gt; today with upgraded specs and, perhaps most importantly, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;redesigned, simpler Siri remote&lt;/a&gt;. When the new device ships in late May, it’ll cost the same price as before: $179 for a 32GB unit or $199 for 64GB. (Sidenote: I’ve yet to meet anyone who has needed the higher storage option on any Apple TV.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUflyQ"&gt;But along with the new Apple TV 4K and improved remote — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJFM3LL%2FA%2Fsiri-remote%3Ffnode%3D990e806f0bfc36af5eebcfc8fa133eaec016ee7aa27dad125662ec22c9b5ad7434fc19e39ac8e19d0e35bdbe26ad2ed65f3382ac03c6aaae1ecc7c32096b0e1d8fb5ce1b176cfc2454a2fa411918ebecafff71fd1d67d13b70034373386abd62&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394168%2Fapple-tv-hd-siri-remote-too-expensive-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it standalone&lt;/a&gt; — it turns out Apple is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-hd%2F32gb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394168%2Fapple-tv-hd-siri-remote-too-expensive-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keeping the ancient 2015 Apple TV HD around&lt;/a&gt;. And for some reason, it still costs the same $149. I just... I don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mN7SCJ"&gt;How was this not the moment to slash the price to something more reasonable? Something closer to competitive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq5qKG"&gt;The price discrepancy between Apple TV 4K and 4K streamers from Roku, Amazon, and Google is already something that hurts Apple’s market share in the living room. But at least there’s a &lt;em&gt;case to be made&lt;/em&gt; with the new hardware. It’s got a faster chip (albeit still not Apple’s latest and greatest), covers the whole gamut of 4K / HDR / Dolby Atmos functionality you could want, and now includes Wi-Fi 6 and that flashy new screen calibration feature that works in conjunction with iPhones. And a lot of people appreciate Apple’s stance on privacy and are willing to chip in a bit extra for that cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CJ2F2L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SRoanA"&gt;But asking a dollar shy of $150 for a device with an aging processor that’s limited to HD playback in 2021 feels many steps past bewildering. The Apple TV has HDMI 1.4. It’s got Bluetooth 4, which means the new remote has fresher technology than the box itself. Sure, it can serve as a HomeKit hub, but so can the $99 HomePod mini. AirPlay 2? Yep, but many TVs and even Rokus can do that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvfUBz"&gt;Who wouldn’t just spend the extra $30 for the more future-proof Apple TV 4K? How many more tvOS updates are really in store for this thing? What are you getting here over a Roku Express or Fire TV Stick that is worth such a premium? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czLMrE"&gt;Yes, the new remote is clearly an improvement; I don’t even need to hold it to know that much. But Roku’s and Amazon’s remotes fall under “good enough” territory — especially when they come packaged with such affordable players. The Apple TV HD continues to live in a price bracket several rungs above streaming products from Amazon, Roku, and Google that can simply do more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfWPQr"&gt;Just look at how out of place it is in this price roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MEvuzB"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$199.99 &lt;/strong&gt;Nvidia Shield TV Pro (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m1VCk6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$179 &lt;/strong&gt;Apple TV 4K (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Pwcy9W"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$149.99&lt;/strong&gt; Nvidia Shield TV (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uer5yL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$149&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple TV HD (1080p HD)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tjANXE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$99.99&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon Fire TV Cube (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SGnaCV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$99.99&lt;/strong&gt; Roku Ultra (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I9Wnsa"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$49.99&lt;/strong&gt; Chromecast with Google TV (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2SfGba"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$49.99&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV Stick 4K (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jlJ5Ex"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$39.99&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV Stick (1080p HD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7T95Cw"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$39.99&lt;/strong&gt; Roku Express 4K Plus (4K HDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IkR0tK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$29.99&lt;/strong&gt; Fire TV Stick Lite (1080p HD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VVzWd1"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$29.99&lt;/strong&gt; Roku Express (1080p HD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0hmySd"&gt;It’d be one thing if Apple were just selling through remaining inventory. But the fact that the company is bothering to bundle the new Siri remote with the Apple TV HD suggests that it still has plenty of these boxes lying around and it isn’t on the way out in the immediate future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZDiwt"&gt;I don’t follow Apple’s thinking on the Apple TV HD still demanding such a high price, and it’s come to the point where I really can’t recommend this product to anyone. It’s an almost six-year-old device priced as if it were a modern top-spec streamer. Apple should either cut the price or just cut it loose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix subscriber growth is stalling as it runs low on hits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zqykUMHQ3b3ogZ-1DA4btaGr2hI=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159565/BRIDGERTON_108_Unit_01959R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from the Netflix series Bridgerton.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ywsjY"&gt;Netflix is seeing a slowdown in new subscriptions as the company puts out fewer shows following a year of delayed productions. The company now has 208 million paid subscribers across the globe, up from 204 million last quarter. That’s not much to complain about, but it’s a substantial slowdown compared to the rapid growth Netflix saw during the same time period in 2020 when it added four times as many new subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnJmRE"&gt;It’s also fewer subscribers than Netflix had hoped to add. The company believed it would hit 210 million subscribers by the end of the first quarter, but it came in 2 million short. The results were reported in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;Netflix’s Q1 2021 earnings release&lt;/a&gt;. Its stock fell around 10 percent in after-hours trading following the results, speaking to the surprise from investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EORyBd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix believes a “very strong back half slate” will boost subscriptions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P2gUwU"&gt;Netflix spends the bulk of its quarterly letter to shareholders explaining why it thinks there’s been such a dramatic slowdown in growth. The root of the problem — no surprise here — is the pandemic, Netflix says. The pandemic accelerated subscriptions this time last year when everyone was stuck at home and looking for things to watch. The pandemic also delayed production on shows and movies, leading to what Netflix describes as “a lighter content slate” for the first half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhWn30"&gt;Put the two together, and you’ve got the unfavorable comparison of putting a slower quarter up against a blockbuster quarter, which was never going to look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z35pV"&gt;The sluggish growth is expected to continue next quarter, with Netflix predicting only 1 million additional subscribers. Last year, it added 10 million during the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbL7rl"&gt;Things should turn around later in the year, Netflix says. A “very strong back half slate” — including the return of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher &lt;/em&gt;and debut of films with some big stars (The Rock, Leonardo DiCaprio) — should help to bring more people to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The chart shows Netflix’s 2021 additions (and Q2 forecast) falling below the years 2017 through 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FnnoVWHXamyexJZd6EoFv1WOLU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458016/netflix_earnings_q1_2021.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chart from Netflix showing its weekly subscriber additions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kmAOLw"&gt;Netflix has some catching up to do if it wants to continue growing at the same pace as it has in years past. A chart Netflix includes with its earnings (embedded above) shows the company falling substantially behind even its usual pace — in 2017 through 2019 — of gaining additional subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQNJWc"&gt;Not only does Netflix face constraints from the pandemic, but the company is also facing increased competition. HBO Max and Disney Plus continue to publish big titles on a regular basis. Netflix said its quarter started strong, thanks to &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Cobra Kai,&lt;/em&gt; but it evidently didn’t have enough hits in waiting to keep up with its former growth.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wisconsin amends Foxconn’s contract to reflect radically smaller project </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Foxconn’s “Fab”in Wisconsin. A state report says it no signs that it manufactures LCDs, or ever will" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/usFArhRcJLIny1LMoX0cC6rarlE=/0x3:7192x4798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159445/Foxconn_proof_08_080520_3892.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://aerialscapes.com" target="_blank"&gt;Curtis Waltz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlRolV"&gt;After more than three years of grandiose promises and missed deadlines, Foxconn and Wisconsin have agreed to amend their contract to reflect the reality of a much-diminished project. Under the amendment, which was approved by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) today, the company will receive vastly smaller tax subsidies in exchange for greater flexibility about what business it ultimately pursues in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s82Zex"&gt;Foxconn had originally promised to build an enormous LCD factory employing 13,000 workers and costing $10 billion. With the amendment, it now says it will employ a total of 1,454 people and invest $672 million. In return, the tax subsidies the company is eligible for have been slashed, from $2.85 billion to $80 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2wUphb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of 13,000 employees, Foxconn aims to hire 1,454&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jj53Vw"&gt;“When I ran to be governor, I made a promise to work with Foxconn to cut a better deal for our state—the last deal didn’t work for Wisconsin, and that doesn’t work for me,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement. “Today I’m delivering on that promise with an agreement that treats Foxconn like any other business and will save taxpayers $2.77 billion, protect the hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure investments the state and local communities have already made, and ensure there’s accountability for creating the jobs promised.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2mGK22uzz6W0JaafNL66pZ2PJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457988/Foxconn_Comparison_Document_4.20.21.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ttbm19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cBSo7"&gt;The original Foxconn deal was arranged in 2017 by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former President Trump, who called the project “the eighth wonder of the world” and touted it as a victory in his campaign to return manufacturing to the US. The Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant was supposed to build a 20 million-square-foot LCD manufacturing facility. In return, Wisconsin offered the company an incentive package worth more than $4 billion, a mix of “refundable” tax credits, land, and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEICNc"&gt;The project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;went awry almost immediately&lt;/a&gt;. Manufacturing LCDs in Wisconsin never made economic sense, yet abandoning the plan risked incurring Trump’s wrath. Instead, the company spent years pivoting wildly from idea to idea. The enormous “Gen 10.5” LCD factory specified in the contract became a far smaller Gen 6, then was canceled, then came back. The company announced it was building something called “the AI+8K+5G ecosystem,” to be developed in a network of “innovation centers,” buildings that the company purchased only to leave empty. It looked into building fish farms, exporting ice cream, storing boats. It announced plans to build coffee kiosks and ventilators that never moved forward. Most recently, it said it would build &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333868/foxconn-ev-wisconsin-fisker-geely-faraday-future"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt; — though maybe, the company acknowledged, that will happen in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QBmEY0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It looked into building fish farms, exporting ice cream, storing boats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GI8Fxu"&gt;Foxconn’s delays and dead ends put both parties in a difficult position. Wisconsin has already spent at least $400 million on land and infrastructure, and Mount Pleasant, the small town where the factory was to be built, took on hundreds of millions in debt that was supposed to be repaid by taxes generated by the project. Foxconn has both fallen orders of magnitude short of its promises and invested too much to painlessly walk away. It owns a lot of real estate in Southern Wisconsin now, and it has built an odd collection of buildings, including the million-square-foot structure it called the LCD Fab (though a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526765/foxconn-lcd-factory-not-real-confirmation-wisconsin-report-exclusive"&gt;government report&lt;/a&gt; found it was more akin to a demonstration facility) and a glass orb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaD8NQ"&gt;For two years, the Evers administration has been urging Foxconn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020885/foxconn-wisconsin-deal-renegotiate-tax-subsidy-lcd-factory-plant"&gt;to revise its contract&lt;/a&gt; to reflect its current plans, but the company refused. Last October, the latest attempt at negotiations failed, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21512638/wisconsin-foxconn-tax-subsidies-lcd-factory-rejected"&gt;WEDC denied the company&lt;/a&gt; what would have been its first tranche of cash subsidies. One likely reason for the company’s refusal to negotiate, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year, is that the process to amend the contract would entail admitting it was not going to manufacturer LCDs and disclosing in detail what its new plan, which it did not have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBigUe"&gt;But Foxconn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189436/foxconn-wisconsin-lcd-factory-trump-contract-negotiation"&gt;came back to the table&lt;/a&gt;, and the result is this amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT6exi"&gt;The original contract effectively reimbursed Foxconn for 15 percent of its capital investment and 17 percent of its payroll provided it hit certain hiring targets each year. It was an outlandishly lucrative subsidy. If Foxconn built an expensive and highly automated factory that employed few workers, it could have come to about $1 million per job. In 2019, the economist Timothy Bartik compiled a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20747166/wisconsin-foxconn-deal-state-report-lcd-factory-innovation-centers"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the Evers administration that found Foxconn’s incentives would likely fall around $172,000 to $290,000 per job. Average US incentives are $24,000 per job, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sH2GXl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In exchange for the radically reduced subsidies, Foxconn gets flexibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLpqtO"&gt;The per-job subsidy under the amendment is around $41,000. The company would receive subsidies equal to up to 7 percent of wages and 10 percent of capital investment, which is in line with the state’s general &lt;a href="https://wedc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WEDC_ARED-FY20.pdf"&gt;Enterprise Zone&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRqOZb"&gt;In exchange for the radically reduced subsidies, Foxconn gets flexibility. The contract no longer specifies that Foxconn build an LCD facility. Instead, it defines the project as “economic investment activities related to locating and operating a technology and manufacturing ecosystem.” Foxconn Industrial Internet, a Foxconn subsidiary that came into Wisconsin after the LCD plan fell apart but did not count under the original contract, was also made eligible by the amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUQyPr"&gt;In a statement, the company thanked Evers and WEDC for finding an amendment “that will give Foxconn the flexibility to pursue business opportunities in response to changing global market conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjobfV"&gt;The company’s amendment application says the project “will include the construction and development of facilities for the manufacturing of data infrastructure and other operations related to high-performance computing, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.” But the company, as always, says it might also go on to pursue “new industries such as electric vehicle, digital health, and robotics using AI, semiconductor, and 5G technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ziql4L"&gt;It remains to be seen how &lt;a href="https://www.wpr.org/foxconns-next-challenge-fulfill-promises-made-racine-county-taxpayers"&gt;Mount Pleasant&lt;/a&gt; will fare given the project’s diminished scope. The town had committed to invest nearly $1 billion to acquire land and support the project, a sum so great it resulted in a credit downgrade. The state had pledged to cover 40 percent of its debt if taxes from the project fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK4URO"&gt;For Wisconsin and for Foxconn, the agreement marks an end to a costly and embarrassing saga. Foxconn’s failure had already ensured Wisconsin wouldn’t have to pay billions in tax subsidies, but the new deal means the Evers administration likely avoids the threat of a costly legal battle. After hundreds of millions in state funds were spent, dozens of people pushed from their homes to clear land, and years of grand promises followed by disappointment, the company will become just another manufacturer with a small regional presence. Perhaps its new status will allow Foxconn to finally figure out something to do in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2oD2u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are all the AirTag accessories we know about </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fYC-sV9f26gLYdwC4ya5f937KLY=/821x0:2261x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159412/airtag_accessories_header_202104.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afQCgp"&gt;The Apple AirTags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;have finally been announced&lt;/a&gt;, and with them come a ton of accessories to make them easier to use (so much easier than if it had, say, a built-in way to attach it to things). While a small tracking puck could be carried in a bag, there are a variety of other things that you may want to put an AirTag on that require some sort of holder or the judicious use of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aibtVD"&gt;These are all the accessories we could find that are either listed for preorder or have a page on Apple’s store. We don’t have official ship dates for most of them, but it’s probably a safe bet that the ones on the Apple Store will become available when the AirTags do, on April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zukTwfmRIxQklWUdl7oFS7ls-Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457924/HNPX2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Belkin’s AirTag holder. Tie it to anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pAbwNc"&gt;Belkin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RWmQC6"&gt;Belkin currently has two offerings, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPR2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHNPX2ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-secure-holder-with-strap%3Ffnode%3D4a11a0f92a3f82e2bc68e69e973caa245ea296126f6a1dea5da19b97d0d9b65242da69bc60433105cb23b3dcbfae194c6018f7a0e0a92d0ee1a81f4dc9a5d78ffd2ec296ae3f8902c56b9bb67e4de40bd67223cf08e2e2b4ddc7c848f910584ae10043f1f735c80aea4750706def61ce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a strap&lt;/a&gt;, which both sell for $12.95. Both products have a circular holder for the AirTag and come in white, black, blue, and pink. They’re currently listed as unavailable in Apple’s online store and as “coming soon” on Belkin’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I genuinely love this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lTlcNk"&gt;Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="678fYv"&gt;Nomad also offers its take on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-leather-keychain&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a keychain&lt;/a&gt;, but (characteristically) its version is a leather pouch that encases the AirTag. The company also has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fairtags-glasses-strap&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a glasses strap&lt;/a&gt;, which acts both as a strap to keep your glasses handy and as an AirTag holder in case you manage to misplace them. Both are listed for $39.95 but are marked down to $29.95 if you preorder, which you are able to do now on Nomad’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spigen’s rugged AirTag case. Maybe you could attach it to your rock climbing gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XGObNE"&gt;Cyrill / Spigen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IwxThP"&gt;Cyrill is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.cyrill.com/collections/airtag/products/black-airtag?variant=36909671776414"&gt;vegan leather keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; in two colors, black and “stone” (which is a light gray). It costs $19.99 and seems to be available now. Spigen, Cyrill’s parent company, is also offering its own AirTag cases: a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-valentinus%3Fvariant%3D32709738725423&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keychain accessory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spigen.com%2Fcollections%2Fapple-keynote%2Fproducts%2Fairtag-case-rugged-armor%3Fvariant%3D32709737971759&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a ruggedized case&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty clip connector (and what appears to be a bottle opener, though it’s not listed as a feature). Both are $24.99 — the keychain is available to order today, and the rugged case is available for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the bag charm. I dare you to put it on a Gucci or Louis purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kuvoxz"&gt;Hermès&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5fM4hd"&gt;Apple has a history with Hermès; the French luxury company made some jaw-droppingly expensive Apple Watch bands. True to form, the Apple Store lists a leather &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX872AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX8A2AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-luggage-tag%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;luggage tag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX862AM%2FA%2Fairtag-herm%25C3%25A8s-bag-charm%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bag charm&lt;/a&gt; made by Hermès — costing $349, $449, and $299 respectively. It is worth noting, though, that the accessories do include an AirTag with a custom “Hermès” engraving, so you can flex while you find. The key ring and bag charm come in orange, brown, and what looks like black but is listed as “bleu indigo.” The luggage tag is currently only shown in brown. Like Belkin’s offerings, they are currently unavailable through the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this One Infinite Loop? Nope, just Apple’s AirTag loop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p5SyxI"&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pqFTWr"&gt;Of course, Apple offers its own first-party accessories. Currently, Apple has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHJ23ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-leather-key-ring%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather key ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMX4A2ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-leather-loop%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather loop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0W3ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-loop%3Ffnode%3D232642819504aebff03bb7470b0ff950ae32a039afe8c3ea48212a87b560e67575c56ed76f20fa27ddcf08f907882b3a96f6c899909050607d95e6733392b73fcf15e79721673bff349549224cd612c4121172d3f147cf7c7dc16820d0044fc0894ea6b618566bf631d4821ab17ecf21&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22394331%2Fapple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;polyurethane (think Apple Watch sport band) loop&lt;/a&gt; listed on its store, coming in at $35, $39, and $29 respectively. All three are available in various colors and are currently listed as unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ENSzYI"&gt;Everybody else &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOHhl"&gt;Of course, with how long AirTags have been rumored, there were some manufacturers that wanted to get a head start with their accessories. Last night, we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393404/airtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile"&gt;various key rings show up on Walmart, Etsy, and eBay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the new iPad Pro with the M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad Pro 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9GZIA0Gfi4WQPK-l2mCpNu-xOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159356/ipadpro2021lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro&lt;/em&gt; | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUYWLh"&gt;Apple announced a 2021 refresh to its iPad Pro lineup, which now includes the same powerful and efficient M1 processor that’s in its MacBook Air, Pro, and Mac mini computers. Both the new 11-inch and 12.9-inch models will feature the chip, as well as a Thunderbolt port and optional 5G support. The display on the larger tablet has received a particularly big boost, jumping to a Liquid Retina XDR Mini LED screen. My colleague Monica Chin has gone deeper on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;more of this year’s big improvements&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m just here to tell you when you’ll be able to buy them and how much it might cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB5ppe"&gt;Before the pandemic, it was common for preorders to begin shortly after a product’s announcement. Alas, things have changed. If you have your eye on the new iPad Pro, you’ll need to come back on Friday, April 30th, to place your order. (The links below currently lead to the correct pages on Apple’s site, but there won’t be any “buy” buttons available.) The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799 for 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi connectivity. The model with LTE and 5G support costs $200 more. If you want the big 12.9-inch iPad Pro, that model starts at $1,099 and comes with 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLBAcP"&gt;Your purchase won’t ship until the second half of May. That doesn’t mean you can’t take a gander at Apple’s site right now to see all of the specs and configure the iPad Pro of your dreams. We’ll update this post once the buying links are live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iArXoZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10456970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UWdJ8G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10456977"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
