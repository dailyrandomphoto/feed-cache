    <title>Nintendo thinks the Switch is well-placed for post-pandemic life</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdScAf"&gt;The Switch is nearly five years old and facing increased competition from new and powerful consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But despite all of this, Nintendo’s E3 2021 presentation this week was arguably the highlight of this year’s event — even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456160/new-nintendo-switch-release-date-september-e3-announcement"&gt;the long-rumored Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt; failed to make an appearance. Nintendo showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;the much-anticipated sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;revealed that the mythical &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; is launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;, and peppered in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535127/advance-wars-1-and-2-re-boot-camp-nintendo-direct-e3-2021"&gt;a handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535212/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-ii-links-awakening-game-watch-handheld-release-date"&gt;of other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535183/mario-party-superstars-warioware-nintendo-direct-e3"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt; to excite fans. As always, the company continued to exist in its own world, divorced from the technological rat race that typically defines these debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrzPt0"&gt;In fact, the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X appears to have had very little impact on Nintendo, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;the Switch is selling as well as ever&lt;/a&gt;. Doug Bowser, president of Nintendo of America, believes the reason is simple: there’s still nothing else like the Switch on the market. While he notes that new console launches “bodes well for the industry,” Bowser tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hybrid nature of the Switch means it still occupies “a unique position” that differentiates itself from more traditional consoles. And it’s a proposition that has proven to be surprisingly enduring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgEoHP"&gt;As with most gaming companies, the past year has been both a challenge and an opportunity for Nintendo. With everyone stuck at home, many turned to games like &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; as a form of escape or social interaction. The pandemic meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;more people were playing games&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;conversely that games were more challenging to develop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kn6gn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the teams have adapted very well.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1A4Ytp"&gt;“We’ve seen video games really grow in terms of the number of people playing, and the amount of time that they’re playing overall,” Bowser says. “For us at Nintendo, our focus first and foremost has been keeping our employees safe, and ensuring that we’re providing safe environments for them to work within. And while there have been some challenges, what I can say is I think the teams have adapted very well, and it’s allowed us to be effective in the various environments where we may be working overall. I think the lineup that you’ve seen so far this calendar year bodes well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Owe0L9"&gt;Outside of an increased appetite for games, he says that there have also been some changes in player behavior during the pandemic. For starters, there’s been a change in who is playing games on the Switch. “Demographics are changing,” Bowser says. That includes more casual players, as well as more women playing on the Switch. (Bowser previously noted a similar audience expansion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20951926/nintendo-doug-bowser-interview-switch-lite-sales-3ds-support-consoles"&gt;when the Switch Lite launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) Unsurprisingly, those new players are also spending a lot of time using online features. “&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; again fueled a lot of that,” says Bowser. “But it’s carried through and, for instance, even more recently &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; has been the source of a lot of online play overall for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYAU1v"&gt;He also adds that, despite its absence from the company’s E3 presentation, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; remains a big part of Nintendo’s future. “While we didn’t talk about it [during the E3 Nintendo Direct], we absolutely have plans going forward to ensure the 33 million people who have islands out there have new and fun activities to engage with,” Bowser says. “Look for more to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HejZBH"&gt;Looking ahead, it’s likely those behaviors will shift again, as various places open up and stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. Bowser believes this will be yet another advantage for Nintendo. “I think that’s going to be really important as we emerge from this pandemic, and people are looking to engage in other activities, hopefully travel, vacations, etc.,” he says. “Nintendo Switch is one of those devices that they can take with them as they embark on various travels. The positioning we still think is incredibly relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqHUM6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxZ4Mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2ia9X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super73 RX review: more dirt bike than e-bike</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Instant hype-beast status included&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="IkEgF3"&gt;The Super73 brand is instantly recognizable. With riders like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02iZ3FvRoc"&gt;Casey Neistat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackblack/status/1358219871880835073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358219871880835073%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Febiketips.road.cc%2Fcontent%2Fnews%2Fceleb-favourite-e-bike-brand-super73-raises-20m-plans-new-models-eyes-european-market"&gt;Jack Black&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7552987/Justin-Bieber-takes-new-electric-bicycle-ride-Beverly-Hills-neighborhood.html"&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt;, these souped up e-bikes have made a name for themselves as a trendy, future-ish way to get around. And I can confirm, in riding the latest Super73 model, the $3,500 RX, around NYC for over three weeks, it certainly attracts attention. It looks and rides more like a dirt bike than a bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TK0OxP"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Super73 v Juiced: Racing two extremely powerful e-bikes|102100" data-volume-uuid="9621959b1" data-volume-id="102100" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-199" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="9FUcds"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10610399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGtOkF"&gt;I logged nearly 200 miles on the Super73 in my three weeks with it. In short, I had a really great time cruising around on this bike. The Super73 RX has a 960 watt-hour battery that averaged 38 miles of range in Unlimited mode, the most motor-assisted of the four power modes. There are three other class modes in which RX can operate, including a full-pedal assist mode that Super73 claims can get you up to 75 miles of range. The included 5V charger can recharge the removable battery in three to four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfElpq"&gt;There is a small monochromatic, circular LCD display on the left side of the handlebars that shows speed, range, pedal assist strength, and total distance traveled on the bike. There is also an app that can send turn-by-turn directions to this screen. The app is relatively basic and I ended up never using it aside from setting the bike’s class to align with my local city and state guidelines. There is also a 600-lumen front light and a rear light that is brake-activated, even when the lights are switched off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4euLIxojaDdiObR14Z7KKtOVgqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662776/BFARSACE_210616_4636_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frame of the Super73 RX is made f﻿rom aircraft-grade 6165 and 7071 aluminum alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LLJlLy"&gt;The RX’s single rear DC hub motor’s pick up is gradual, but once you are in the 20mph range it can really kick up to its top speed of 32mph in a hurry, and it peaks at 2000 watts of power. There are front and rear shocks that allow for preload, compression, and rebound adjustments. And when paired with the large, custom five-inch wide Super73 tires, the bike cruises over bumps, cracks, and potholes with ease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojZAHX"&gt;I do wish the throttle was a bit harder to press. When going over a bump, my hand would jump a bit which caused my thumb to also jump on and off the throttle and therefore cut some of the power to the motor. It even proved painful when I was on some very dry paths and a quick, accidental acceleration sent me one way as the bike skidded out the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ZU28u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10609909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NxkFr"&gt;The frame of the Super73 RX is made from aircraft-grade 6165 and 7071 aluminum alloy. It feels very rugged. I kept a chain lock wrapped around the front of the frame, and even with it bouncing and slamming against the bike’s frame, no dents or scratches were left behind. There are also ample mounts for rigging accessories to almost any part of the frame and fenders on both tires. And there are a mess of wires on the front, semi-hidden behind a plastic plate, that then run through the frame to keep the whole bike looking clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztK2pp"&gt;All of these premium materials add up to a lot of weight. The RX is 80lbs of bike that you absolutely feel when you’re not using the hub motor to power it. I can’t imagine owning this bike and having to move it up any number of stairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQCCoC"&gt;I took the RX on a few dirt paths in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, and this is really where you can feel the power of that 2,000-watt motor and front and rear suspension. There is very little this bike won’t go over or up. But again, this is where the RX feels more like an electric dirt bike than a bicycle and where being able to handle 80lbs of bike might get rough if you don’t know what you’re doing. With the low handlebars and pushed-back seat position, the RX doesn’t make for a comfortable pedaling experience either, and using this bike in pedal assist mode only is very uncomfortable.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; But when using just the throttle, the bike feels really powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8o1jQhetCEJfrFl7OTyInTNz_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662967/BFARSACE_210616_4636_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RX weighs 80lbs and rides like an electric dirt bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnAHEcVJOmr2yFOLC4T96YxxqsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662774/BFARSACE_210616_4636_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The taillight is brake activated even when the running lights are powered off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FBbxWAqNEYFoQhALRaHadnyigo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662771/BFARSACE_210616_4636_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I installed $15 metal pegs for a second passenger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bA0m6z"&gt;The Super73 RX is as great to look at as it is to ride, and at $3,500 it better be. But its lack of built-in anti-theft features caused me great anxiety here in NYC. This bike is a total showstopper and therefore quite desirable. When parking it on the street, I would remove the 11.2-pound battery with the included key then lock it up using both a chain lock and U-lock. Even then, I would still be nervous about someone running away with it. I wish Super73 offered better theft protection options out of the box, like VanMoof, or made the bike only able to be powered via a key, like Juiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV5RxB"&gt;And while Super73 claims the battery can be recharged 1,000 times over, the one-year hardware warranty is confusing and currently most replacements parts are unavailable via the company’s site. It’s a big investment with little certainty that it will be easily repairable. But if you’re willing to risk all of that, and trust in the good parts Super73 uses on its e-bikes, then you will have an absolute blast busting around on this bike.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XEpuLmTimxX3s8MHN7vCY-g2D8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662775/BFARSACE_210616_4636_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super73’s RX comes with a 5V 2.8lb charger that is capable of charging the 960Wh battery in three to four hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I4fucLtCz7ETshoIdS3tGvjdnS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662773/BFARSACE_210616_4636_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a small screen on the left side of the handlebars that shows speed, range, pedal assist strength, total distance traveled on the bike, and turn-by-turn directions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0S7e5"&gt;Super 73’s RX is just as fun for running errands as it is to take on the trails, that is if you’re not pedaling and instead using the thumb throttle. It feels solid underneath you and can kick up to high speeds for long periods of time on a single charge. But this e-bike is far less of a peddling bike and way more of a throttle bike, which can be hard to get used to if you are coming from a biking background or looking to get any form of exercise while riding. It is also one of the more expensive models of e-bike within this spec range, so it will be important to have a clear purpose before investing in this electric dirt bike.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony opens PS5 beta program ahead of next major system update</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gtoASn"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; has received a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383288/sony-ps5-update-hdr-options-120hz-pc-monitor-support-features"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; feature updates since it launched in late 2020, but &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/17/sign-up-for-the-first-ps5-system-software-beta-program/"&gt;Sony shared today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s prepping to roll out a major system update later this year — and it wants you to test it first. You can register for it’s “first-ever” beta to try the new console software if you’re over 18 and live in the US, Canada, Japan, UK, Germany, or France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTYljR"&gt;Sony isn’t yet sharing what new features are coming in the beta, but it’ll divulge details in the coming weeks, it says. Could it be that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;PS5’s long-awaited M.2 SSD slot will get switched on&lt;/a&gt; for additional speedy storage, or will the console finally get variable refresh rate and 1440p support? You can already tell that I’m expecting a lot out of this incoming update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tn0f2t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/8/13561008/microsoft-xbox-insider-program"&gt;Microsoft has allowed Xbox gamers to opt in&lt;/a&gt; to test upcoming software releases for years through its Insider program, and it’s usually where the company debuts visual updates to its dashboard and other under-the-hood features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvlbYw"&gt;If you’re interested, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps5/ps5-beta-program-sign-up"&gt;you can sign up here&lt;/a&gt;, though you’ll need to be signed in with your PlayStation ID to register. Sony says that signing up for this beta means you’ll be considered for future beta releases. Anyone who opts into the beta can still restore their system to the latest official release before the testing phase ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE5NeA"&gt;As always, there are risks involved with signing up to test beta software. The system might not behave normally in some cases, and you may want to double-check that all of your game saves are backed up — either locally or to the cloud via your PS Plus account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEHy1D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkoXe0"&gt;Just ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has begun its annual back-to-school promotion, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538235%2Fapple-sale-airpods-macbook-ipad-anker-microsoft-surface-duo-android-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free AirPods when you purchase an eligible Mac or iPad&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a similar deal to last year’s offer, where the standard AirPods are offered by default, but at checkout you can upgrade to the model that includes the wireless charging case for $40, or the AirPods Pro for an extra $90. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmcEdD"&gt;As for what devices are eligible for the free AirPods on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538235%2Fapple-sale-airpods-macbook-ipad-anker-microsoft-surface-duo-android-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s education site&lt;/a&gt;, it starts with the $499 iPad Air (latest gen with USB-C), moving up to the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1-touting iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. On the macOS side of things, Apple is offering AirPods with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; (13 or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Intel-based 16-inch model&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;the new iMac&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the previous-gen 21.5- or 27-inch models), and finally, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfjbFn"&gt;There aren’t an abundance of reputable tech accessory brands on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;with RavPower being among the latest to be delisted for fraudulent reviews&lt;/a&gt;. But Anker products are still available, and some of them are even discounted today. In this assortment, there are portable power banks, power banks that are also wall adapters, a wireless charger, Lightning cable bundles, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jSIUhd"&gt;Moving on to other deals, the unlocked version of Microsoft’s Surface Duo is still seeing fantastic price drops at Amazon. The folding phone with 256GB of storage (and compatibility with Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J3N1R8C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $732&lt;/a&gt;, down from $1,500. It costs about $50 less for the model with 128GB of storage. Frustratingly, the Surface Duo is still on Android 10 software, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366636/microsoft-surface-duo-android-updates-three-years-support-security"&gt;Microsoft promised three years of OS and security updates after launch&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you believe they’ll follow through or not, it could still be a good option for you if you want to multitask to your heart’s content or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450941/microsoft-surface-duo-xbox-mobile-xcloud-cloud-gaming-dual-screen"&gt;do a bit of handheld xCloud gaming on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Veq2vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10497909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wsdbHH"&gt;I alluded to it earlier, but Prime Day 2021 is coming up fast, happening Monday, June 21st just after Father’s Day. We’re busy behind the scenes getting things ready, but we put together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"&gt;a list of the best early deals&lt;/a&gt; that you can get right now — but only if you have a Prime membership. As you might expect, these deals focus mostly on Amazon’s own products, but definitely keep an eye out for new deals first thing next week, which will feature price cuts for way more brands. Here’s a tease of the best early deals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T1ruPM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Why it took Nintendo 15 years to make Metroid Dread</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwWJc6esQdATmsHXiZJSjhJrjSs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465956/MD_Movie_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wc7Lyy"&gt;Around 15 years ago, Yoshio Sakamoto had an idea for the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; game. Called &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;, the game would feature longtime protagonist Samus Aran constantly pursued by some kind of all-powerful force. The idea was to instill fear in players with an enemy they couldn’t defeat. This was the same time that the Nintendo DS was becoming a breakout hit, but Sakamoto soon realized that the handheld wasn’t powerful enough for his ideas. “It was difficult to realize that concept with that hardware,” he said recently during a meeting with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1t0lec"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:645329"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5uYF6d"&gt;Development on &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; stopped and started a few times due to these technical limitations, before eventually being shelved indefinitely. “We had put it on hold,” Sakamoto explains. Which is what made this year’s announcement at E3 such a surprise: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;not only is &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; real&lt;/a&gt;, it’s coming to the Switch on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGr5Qo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; is the fifth main entry in the franchise — it was initially titled &lt;em&gt;Metroid 5&lt;/em&gt; during the E3 reveal — and the first since &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt; in 2002. Like its predecessors, it’s a 2D side-scroller that combines action and exploration. Not only will Samus have to fight off hostile aliens but also find her way through a labyrinth-like planet full of secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO2But"&gt;The main twist are new robots called E.M.M.I., predatory creatures that Samus isn’t strong enough to fight, forcing her to hide. They add an almost horror-like element to the game; Samus will have to be silent around them and can make use of technologies like a cloaking field to remain invisible. “I wanted to create something that was unsettling for players, and also would communicate this unfeeling-ness that’s inherent in something that’s robotic,” Sakamoto says of the machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tfAAUd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NjCICl7dDo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nVh7fd"&gt;Sakamoto is serving as producer on &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt;, and he says that the time was finally right for a few reasons. One was more powerful hardware in the form of the Switch. The other is a partner. In 2017, Nintendo launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291350/metroid-samus-returns-review-nintendo-3ds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt; on the 3DS&lt;/a&gt;, a remake of the Game Boy title &lt;em&gt;Metroid II&lt;/em&gt;. Development was handled primarily by Spanish studio Mercury Steam. “The reason that I actually met with them was in the hope that they’d be able to realize the concepts that I had for &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread,&lt;/em&gt;” Sakamoto explains. “In meeting with them, I got the sense that they were a team that we could work together with towards a singular concept, and realize this goal that I had in mind for &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwrFva"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dread&lt;/em&gt; features 2D gameplay with 3D visuals, as well as much more fluid movement compared to earlier &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; games. Samus is quick and nimble, able to slide around and use counterattacks. She even has free aim like in &lt;em&gt;Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;. Meanwhile, from the live gameplay demo I watched, the E.M.M.I. robots are appropriately terrifying, hunting down Samus with cold, calculated precision. For Sakamoto, watching it all come together so smoothly has almost made the long wait to realize his vision worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYXm75"&gt;“It’s really better than I imagined those 15 years ago when I had the idea for this,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will let developers put their apps inside its TikTok copycat Spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_9d6CHauSkcnDmMT1QVI7bNLDk=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465949/snapchatspotlight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7VtyQ"&gt;Snapchat is making it easier for developers to use viral content to directly promote their apps. Today, it’s launching Creative Kit for Spotlight, which will allow app developers to give users the power to publish directly to Snapchat’s TikTok rival, Spotlight. At the same time, Snapchat users can browse content made on those apps and then easily navigate to download them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJjdxo"&gt;It’s a win-win for both parties: Snapchat gains more content on its platform while developers are rewarded with additional downloads if an effect or tool they launch goes viral. Developers can also set up hashtag topics that’ll tag this content, so they can track how well it’s doing, and viewers can see everything made with that effect. Snap says it won’t take any sort of cut from developers, even if their app requires a purchase to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzEYhj"&gt;Initial partners include Videoleap and Beatleap by &lt;a href="https://www.lightricks.com/"&gt;Lightricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsplice.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22536936%2Fsnapchat-spotlight-app-developers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Splice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://powder.gg/"&gt;Powder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/pinata-farms/id1461925824"&gt;Piñata Farms&lt;/a&gt;, among others. All these apps involve creation tools, and clearly, this is so people discover the app on the content it helped make — a real advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTYZ1z"&gt;Although this is just the start of apps using Snapchat as a distributor, it has the potential to send a sizable number of downloads their way — just like how Snapchat’s user base tends to pop when a particular filter goes viral. In 2019, Snap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707569/snapchat-snap-earnings-users-added-filter-gender-swap"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; between 7 and 9 million users joined its platform because of viral face filters, like one that made them look like babies. That same thing could happen for an app, which, in the long term, could change the dynamics between developers and traditional app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Fluid Office documents are coming to life in Teams, OneNote, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ba8QvcvFMbXrEmdbDbWkBzYONsk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465948/acastro_200514_4022_microsoftFluid_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9LFEtR"&gt;The biggest change to Microsoft’s Office documents in decades is coming to life soon, as the company’s Fluid framework arrives in Microsoft Teams, OneNote, Outlook, and Whiteboard. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;first unveiled Fluid&lt;/a&gt; last year, showing how the framework allows blocks of Office content to live independently across the web. That idea is now becoming a reality, with collaborative content that can be copied, pasted, and shared with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sb75Gu"&gt;Instead of tables, graphs, and lists that are static and bound to specific documents, Fluid components are collaborative modules that exist across different applications. They will begin showing up in Microsoft Teams first this summer, embeddable in meetings and chats. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOQkf-KVaQ-0GX0WqpULlkzyB8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664522/fluidcomponents.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Fluid components roam across multiple apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gyaHIc"&gt;The launch of Fluid documents coincides with employees returning to their offices and the rise of a new hybrid work experience. “We were excited about going hard and fast with Fluid, and then the pandemic hit,” says Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;So we largely put a lot of our energy onto Teams, and we think of Teams as the scaffolding that creates the connection, but now as we move back to hybrid, we increasingly believe we need more innovation in what I call the canvas that gets collaboration done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBlmxa"&gt;What Microsoft has created with Fluid is the biggest change to Office in decades. While Fluid seemed like a great future-facing concept &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;during its reveal last year&lt;/a&gt;, watching Microsoft demonstrate it this week has really highlighted how transformative this could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohD5Fs"&gt;Every Microsoft Teams meeting will soon come with a built-in notes experience that’s collaborative. Notes will show up within a Teams meeting or in an Outlook calendar, and anyone on the invite can just start typing away in real time. If you add a task, it immediately syncs to your other tasks across Microsoft 365, and the meeting notes are automatically synced to your Outlook calendar where you can also edit them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m-Mvc1AQlk-IDKrHBQuq6ezIN6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664532/fluidbeforemeetings.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fluid will work in meeting agendas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jyuvTT"&gt;“We want collaboration to be able to start before the meeting starts, so as soon as the invite goes out,” explains Ron Pessner, a director of program management working on Fluid at Microsoft. As the meeting notes in this particular example are live and real time, you can even copy them into an app like OneNote and you’ll still see everyone making edits to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GHDGk"&gt;This living Fluid component has the potential to shift how everyone gets work done across Microsoft Teams and Office. It’s impressively quick, with no sync time, just like Google Docs. Microsoft has had similar collaboration tools in Office for a while now, but they’ve been restricted to static documents and nothing on this level of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ncr52R"&gt;“We’re going to be launching the components in Teams this summer,” says Pessner. The meeting notes experience will be available in preview later this year, alongside some tests integrating it into the desktop version of Outlook. It’s likely as we see Fluid components roll out, they’ll appear first in Teams and on the web parts of Office before making their way to desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQqnZYP4C1iz0drlHdTI6W8v9tM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664518/Whiteboard.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s updated Whiteboard app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q6M4Yn"&gt;Microsoft is also transforming its Whiteboard app into a canvas to host Fluid components. Whiteboard has long existed as Microsoft’s first big collaborative tool, and this summer it’s being overhauled with the help of Fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZDfKy"&gt;New collaboration cursors will appear in Whiteboard, letting you see coworkers’ additions to a document in real time. There’s even a new virtual laser pointer that you can use to get people’s attention, or reaction stickers to make the Whiteboard canvas feel a little more alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cWUVpO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/np9Tl-VcH3Q?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdJHrD"&gt;Fluid components like tables or task lists can also be embedded into Whiteboard, and the entire app will now look and feel the same across all devices and platforms. With Whiteboard, you could almost use the app as a dashboard to watch colleagues editing Fluid components in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IMPOC"&gt;This is just the start of Fluid making its way to Microsoft 365, and we’re bound to see more over the course of this year and beyond. It will be particularly interesting to see how Microsoft integrates Fluid more deeply into both Teams and Outlook, the main communications tools used by businesses that rely on the Office suite. If Microsoft gets the integration of Fluid right, it will forever change the way documents are created, shared, and, ultimately, how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RFUbPw"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;teasing its vision&lt;/a&gt; for the future of Teams meetings recently, and it’s now committing to making parts of it a reality this year. Front row is the official name for the new Microsoft Teams layout, which includes methods designed to bridge the hybrid work gap between those physically present in a meeting and remote participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5utVq"&gt;“Visually, this new layout moves the video gallery to the bottom of the screen so in-room participants can see remote colleagues face to face across a horizontal plane–similar to if they were in the same room,” explains Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gM2CgqjJwtxx1bfk7hkVqUpJQws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22664544/New_Teams_Rooms_Video_Layout_Lets_People_Participate_on_Equal_Footing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front row is designed to improve hybrid work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rAaxH"&gt;Microsoft will be using its new Fluid components to power this layout, with things like agenda, tasks, and notes all collaborative and updated in real time. The meeting chat will also be highly visible in this view, giving everyone equal footing to participate in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5OS25"&gt;Alongside this new view, Microsoft is also tweaking how it manages video calls in Teams. New video layouts for Teams Rooms will utilize the larger screen real estate of monitors and screens typically found in meeting rooms to highlight remote participants more clearly. A similar redesign is coming to Teams on Surface Hub, too. A new meeting canvas with chat bubbles, live reactions, and all the latest Teams features will enter preview later this month for Surface Hub owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDKsbm"&gt;Microsoft Teams will also be updated with the new Whiteboard design that’s coming this summer. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22302185"&gt;read more about Microsoft’s Fluid components and Whiteboard plans here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India’s healthcare workers are busting misinformation on WhatsApp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ttzzm3wuoMqEwI-XTZfZfXSC5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465999/VRG_4629_IMG_5013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bharti Kamble putting up a WhatsApp status on the temperature range of the human body.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The backbone of India’s rural healthcare system is now tasked with beating back COVID-19 myths, one message at a time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6KC1F3"&gt;Bharti Kamble is on the lookout for fake messages related to COVID-19. Late in the afternoon, she carefully reads over 500 messages from eight WhatsApp groups. As she finishes her search, she’s relieved. “For 30 days now, I didn’t come across a single piece of misinformation as WhatsApp forward,” she says. But after a year spent fighting misinformation, Kamble remains wary. “It’s still too early to declare a victory,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPY9Jd"&gt;Kamble is an accredited social health activist (ASHA worker), the foot soldier of India’s rural healthcare system. When she started work as an ASHA, she never thought she’d be fact-checking hundreds of messages every week. Selected under India’s National Health Mission, ASHA workers are women who care for about 1,000 people within their village. They are tasked with at least 50 responsibilities, some of which include providing medicines for common ailments like coughs or fevers, maintaining over 73 different community health records, counseling on birth preparedness, ensuring antenatal and postnatal care, arranging for immunizations, providing contraception, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXmLmw"&gt;Kamble is the ASHA worker for the 701 people living in the remote village of Bolakewadi in Western India’s Maharashtra state. In some ways, they’ve been lucky during the pandemic — the village hasn’t reported a single COVID case. It is astonishing because over 50 percent of villagers regularly migrate 285 miles north to India’s financial capital Mumbai, a city that became a COVID hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CIhHL4nRX9CEBoOt0fOf4zqr_AI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660962/VRG_4629_IMG_4888.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are many remote villages with no internet connectivity. ASHA workers Mandakini Kodak and Rekha Dorugade trek over six miles to reach a remote village — making people aware of the vaccination drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5N84kd"&gt;Starting in March 2020, nearly &lt;a href="http://nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/Update%20on%20ASHA%20Programme_2019_for%20Web.pdf"&gt;1 million&lt;/a&gt; ASHA workers across 600,000 Indian villages were&lt;a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/ModelMicroplanforcontainmentoflocaltransmissionofCOVID19.pdf"&gt; tasked&lt;/a&gt; with containing the community transmission of coronavirus. They survey their populations to find suspected COVID cases, monitor patients’ oxygen and temperature levels daily, contract-trace, ensure patients complete their quarantine period, and help them get medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2dKYm"&gt;Their daunting task is complicated by misinformation, which spreads like wildfire on social media platforms. While surveying in March 2021, Kamble found a woman in her 80s with heavy fever and fatigue. “Why didn’t you take paracetamol tablets from me?” Kamble asked. The old woman replied, “What if you would have given my name to your seniors [supervisors], asking me to quarantine? I heard that fasting and praying to God alleviates the fever.” It was the third day of her fasting. Without any delay, Kamble gave her packets of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and paracetamol tablets. “Within four days, she felt better,” Kamble said, but her task was far from over. Kamble began investigating and found that “fasting cures COVID” was a misinformation message forwarded multiple times in the vernacular language Marathi on village WhatsApp groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="an883l"&gt;Kamble, who is a part of over eight such groups, immediately messaged that fasting is no cure for COVID-19. She explained the science behind a proper diet and the importance of modern medicines. She wanted to make sure that no one else tried to fast away a fever. “We didn’t get training on busting misinformation. We learned on the job and with interactions from the people,” she says. She may not have had any formal training, but Kamble’s had plenty of practice over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kLaKig7xCHlUVNWMuoKw7AJ88-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660960/VRG_4629_IMG_4853.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandakini Kodak makes notes on misinformation spread in the community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2Dlu3"&gt;Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, India has tested positive for pseudoscience and misinformation, leading to a surge in cases. India reported over 29 million cases, with more than 353,000 people succumbing to the virus as of June 9th, 2021, with experts stating that this figure remains a massive&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/25/world/asia/india-covid-death-estimates.html"&gt; undercount&lt;/a&gt;. Several leaders of the elected far-right Bharatiya Janata Party have been vocal about drinking cow urine to prevent COVID, with a few even making&lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/bjp-mla-bairia-surendra-singh-cow-urine-gaumutra-to-stop-covid19-on-camera-1800129-2021-05-08"&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlCteq"&gt;Last year, its leaders organized a gaumutra (cow urine) drinking&lt;a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/03/18/volunteer-falls-ill-after-drinking-cow-urine-bjp-leader-arrested-for-hosting-party.html"&gt; event&lt;/a&gt;. Kamble came across several such messages. “What do you even say to something like that? A lot of people in fact did try it.” She started sourcing scientific messages from doctors and began messaging about COVID treatments that actually worked. “If you directly counter misinformation saying it’s wrong, then people don’t listen and start provoking you,” she explains. Instead, her antidote is disseminating scientific information in the easiest possible way. Eventually, she says, people realized cow urine is no cure for COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkrr3o"&gt;Kamble isn’t the only ASHA worker using WhatsApp to curb misinformation. Netradipa Patil, an ASHA and leader of over 3,000 ASHAs from Kolhapur’s Shirol region, found that every family member in her surveying area of 1,000 people has at least one smartphone. “When we distributed COVID awareness pamphlets, people threw them [away]. That’s when I decided to act smartly.” When she saw instances of fake news and misinformation, she made a hyperlocal WhatsApp group with 200-plus members. “When unscientific messages go viral, I dial up at least three COVID doctors and confirm all the facts,” she says. She then types out messages, makes videos, and forwards newspaper clippings. This has taken a lot of her time but has helped save many lives. “In COVID’s second wave (March to June 2021), my area reported less than 10 cases and no deaths,” she says proudly. In contrast, Kolhapur district as a whole reported a case fatality rate of&lt;a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/kolhapur-reports-3-5-covid-fatality-rate-india-average-at-1-09-team-of-experts-rushed-to-district-9618261.html"&gt; 3.5 percent&lt;/a&gt; in May 2021 — one of the highest in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ESEiRoIf5QT0yto6LyL8ypPr6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663699/VRG_4629_IMG_5097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, Netradipa Patil formed a hyperlocal WhatsApp group where she consistently shares verified scientific information related to COVID-19 and its treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zi1ehC"&gt;By June 2020, Patil had mobilized other ASHAs to form similar groups. In addition to combating misinformation over WhatsApp, they also make an effort to bust misinformation during their surveys of their community so they can reach people without internet access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGIyYn"&gt;The situation became more urgent this spring. Starting on March 1st, 2021, India began its vaccination drive for citizens over the age of 60. ASHAs were to make a list of those citizens and submit it to the local civic authorities — but even gathering names became an uphill battle. “Senior citizens kept telling me that COVID vaccination is like slow poisoning. ‘Within six months of getting jabbed, we will die,’” Patil said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The misinformation that “India’s population has increased a lot and the Government is using vaccines to reduce it” spread rapidly. “It sounds funny, but it took two months of messaging and door-to-door visits to convince more than 90 percent of people to get vaccinated,” she recalls. Patil also shared her photo of getting jabbed and said, “I’ve taken both the doses, and I am alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxy5MH"&gt;Even after people get vaccinated, the job of ASHAs doesn’t end. In Kolhapur’s Pernoli village of 2,265 residents, two people died within a few days of the vaccination. This was a nightmare scenario for ASHA workers Mandakini Kodak and Rekha Dorugade. Suddenly, everyone in their village resisted vaccination. They probed these deaths and found both people were asthmatic and COVID positive — and that they hadn’t received reputable care. “They took injections and medicines from a quack. How can someone blame the vaccines then?” asks Kodak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_rWX9EhoJBtqjtVjz8GNUSgesI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660958/VRG_4629_IMG_4805.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several people from remote villages fear vaccination because of rampant misinformation. Often, people hide in their houses or run away when ASHA workers are out surveying the community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPsIxs"&gt;Often, misinformation is intertwined with superstitious beliefs. “Last year, several villagers refused to follow COVID protocol, saying that the village God won’t let Corona in,” remembers Kodak. Kamble faced something similar. As COVID cases kept increasing across the hinterlands, several villagers decided to swarm the local temple for a “community prayer.” Kamble started messaging that even if a single person tests COVID positive, it could lead to community transmission. She put infographics of COVID protocols as her WhatsApp status. “Faith is completely fine, but when it overpowers logic and science, it becomes a problem,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CVxdc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0bm6N7"&gt;ASHAs work in stifling conditions with inadequate safety gear and receive “performance-based incentives” based on the tasks completed. Despite working for over a decade, they aren’t recognized as full-time workers and average a monthly pay of $41 to $55 in Maharashtra. “We are busting misinformation, saving countless lives, and completing surveys on phones, yet the Government doesn’t even reimburse us for the internet,” says Patil. With poor pay, many ASHAs double up as farmworkers to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPHShV"&gt;Their limited resources aren’t well-understood in the communities they serve. Last year, a rumor began circulating on WhatsApp that said that for every COVID-19 patient detected, the Central Government would send money to local governments, Kodak says. This was not true. “The Government has no money to even buy hand gloves and sanitizers for us, how and why will they spend on detecting cases?” asks Kodak laughingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVorus"&gt;The ASHAs’ mission to contain COVID-19 outbreaks is often hampered by their poor-quality oximeters and infrared (IR) thermometers, provided by the government. While surveying, Maya Patil, an ASHA from Shirol, found her oximeter wouldn’t show any readings. There were problems with the oximeter’s display and quality. “It would show a reading only when indoors. Surveying inside the houses of containment zones with inadequate ventilation means risking life, but the Government doesn’t understand this, and [it refuses to give] us better-quality equipment,” she says. As a result of the faulty readings, many people refrain from getting their oxygen levels tested. “Many lives will be at risk if there’s a community transmission because of faulty equipment,” says Maya Patil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ATy8uznOpTVPFCWXL7sN6sMU8w0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660959/VRG_4629_IMG_4850.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A major hindrance to contact-tracing comes from the poor-quality oximeters and infrared thermometers provided to ASHAs by the government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xm5KB"&gt;Kamble experienced a similar problem from a 72-year-old woman. “Her oxygen level had dropped to 70. The family didn’t believe it and started verbally abusing me,” she says. The family started accusing Kamble of planning a conspiracy to send the old woman to the quarantine center. Somehow, she persuaded the family to consult a doctor. The patient’s oxygen level was diagnosed to be lower. “Less oxygen doesn’t always mean COVID, and people don’t even know what the normal oxygen level is,” Kamble says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zU6w5F"&gt;To educate the community and regain their trust, Kamble turned again to social media. She found a graphic representing the required oxygen level and put it up as a WhatsApp status. She sent the same photo to multiple WhatsApp groups, eventually reaching over 500 people directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0kvAU"&gt;“My inbox was flooded with replies, with some mentioning they had taken a screenshot as a reference, while others thanked me for making them aware of it,” she says. “The same family now asks me to monitor the oxygen level daily.” For something as simple as checking oxygen, Kamble was forced to spend several hours working to counter misinformation on WhatsApp. Now, she is facing off with senior health officials regarding the mediocre-quality equipment. Already, she has gotten several of her oximeters and IR thermometers replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoTAcw"&gt;It’s one of the triumphant stories ASHAs share about countering misinformation using technology. “There are many people who thank us for asking them to get vaccinated,” says Kodak. While some people in the area tested COVID positive, none were hospitalized, vindicating the ASHAs’ vaccination campaign. “It’s refreshing to listen to such stories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMUnoz"&gt;“Even if people disagree with our messages, they do read and discuss. While surveying, we spend at least three hours every day countering such misinformation,” Kamble says. While misinformation in her own village has slowed, the list of pseudoscientific messages continues ricocheting around WhatsApp groups in other areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tArK97"&gt;“One shouldn’t take a vaccine while menstruating”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39VxIv"&gt;“If you have taken the vaccine, you should avoid sunrays for a week”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uWCvp"&gt;“Snorting camphor powder increases your oxygen level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHOsqH"&gt;“Onion eaten with rock salt keeps away Corona.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DIS1v0"&gt;These are just a few of the hundreds of messages Kodak has received lately. She addresses every statement, often while working 10- to 12-hour days. “If I save someone, I will have done my job,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus original series will now release on Wednesdays, not Fridays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93AQehx-5obrd0f_ngOn1Guqw3g=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69465654/ARC_101_09922.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki was Disney’s first show to make the switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRRfKx"&gt;From July, all of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1084177/9358?subId1=VergeLoki&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ global original series will be released on Wednesdays rather than Fridays, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/disney-plus-shifts-original-series-to-wednesday-release-date-schedule-1234968809/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change has reportedly been made to give the service’s increasing number of original TV shows more space in the schedule, while the service’s original movies will continue to release on Fridays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFpaol"&gt;Disney has announced a number of new premiere dates following the change, with most now releasing a few days later than previously planned. &lt;em&gt;Monsters, Inc. &lt;/em&gt;spinoff &lt;em&gt;Monsters at Work &lt;/em&gt;for example, will now release on Wednesday, July 7th rather than July 2nd, while &lt;em&gt;Turner &amp;amp; Hooch&lt;/em&gt; has shifted from July 16th to Wednesday, July 21st. However a couple of series will now release earlier, like &lt;em&gt;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse &lt;/em&gt;batch two, which will now be available on July 28th (yes, a Wednesday) rather than July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QX5xjz"&gt;The first Disney Plus show to have premiered on a Wednesday was &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, which was reportedly the service’s most watched premiere. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421140/loki-disney-plus-show-new-date-wednesday"&gt;Wednesdays are the new Fridays,&lt;/a&gt;” actor Tom Hiddleston announced. That’s in contrast to previous series like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian, &lt;/em&gt;which released on Fridays in competition with Netflix and Amazon’s new releases. &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes that Fridays have historically been seen as the worst times to premiere new shows on linear TV networks.&lt;/p&gt;
