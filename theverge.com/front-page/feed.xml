    <title>Intel’s 12th Gen Core i9 doesn’t need Windows 11 for AMD beating boosts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60xUCgvsWK0suYcVzmNdg5qPOKA=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092872/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Intel’s latest chips fight back against AMD&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vrz1DY"&gt;Intel’s had a hard time competing with AMD lately. AMD’s Ryzen Zen 3 CPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;took the performance crown&lt;/a&gt; from Intel in gaming a year ago, and Intel’s response with its 11th Gen Core i9-11900K earlier this year was lackluster, to say the least. While it bumped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357949/intel-core-i9-11900k-review"&gt;some game performance&lt;/a&gt;, overall, it wasn’t enough to close the gap with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X in both performance and power consumption. Some reviewers even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxiuvQPL_qs"&gt;labeled it “pathetic”&lt;/a&gt; and a “waste of sand.” Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuSq4n"&gt;Intel’s 12th Gen arrives today and with it the flagship Core i9-12900K. It’s a new era of x86 processors that are designed similar to Apple’s ARM silicon in offering both performance and efficiency cores. This allows Windows to offload background tasks and keep the performance cores for the more demanding workloads. Intel is promising the usual “world’s best gaming processor” and a 19 percent performance improvement over its widely panned 11th Gen chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVnkE5"&gt;This new generation of Alder Lake chips also relies heavily on Windows 11. Microsoft has optimized its new OS for Intel’s Thread Director, supposedly allowing it to better manage tasks across these new CPU cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSgcFF"&gt;Intel promises better performance with Windows 11, but what does that actually mean in reality? Not much. I’ve spent the past week with the Core i9-12900K running on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, and there’s barely a difference between the two for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-HcvMrkDNlKb7rPlYumwt42LfQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957887/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Intel’s i9-12900K is slightly bigger than its predecessor. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="38116X"&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-12900K has a total of 16 cores, but they’re not the cores you’re used to. Intel has split them into eight performance P-cores and eight efficient E-cores. These performance cores are similar to Intel’s Core-class processors, with the efficiency ones more like its Atom-class cores. Clock speeds can reach up to 5.2GHz using Intel’s Turbo Max 3.0 technology, and there are 24 threads in total based on two threads per P-core and one thread for each E-core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RA7TQY"&gt;Intel is also offering DDR5 memory support for the first time and PCIe 5.0 support. This means you’ll need a new motherboard for Intel’s 12th Gen chips, as the company has moved to its new LGA 1700 socket and Z690 chipset here. You may even need a new cooler, or updated standoffs, as the 12900K is slightly larger than the 11900K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gJelu2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845366" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQFd9n"&gt;DDR5 will usher in an era of performance and power gains and even a new generation of overclocking with XMP 3.0. Intel’s Alder Lake CPUs also include Dynamic Memory Boost, which enables desktop PCs to automatically switch between faster XMP settings and a slower mode with less power consumption. It’s still enabled at a BIOS level, but you don’t even need DDR5 for this new memory boost feature. That’s good news, as DDR5 modules are likely to be expensive for some time yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PUV9H"&gt;While you can buy DDR5 memory right now, some Z690 motherboards will also support existing DDR4 modules to ease the transition. The introduction of PCIe 5.0 is mostly future-proofing right now, as you can’t buy a GPU that supports this standard, and we’re still waiting on the first PCIe 5.0 SSDs to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="6zBZ3d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10845374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5oBYQa"&gt;Still, you’re going to find a lot of Z690 motherboards with multiple M.2 slots. I’ve been testing MSI’s MAG Z690 Carbon Wi-Fi, which has five M.2 slots in total, with four at PCIe 4.0 speeds and one at PCIe 3.0. We’re now at the stage where just using M.2 for your storage needs is viable, even if it’s still not very affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oksbts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t review processors in the traditional sense, so we don’t own dedicated hardware testing rigs or multiple CPUs and systems to offer all of the benchmarks and comparisons you’d typically find in CPU reviews. For those, we’re going to recommend you visit the excellent folks at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/intels-alder-lake-big-little-cpu-design-tested-its-a-barn-burner/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/leo-waldock/intel-core-i9-12900k-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-12900k-i5-12600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer’s Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dK4WDQ"&gt;Yet, I’ve been testing Intel’s Core i9-12900K paired with 64GB of SK Hynix DDR5 4800 RAM and Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti. I’ve been holding off on the Windows 11 upgrade on my main gaming PC, so I wanted to see if it was really worthwhile for Intel’s latest Alder Lake chips. Spoiler: it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5cwV"&gt;I’ve tested a variety of workloads, synthetic benchmarks, and games across both Windows 10 and Windows 11, and the results are very similar. Performance improved slightly in some multithreaded tasks, but gaming was practically the same. Windows 11 does seem to favor Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro workloads, though. I was able to shave off mere seconds in 4K renders in general, and Puget Labs benchmarks are slightly higher on Windows 11 overall. We run a standard video export test at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which exports a 5-minute 4K video using Adobe Premiere Pro. This completed in 3 minutes and 14 seconds on Windows 11, which was 8 seconds faster than when I exported using Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q3vE63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10845364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80SQtt"&gt;In gaming, frame rates are mostly unchanged between Windows 10 and Windows 11. I tested &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; all at 1080p with ultra or high settings. Performance was practically identical across all these titles, apart from &lt;em&gt;Gears 5,&lt;/em&gt; where it dipped slightly on Windows 11. A benchmark for 3DMark Time Spy CPU also dipped slightly on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEzpcw"&gt;There are bound to be improvements with Intel’s Thread Director on Windows 11 that are more noticeable when you’re running a lot of background tasks or just in regular day-to-day usage, but I wasn’t able to notice them during my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99DANU"&gt;I also tested a variety of PCIe 4.0 drives with the 12900K, just to see how capable it is at delivering the speeds you’d expect to see with the latest M.2 SSDs. Western Digital’s SN850 (1TB) is rated at 7,000MB/s sequential read speeds and 5,000MB/s write speeds. I recorded read speeds of 6,925MB/s and write speeds of 5,362MB/s. That’s only slightly better (less than 2 percent) than what I saw with Intel’s previous Core i9-11900K. Samsung’s 980 Pro also managed to hit read speeds of 6,706MB/s and write speeds of 4,977MB/s, all using CrystalDiskMark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GATiEbwzWOqjUaLgDvXO5g7fZh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985227/HsBrxHu.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s SN850 performs well with the 12900K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVviRe"&gt;These types of speeds don’t mean much on paper, but in reality, I was able to do tasks like transfer 100GB of data between two PCIe 4.0 drives, all while exporting a 4K video without my PC bottlenecking or breaking a sweat. I use my PC for gaming and work, so it’s great to be able to leave a data transfer running in the background while I instantly load a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1Awo5"&gt;The Core i9-12900K also delivers big improvements on multi-core performance for benchmarks like Geekbench 5 and Cinebench R23. Intel’s previous 11900K dropped its core count to eight, compared to the 10900K’s 10 cores, and it suffered in multi-core performance as a result. In Geekbench 5, the 12900K was nearly 12 percent better than the 11900K in single-thread performance and a massive 137 percent improvement in multi-core performance. I also noticed Geekbench 5 performing worse on Windows 11 here. Likewise, the Cinebench R23 scores are a big improvement over the 11900K and even push past what you’d find from AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_xCcCodcpDa8ZoE6uWXm3qUfEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957888/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel is using a new Z690 chipset with its 12th Gen chips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaAtp"&gt;In terms of the AMD competition, Intel is finally delivering performance that can outperform AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X. The 12900K is a big improvement over the 11th Gen 11900K, in both productivity workloads and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vg4LQl"&gt;The 12900K beats AMD’s 5950X in practically all of &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-12900k-i5-12600k-review"&gt;Eurogamer’s tests&lt;/a&gt; and nearly all of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhI9tLOg-6I"&gt;Gamer Nexus’ comprehensive benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;. CPU reviewers have found that this performance comes at an additional price beyond the sticker, though. At full loads for certain tasks, the 12900K can draw more than 240 watts of power, compared to AMD’s stock 120W for the 5950X, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fhI9tLOg-6I"&gt;according to Gamers Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkbsfZ"&gt;It has taken a year for Intel to respond, with a $589 processor that can match AMD’s $799 Ryzen 9 5950X. Whether you’ll actually be able to find it for $589 is another question, though. Pricing at various retailers in the US ranges from $620 all the way up to $649 right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDH3bT"&gt;Just how long Intel can maintain its performance advantage remains to be seen. AMD is rumored to be launching its Ryzen 6000 processors early next year, and they could be a stop-gap until the company is ready with its next Zen 4 architecture. For now, Intel is back and ready to usher in the DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 era.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House vaccine and testing mandate doesn’t start until after the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHJtuPgu1P2znQK-kgn-NKW3TIE=/127x0:5802x3783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092722/1232342354.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjBATH"&gt;The Biden administration on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/04/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-details-of-two-major-vaccination-policies/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a rule that requires private businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 on at least a weekly basis. This new push to bump vaccination rates comes after the White House set a rule requiring &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/federal-contractors-will-have-broad-flexibility-to-enforce-covid-vaccine-rules.html"&gt;federal contractors&lt;/a&gt; to establish plans ensuring their employees are vaccinated against COVID-19.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlHQLW"&gt;The new rule (&lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23643.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) was drafted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a &lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/workers/"&gt;government subagency&lt;/a&gt; under the US Department of Labor that covers about 84 million private-sector employers and workers. It requires that employers provide paid time for employees to go get vaccinated and ensure all unvaccinated workers wear a face mask at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ApcYu9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two thirds of all US workers will be covered by vaccination rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KXoJn"&gt;A second policy announced today by the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services adds a requirement for full vaccination of health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid, affecting some 17 million workers at more than 76,000 facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aM123K"&gt;There’s one deadline set for the federal contractor, OSHA, and CMS policies when it comes to vaccination: January 4th, 2022. Other requirements for employers, like providing paid time off for vaccination and masking for unvaccinated employees, take effect starting December 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpjAHl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22600423/vaccine-mandates-federal-state-google-facebook"&gt;Many private businesses&lt;/a&gt; — including Google, Meta (formerly Facebook), and hospitals across the country — have already required their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to the new rule. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-workers-face-layoffs-us-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-kick-2021-10-19/"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; small numbers of employees who refused the rules, creating additional issues for those struggling with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/10/16/hospital-covid-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;supposed&lt;/a&gt; labor &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/nyregion/nyc-police-vaccine-mandate.html"&gt;shortages&lt;/a&gt;.  An &lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/ets2/faqs"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for the Emergency Temporary Standard announced today notes it is a “minimum requirement” and says, “Nothing in this section prevents employers from agreeing with their employees to implement additional measures, and this section does not displace collectively bargained agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1rSPI"&gt;The White House vaccine mandate for federal contractors has been met with criticism from state governments claiming that this rule is unconstitutional. Nineteen states have filed lawsuits against the federal government, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-health-lawsuits-missouri-99fb3b040661c71ddde1ded37a2f5b87"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;reported in October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ2gNG"&gt;The two joint and two individual lawsuits argue that the mandate&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;violates the states’ Tenth Amendment rights and forces states to comply with federal law without intermission. According to the administration, “both OSHA and CMS are making clear that their new rules preempt any inconsistent state or local laws, including laws that ban or limit an employer’s authority to require vaccination, masks, or testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0PMDH"&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the United States have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the US has the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/world/asia/us-vaccination-rate-low.html"&gt;lowest vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; among wealthy democracies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The secrets of the first real smartphone, with Dieter Bohn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pB7XzuuQ2W_dyBR9idwQ47ncnxY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092618/Springboard_Thumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Our new documentary now streaming on your TV&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7F1VU7"&gt;You may have read on the site that &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn has been working on a documentary called &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone. &lt;/em&gt;It’s about a company called Handspring working on, you guessed it, a very early smartphone. It’s a story that I think will resonate with the Decoder audience, so I wanted to sit down with Dieter and talk about it. He even brought an exclusive clip that didn’t make it into the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgNd0U"&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"&gt;documentary is streaming now on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s new streaming apps&lt;/a&gt; that you can get on your TV or set-top box. We have them for Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV. We’ve been working on these for a long time. It’s a little more complicated than you might think to make these apps, make them good, and distribute them on everyone’s app stores. We learned a lot about usage rights and rival closed caption formats — we ran into some real Decoder pain points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZJPPa"&gt;But apps are cool, and you can watch your videos in 4K. You can also listen to this very podcast on our fancy streaming apps on your TV with glorious surround sound. And we’re going to start doing some exclusive videos on the platform, including the one I mentioned up top: a documentary that Dieter and our video team made over many months called &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DdqGhl"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9354497182" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDHy32"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMNSyG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Bohn, you’re the executive editor at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; tell me about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5UidF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a company called Handspring. This was one of the very early companies to try and make one of the very first smartphones. It had a storied legacy, it had genius founders, and it had a nonstop stream of corporate catastrophes that prevented it from being successful. The long and the short is the story of innovation and a scrappy startup trying to do something incredibly ambitious, but there were many reasons why it was not destined to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Alrqqg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We call it a scrappy startup, and it mostly was a scrappy startup, but at one point, it was one of the most successful and fastest-growing tech companies in America and American business history.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbGWff"&gt;That’s right. So the CEO was Donna Dubinsky, and they had launched the Palm Pilot, which you have probably heard of. And through a series of corporate acquisitions, they ended up being stuck at a modem company called 3Com. So they spun out and started Handspring and convinced 3Com to license Palm OS to them. And they launched the Visor, a PDA, and it was wildly successful, relative to other PDAs on the market. So they had a huge, huge initial rush of interest and sales, and things were rocking and rolling pretty fast for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VXXCaL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Handspring Trailer|104173" data-volume-uuid="89d04bab1" data-volume-id="104173" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-485" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xeat29"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They were early to the idea of a smartphone, and the thing they wanted to make was a smartphone. They had some major challenges on the technical side of building a smartphone that early. It seems like their bigger challenges were just finding a market, finding the right people who could sell this thing to other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx9byV"&gt;The really interesting thing about the technical challenge, in particular, is the parts didn’t exist. They wanted to make a smartphone that had a radio that could handle data, and they just couldn’t buy it. It did not exist. The entire infrastructure of factories and supply chains that now exist in Shenzhen and Vietnam and wherever didn’t. So they ended up finding one company, I believe it might have been in France, that happened to make the radios that they needed. And they just had to cobble stuff together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPYumX"&gt;They also had to make bets on what actual radio networks would exist because there were all sorts of weird pager networks and other data networks. So they got through those problems, but then the question becomes, “How do we sell this thing?” And selling phones direct to consumer was not a real viable business. Everything went through the carriers. Before the iPhone, the carriers had absolute control over phones, not just which phones they decided to sell or not sell, but how they worked and what they were allowed to do from a capability perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNjFDj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the thing I end up talking about on Decoder a lot: the best products don’t always win, and there are often gatekeepers, visible or invisible, that are actually shaping the market. Even though they had the best phone in this very early category, they were gatekept out of the market in various ways, but it was still popular. People were still covering it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22278890/jon-fortt-cnbc-anchor-interview-gamestop-stock-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Fort, who has been on Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he’s now an anchor at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he was a cub reporter at the San Jose Mercury News at the time, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is full of clips of his byline as a newspaper reporter. There was a lot of attention being paid to this company. Why were they not able to overcome those gatekeepers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldyhTK"&gt;A lot of it was those gatekeepers were more powerful than they were. Maybe not today, but there was a period after the iPhone where you could get something out to the market without having too much carrier interference. And Handspring did not live in that world whatsoever. They had a hard time getting the phone to sell in some European markets because it didn’t have a 10-key keyboard. The carriers didn’t believe that QWERTY keyboards would be popular and sell. Sprint did not believe that anybody would want to send a picture on their phone. They didn’t want that to happen because other phones couldn’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgnoQ5"&gt;But Handspring also faced a bunch of external problems. They made a huge deal to get a huge office building right after the market crashed. And that market crash caused all sorts of other problems for them, including an excess inventory problem from Palm, which ended up forcing the prices down on all PDAs. So their cash cow that was funding the launch of this phone went away. They were also constantly in the precipice of running out of cash, running out of resources. And they were on that precipice while everybody around them was actively fighting the success of this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fKBssm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone is out now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6PrU8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ideas that happened at Handspring, that company was reacquired by Palm, and then Palm did a bunch of stuff, those ideas are sort of everywhere in computing now. Where are the people? The people had long careers after the Handspring collapse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELKorP"&gt;A few of the key characters, Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, went off to do the thing that Jeff always wanted to do in the first place. For Jeff, smartphones and PDAs was always a side hustle. His real interest is in brain research and trying to figure out how neuroscience and the brain works. And he has some unique theories on that. He finally went off and founded this company called Numenta, and a bunch of the Handspring people came along with him because they all really enjoyed working together. So they’re still over there doing that. Other players went to other places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oTke5"&gt;One thing that’s interesting, this isn’t quite a Handspring thing, but you can follow some of the software history from Palm over to this other company, Palm Source, all the way to some of the founding team for Android. So it wasn’t just the Sidekick team that came over [to Android]; it was also a bunch of expats from Palm Source that originally were trying to bring Palm OS into the future that ended up writing some of the foundations for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhsTvP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just to be clear, the Android project at Google was an acquisition. If you remember the T-Mobile Sidekick, which was a phenomenon for a hot minute, the team that made the Sidekick founded a company called Android. Google bought that company, and they brought over a bunch of ex-Palm people as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0HulD"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jb1oI5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that was the beginning of Android. That theme of “you have ideas, you get them wrong, you keep working at them, ultimately some combination of wireless carriers crushes you out of existence” is a pattern that repeats over and over again. But you can see the lineage is right there, and some of the core ideas of how you would operate a phone that connected to a network and was also a computer started at Palm in a very real way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="tw8kBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGzsbI"&gt;One of the people we interviewed is Rob Haitani, who was the interface designer for Palm OS and later at Handspring. He was trying to convince these software engineers, “This is how you make mobile software.” In the ’90s, no one knew how to make a mobile app. So he would have to be really rigorous about, “No, no, fewer tabs and big buttons. And it needs to be understandable. It has to fit in 160 by 160 pixels.” By the way, this was the screen resolution on these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4J4Et"&gt;He got so tired of explaining how mobile worked to people, so he finally wrote a book that was based on the ideas that got attributed to him. It was called the Zen of Palm, and he had all these cones. So an example was how do you fit a mountain into a teacup? And software engineers would say, “I don’t know, you something, something, something.” “No, you don’t. You just find the diamond. That’s the one that goes in the teacup. That’s the only thing you care about. That’s what goes in your mobile app. Everything else can get buried in a menu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8ClGR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m very confident lots of product managers listen to the show, I hear from you. We live in a world where a lot of this stuff is organized through our systems or competing philosophies of product design and product management. At that point in time, they were just very nascent. It was the beginning of thinking about how to architect computing systems and interfaces, and [Palm and Handspring] invented a lot of this stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHRVmt"&gt;There were competing visions, to be clear. I mean, Pocket PC was a thing, WIN CE, I guess technically we’re talking about, which was a very Windows-esque interface. It had a start button, a literal tiny start button in the lower left-hand corner. And of course, Apple famously made the Newton, and that didn’t go so hot because it was also a little bit overloaded. There was General Magic — everyone has probably heard of that story as well. That was also overloaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTJAj4"&gt;One of the things that Palm figured out was you need to make the simplest possible app that can do the stuff that you want and don’t do more than that. They had an aggressive willingness to say “no,” and they were one of the first tech companies making consumer products who really evangelized the idea that you say “no” before you say “yes.” That hones your product to achieving the things that you want it to do and allows it to do those specific things very well. And then, you can start growing and making it into a more general-purpose platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7vM8D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you mentioned Apple, and that idea about saying no is sort of indelibly associated with Apple and Steve jobs now. There is some connectivity between Apple and the Palm story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9jbD1"&gt;Donna Dubinsky used to work for Steve Jobs. Ed Colligan, who ran marketing and later on became CEO of Palm, also worked for Apple for a time. So they had relationships with Steve Jobs. More than once, there would be a phone call where it’s like, “Is this phone call about Apple maybe buying Palm or Handspring?” Maybe it is, maybe it’s not. And the pivot point of the &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; documentary is this meeting where Jeff, Donna, and Ed went to speak to Steve Jobs about getting the Mac to support their Visor PDA. Steve Jobs didn’t believe in the PDA. He didn’t believe in their vision. And Steve Jobs tried to present his idea of the digital hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ii1brk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is this phone call about Apple maybe buying Palm or Handspring?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0wxKk"&gt;If you remember, he had the Mac at the center of it, and he thought everything was going to circle around the Mac. And Jeff Hawkins said, “No, Steve, I think you’re wrong.” And right next to Steve’s chart on the whiteboard, he drew his own chart with a phone at the center of it. This was well before Apple had been talking about the iPhone at all. And it may be that this was one of the things that convinced Apple, and Steve Jobs in particular, to get serious about coming back to the idea of mobile after walking away from the Newton because that had been such a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZmGnx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famously Ed Colligan, who was running Palm, said, “The PC guys are not just going to walk in and figure this out.” It’s quoted everywhere, and I know that you tried to actually get this audio, unsuccessfully. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQEoaG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the time that Apple was introducing the iPhone and other big companies were introducing their phones. You talked to him about that quote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZI79z"&gt;Yes, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dnnuF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It turns out at least one PC company figured it out. The other ones did not, but you talked to him about that quote. This is a little extra, it’s not in the documentary, but it’s just so fascinating to me. What did he say when you asked him about that quote?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oT6lCx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The PC guys are not just going to walk in and figure this out.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKKhTR"&gt;You’re right, it didn’t make it into the documentary because explaining the context around the quote was too complicated. He said it ahead of the iPhone announcement, but everyone knew the iPhone was coming. It was at a Churchill Club breakfast, and his contention is that he was speaking about the PC industry in general and that making phones was very hard. He knew just as well as anybody because they had been trying to make a smartphone before supply chains for any of these parts even existed. And he also understood, based on his history with Palm, that people had been trying to shrink PC interfaces into tiny mobile interfaces for a while. And that was the wrong idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vNTfi"&gt;So his contention is that he wasn’t speaking specifically about just Apple. He was talking in general about PC people coming in and trying to make phones. So here’s what he said about his famous quote when I interviewed him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="77uNk9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty silly, because if people actually go back and look at that interview, they’ll see that it was probably an hour long. And I thought it was really great, which is one of the sad things about it, that this one thing came out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHHXdx"&gt;But you know, what I meant by that [quote] I think was taken out of context. First of all, I’ve been an Apple proponent for my entire life. My entire career has been built on Apple products. My first company was an accessory company for Apple. My second company was an accessory company for Apple. Radius was an accessory company for Apple. So I’m a huge Apple guy and I always have been, so I wouldn’t disparage them. So when I use [the phrase] PC guys, if I was using that term, it probably was about HP, Compact, Dell, and whoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxowr"&gt;But even if Apple is included in that grouping, what I meant was that these are hard devices to create. And to really nail it, especially the radio side, it’s going to take some real effort. I didn’t say it was impossible. I just said it’s not going to be super simple. And in fact, if people look back at the original iPhone, it was actually a pretty horrible phone, day one. And it did take some iteration for it to get right. Now they had enough other compelling elements around it that people overlooked that, to a large sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2YO51"&gt;So they did really well. And I never, in my wildest dreams, would say Apple can’t create a product in this space. I would’ve never said that and I would’ve never felt that, but I probably just was saying, “Hey, this is a hard business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PHFIM7"&gt;You can judge whether or not he was right about that, but I think that, in general, the PC company that figured it out was Apple, and a bunch of the others kind of didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uR6xLy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bunch of them didn’t. Most of them didn’t. Microsoft didn’t. And that, to me, is the overall lesson here: you can have the idea early, you can even try to copy the idea, but actually executing the idea is extremely difficult. And one of the themes of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that is very resonant to me is that these things are very fragile, especially when they’re early. And the success actually might not be market success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxLfGu"&gt;The subtitle for &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;. We’re aware that Sidekick exists. We’re aware that Symbian was around. But Handspring had the vision for the way that phones should work today, and it was the clearest vision at the time, but that was not enough. You need to understand what the forces are that will prevent your vision from happening. And some of those forces are more than just “can you get the parts?” “Can you build a good product?” Some of it’s stuff like the carriers, stuff like “does the supply chain exist?” And so on. We talk about product fit. That’s a shorthand for a much bigger conversation of what could prevent your good idea from becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5aWQk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This feels like a good place to stop and tell people to go watch this documentary, which is excellent. We premiered it at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s 10th-anniversary event to rapturous applause in the room — which was pretty cool. You can go visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/springboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;theverge.com/springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It has the trailer; it has the information about all the apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLyS2p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will just remind everyone again, we have new &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; streaming TV apps on Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV. Just go into the search box, type in “The Verge,” download the app, watch Springboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQVhSl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter, congratulations. It’s a great documentary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go97WQ"&gt;Hey, thanks. Talk to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Insignia’s 55-inch QLED 4K TV is just $400 for today only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZCQZwt7XzLkois8g_G-M7D6WOA=/34x0:2485x1634/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092585/B823E2AA_EE2D_4D51_9125_88DEF71EF1B4.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwFvZR"&gt;If you’re in need of an affordable 4K TV that punches above its price class before the Black Friday shopping craze begins, Insignia’s F50 QLED 4K TV might be exactly what you’re after. Normally $650, it’s just $400 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVJTb5l0YD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-55-inch-4K-Fire-TV/dp/B08X7JBQ6F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The F50 is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607331/amazon-best-buy-toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-f50" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s latest models&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a big upgrade over its previous Fire TV Edition models. The F50 still features Amazon’s Fire TV software built in, with the ever-helpful Alexa just a button press and ping word away, but it has slimmer bezels, and its panel supports quantum dot HDR technology. With it, the TV should provide better color accuracy, more vivid contrast, and more realistic lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KISfIn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10797476"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrVW96"&gt;Bose’s QC35 Series II over-ear, wireless headphones with noise cancellation have hit their lowest price yet at Amazon. We covered a deal last month that saw them at $250, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756CYWWD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but they cost just $179 right now&lt;/a&gt; in either black or silver colorways. These headphones released a few years ago, but they’re still a solid pick if you want a lightweight pair that sound good and have excellent noise-dampening skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="emwvPZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tn-fX96eR_5b9lex_3JWl0-94hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137433/DSCF5554.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1zNHwQ"&gt;Another great early Black Friday deal is at Walmart on Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus truly wireless earbuds. These usually cost around $100 or so outside of a deal, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but Walmart’s deal takes the cake at just $59&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung released them in a variety of colors, though Walmart’s deal is just on the black-colored model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S92AoE"&gt;While a couple of generations old at this point, they’re still a phenomenal value for this price. Our reviewer Chris Welch lauded their long 11-hour battery life, their comfortable fit, as well as their improved microphone performance that makes taking calls more pleasant. This isn’t as much of a concern given the low price, but note that these don’t feature active noise cancellation, and they don’t support multipoint Bluetooth connections with more than one device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="spEWkB"&gt;If Google’s Nest Wifi mesh solution was previously a little too expensive, whether to jump in for the first time or to add more routers to your pre-existing mesh Wi-Fi system, now’s the time to invest at Amazon. You can get a two-pack of routers (not to be confused with Google’s points that lack Ethernet ports) &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMJ57MB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $209&lt;/a&gt;, down from around $270. So you know, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9548099?hl=en" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;these routers can be mixed-and-matched&lt;/a&gt; with this generation of other Nest Wifi routers, as well as Google’s previous Wifi lineup of hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eCEyBG"&gt;This technically isn’t a brand-new deal, but I wanted to serve up the reminder that you can still save $100 off the usual cost of Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad Pro (128GB, Wi-Fi) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVKgWMaDgM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Originally $799, it’s just $699 for the M1 version. This is likely to be the most affordable price of the year, so keep that in mind as you shop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXISt3"&gt;While you mull it around, consider checking out Brydge’s new 11 Max Plus keyboard for this iPad Pro model that just released on November 3rd. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NYS8O1M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s a $199.99 keyboard&lt;/a&gt; that’ll provide a MacBook-like experience with your tablet with its large, built-in trackpad. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759698/brydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HiDwjr"&gt;All three of the excellent &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; revival games are seeing big discounts right now at Steam, and I heartily recommend playing each of them if you’re a fan of solid third-person action. They’re each similar in design to the likes of &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re faster-paced, with more tomb raiding and a far lower frequency of annoying quips. The &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/203160/Tomb_Raider/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2013 &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; reboot costs just $2.24&lt;/a&gt;, Its sequel, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391220/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is $5.99, and the finale, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391220/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is $13.05.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is giving customers a free year of Paramount Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tA2W1li4Jfih_PIk2FkxabBsbjc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092477/Discovery_Doug_Jones_Sonequa_Martin_Green.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRSpB1"&gt;T-Mobile is once again offering its customers a free streaming deal: starting on November 9th, any T-Mobile or Sprint customer (new or existing) on post-paid cellular or home internet plans can sign up to get a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fparamount-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763109%2Ftmobile-free-year-paramount-plus-essential-plan-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free year’s subscription of Paramount Plus Essential&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMcGIX"&gt;As always, there are caveats for the deal. The promotion only includes access to &lt;a href="https://help.paramountplus.com/s/article/PD-What-plans-are-available-for-Paramount-and-how-much-do-they-cost"&gt;Paramount Plus’ Essential plan&lt;/a&gt;, which typically costs $4.99 per month and has “limited commercial interruptions.” Additionally, unlike the $9.99 per month Premium plan, it doesn’t include a live feed of your local CBS station, although NFL and Champions League games are still available on the lower tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHCAEA"&gt;For new Paramount Plus subscribers, or customers who are already subscribed to the Essential monthly plan, you’ll be able to go to T-Mobile’s promotional site on November 9th, log into your account, and either sign up for a free account or get a coupon code for your existing Paramount Plus subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx7IJ1"&gt;If you’re a Premium customer looking to take advantage of the deal or bought an annual subscription to the service, you’ll have to cancel your existing account, wait until the end of your billing cycle, and then make a new account through the T-Mobile offer. (Additionally, if you’re on the grandfathered in “Limited Commercials plan” from CBS All Access, Paramount  Plus warns that you won’t be able to get it back if you do cancel.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pGW844"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Paramount Plus will not send a reminder alerting you of your upcoming offer expiring.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aDkbCX"&gt;Additionally, in order to sign up for the deal, you’ll have to give Paramount Plus your credit card information — which the company &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use to start charging you for your subscription after the year is up. And in a rather off-putting move, the promotional page clearly warns that “Paramount Plus will not send a reminder alerting you of your upcoming offer expiring,” — so you’ll want to make sure you keep an eye on when your free year is up if you’re looking to avoid getting charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdZJsT"&gt;The new deal is by no means T-Mobile’s first free streaming promotion: the company has given unlimited customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637681/tmobile-unlimited-data-plans-magenta-netflix-basic"&gt;free Netflix for years&lt;/a&gt; and recently offered Magenta and Magenta Plus subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637797/tmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans"&gt;a free year of Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;, too. It even once gave customers with multiple active lines a year of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204260/t-mobile-quibi-subscription-free-access"&gt;free Quibi access&lt;/a&gt; (although, given that Quibi only lasted for seven months, that may not have been the best of deals.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase tests subscription service that waives some trading fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Bitcoin held in a man’s hands..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N50j7O1LpRdn4CA6aXOgQLSlf5g=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092392/1235284597.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sy2B4I"&gt;The largest US cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, is testing a new subscription service that reduces its trading fees in return for a monthly fee, &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/123134/coinbase-is-testing-a-subscription-service-with-zero-trading-fees-and-prioritized-support"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Block &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The subscription service, which is reportedly being called Coinbase One, waives the commission fee Coinbase charges for trades, but customers will still have to pay spread fees to buy or sell cryptocurrency. There’s currently no word on the cost of the subscription, which the company plans to offer to a small number of users to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4Ix7E"&gt;Coinbase confirmed its test of the subscription program in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt;. “Customers in the test group will have the ability to buy, sell, and convert digital currencies on the Coinbase platform without a Coinbase fee for each trade (spread fees still apply),” a spokesperson for the exchange said. “We’re always looking to learn more about how we can best serve our customers in different ways. Right now, we are still in early stages, so everything about the future product experience will be shaped by the feedback we receive from our users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GBFQSC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The future product experience will be shaped by the feedback we receive from our users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqCjJw"&gt;As well as waiving some fees, &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt; reports that Coinbase One could also offer other features like priority phone support, as well as an account protection feature that could reimburse users up to $1 million if their accounts are broken into and their funds are stolen. These two additions are notable in light of user complaints that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348972/coinbase-customer-support-struggles-ipo-cryptocurrency-trading-platform"&gt;surfaced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, where customers reported accounts being locked or hacked, and users struggled to get in contact with customer support at Coinbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1pWom"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/coinbase-tests-commission-free-trading-subscription-service?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase’s interest in subscriptions could be an attempt to compete with rapidly growing competitors like Robinhood, which does not charge trading fees and already offers a subscription service of its own called Robinhood Gold. Coinbase One could also serve as a more predictable source of revenue. Ahead of Coinbase’s latest earnings report on November 9th, analysts are reportedly predicting a decline in Coinbase’s revenue thanks to Bitcoin’s second-quarter slump in value. Subscription revenue could help to smooth out slower quarters like these for Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google outlines plans for first alternative in-app payments in South Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vdqEYoYCJQymuPY-gh5wkaWwAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092299/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KznApg"&gt;Google has announced changes it will make to its in-app payments options in South Korea — a significant step back for the tech giant as governments around the world seek to curb the control Google and Apple wield over their mobile ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgBKo0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it will allow third-party payment options for in-app purchases to appear alongside its own Google Play billing system in Android apps. The company will still charge developers a commission if users pay using a third-party system, but this fee will be reduced slightly as compensation for the costs of supporting alternative payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93UEyw"&gt;Says Google: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WStgSE"&gt;Service fees for distributing apps via Android and Google Play will continue to be based on digital sales on the platform. We recognize, however, that developers will incur costs to support their billing system, so when a user selects alternative billing, we will reduce the developer’s service fee by 4%. For example, for the vast majority of developers who pay 15% for transactions through Google Play’s billing system, their service fee for transactions through the alternate billing system would be 11%. As another example, certain categories of apps participating in our Media Experience Program, such as an eBooks provider, will pay a 10% service fee for transactions made via Google Play’s billing system, but only 6% for transactions on an alternative system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md7378"&gt;Google says this approach will allow it to comply with South Korean law while still investing in the Google Play ecosystem (the company’s long-standing argument for why it charges developers up to 30 percent commission on in-app purchases in the first place). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_UvLzeePFsu2PmO0m742uqL8C-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985218/google_alternative_payments.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration of how Google might allow alternative payment methods to be integrated into Android apps. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IIoxjW"&gt;Google is making these changes in response to specific legislation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed in South Korea last August&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, dubbed the “Google power-abuse-prevention law” by some in the South Korean media, is intended to stop the operators of large app stores (aka Google and Apple) from requiring developers to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; use their own payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDlXvU"&gt;The bill is the first of its kind to mandate such changes in Android and iOS, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;similar legislation&lt;/a&gt; has been considered in the US and Europe. In the US, the issue of Apple and Google collecting commissions on in-app purchases was contentious enough to spark the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;recent lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic and Apple, though Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;largely won&lt;/a&gt; that legal tussle. (Epic also has an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;lawsuit against Google&lt;/a&gt; regarding the same issue.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vphowk"&gt;Apple itself is not making any changes to its mobile payment structure in South Korea in response to this legislation. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-allows-alternate-in-app-payment-options-in-south-korea-though-familiar-fees-remain-11636021788?mod=e2tw"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has told the South Korean government that its current policies are in line with the law. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that the exact wording of the legislation may allow for some wiggle-room for Apple. The law doesn’t directly regulate commissions but says that apps must not be forced to choose a specific payment method because of “unreasonable fees.” Apple, presumably, will argue that its fees are not unreasonable. If the government agency in charge of implementing this law, the Korea Communications Commission, disagrees, then it can open an investigation into Apple’s practices which may lead to fines for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUqX3a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arlo’s new security camera keeps watch over LTE or Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAON7ncOdP2pgaFri6wztc9EhWk=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092271/Go_202_Boat_20Doc.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Arlo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gwbm8P"&gt;If you’re looking to set up a security camera that can keep watch in areas without Wi-Fi, or that’ll still be able to keep an eye on things if your home internet goes out, Arlo’s new LTE-powered camera may be of interest. The $250 Arlo Go 2 LTE / Wi-Fi camera is built to go in somewhat remote places, like on a barn, cabin, or boat dock, and features full HD video recording (though saving that to the cloud will require a subscription, more on that later), weather resistance, and a rechargeable and swappable battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g751V"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/15/13636208/netgear-arlo-go-security-camera-lte"&gt;original Arlo Go&lt;/a&gt; was significantly more expensive at around $400, &lt;a href="https://kb.arlo.com/1201822/How-do-I-set-up-my-Arlo-Go-camera"&gt;didn’t support Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; (and therefore couldn’t use its cellular connection as a backup to your home internet like the 2 can), and also only recorded in 720p. For the second generation, it’s been bumped up to a more modern 1080p, letting you get a clearer view of what’s going on. Arlo says the camera’s batteries will last up to three months if you’re using cellular, and up to eight if you’re using Wi-Fi, though that’ll obviously depend on how often the camera is activated. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XbMCqYp3U0D_CEA7TknPui8pPjk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22984316/Go_202_Hero.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arlo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Go 2 is weather resistant, and features a spotlight and rechargeable battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fMTVXX"&gt;Arlo has also added GPS to the Go 2 (to help you find it in a large area, or if it’s stolen), added a spotlight to let you see nighttime events in color instead of black and white, and upgraded the audio — you can now have a real-time conversation with someone in front of the camera, rather than the radio-like push-to-talk system from the first generation. Basically, it’s similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504755/arlo-pro-4-wire-free-spotlight-camera-ultra-2"&gt;Arlo’s Pro 4 camera&lt;/a&gt;, but with a focus on being able to put it anywhere there’s cell service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzKhva"&gt;Unfortunately, you’ll have to pay for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlo.com%2Fen-us%2Farlosecure.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22760520%2Farlo-security-camera-lte-wi-fi-go-2-subscription-gps" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo’s Secure Subscription&lt;/a&gt; if you want to have easy access to recorded footage or use the camera’s person, animal, and vehicle detection — though the camera does come with a free three month trial. The basic version of the service costs $3 a month for one camera, or $10 a month for unlimited cameras (there’s also a premium $15 option that includes emergency response). While the Go 2 will be able to record to a microSD card if you don’t want to pay for a subscription, you probably won’t want to go pull it out of the camera every time you want to review footage  — part of the Go 2’s appeal is that it can be placed in somewhat remote places. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UfgtZ9WO7Bxf2UPvHod7dBAGHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22984476/Screen_Shot_2021_11_03_at_17.14.24.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features available with and without Arlo’s subscription.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NHXx70"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can put the Arlo Go 2 anywhere, but making full use of it will require a subscription or two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kP5ZqV"&gt;While subscriptions are becoming standard across cameras, you’ll definitely want to take note of the monthly cost for the Go 2 — you’ll also need to pay for a cellular plan to take advantage of its LTE capabilities. From Verizon, the only carrier the camera is launching with, that’ll cost anywhere from $5 a month (for adding the camera to a shared data plan) to $20 a month for unlimited data. Arlo does say it’ll make the Go 2 available through more carriers next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2xj3Y"&gt;Despite those caveats, the Go 2 doesn’t have a ton of competition from traditional smart home camera companies. And, given its lower price, and the utility of being able to just put a camera wherever, you are getting a lot for your willingness to put up with a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

A recent report from security outfit Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/11/04/scammers-used-google-ads-to-steal-500k-worth-of-cryptocurrency/"&gt;highlights a potent form of attack&lt;/a&gt;: using Google Ads to direct users to fake crypto wallets. In its report, CPR said it has seen roughly half a million dollars siphoned off through these methods in just the last few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipvf1R"&gt;Here’s how the scam works. Attacker buys Google Ads in response to searches for popular crypto wallets (that’s the software used to store cryptocurrency, NFTs, and the like). CPR says it’s noticed scams targeting Phantom and MetaMask wallets, which are the most popular wallets for the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qhv66V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The scam is a fairly typical phishing attack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ivRXI"&gt;When an unsuspecting user Googles “phantom,” the Google Ad result (which appears above actual search results) directs them to a phishing website that looks like the real thing. Then, one of two things happens: either the user enters their credentials which the attacker keeps. Or, much weirder, if they try to create a new wallet they’re told to use a recovery password which actually logs them into a wallet controlled by the attacker, not their own. “This means if they transfer any funds, the attacker will get that immediately,” says CPR. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEEUdvem-SP30q2x5AZp69_88D8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985198/Screen_Shot_2021_11_04_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The attackers use fake URLs to trick users into thinking they’re logging into their crypto wallets&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHsgUL2wGU48BRZr-0Yc4wtwKzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985199/Screen_Shot_2021_11_04_at_10.37.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CPR&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As with other phishing scams, the fake sites are designed to look as similar as possible to the real ones. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1SUWOL"&gt;As with phishing scams more generally, the attackers rely on making their fake log-in pages look as much as possible like the real thing. CPR notes that they’ve seen attackers use fake URLs to trick users, directing them to phanton.app or phantonn.app, for example, instead of the correct phantom.app. The group has also seen similar phishing scams used to direct users to fake crypto currency exchanges, including PancakeSwap and UniSwap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dyo6L0"&gt;CPR’s researchers say they started noticing these scams after seeing crypto users complain about their losses on Reddit and other forums. They estimate that “at least half a million dollars” have been stolen over the past few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuQfIq"&gt;“I believe we’re at the advent of a new cyber crime trend, where scammers will use Google Search as a primary attack vector to reach crypto wallets, instead of traditionally phishing through email,” said CPR’s Oded Vanunu in a press statement. “The phishing websites where victims were directed to reflected meticulous copying and imitation of wallet brand messaging. And what’s most alarming is that multiple scammer groups are bidding for keywords on Google Ads, which is likely a signal of the success of these new phishing campaigns that are geared to heist crypto wallets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwEfA1"&gt;The group offers a few words of wisdom for users hoping to avoid these pitfalls, including never clicking on Google Ads results but instead looking at search results, and always checking the URL of the site you’re visiting. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo cuts Switch sales forecast due to global chip shortage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSi7lN"&gt;Nintendo had a relatively quiet quarter for Switch sales, with 3.83 million units shipped between July and September. That’s a big drop on the same period &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550621/nintendo-earnings-q2-2020-switch-sales"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the company moved 6.86 million units. Nintendo has now sold 92.87 million Switch consoles to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyKExH"&gt;Nintendo says “the extended impact of both COVID-19 and the global semiconductor shortage creates a state of continued uncertainty” and is revising its Switch sales forecast for the financial year down by 1.5 million units. The company had previously expected to sell 25.5 million consoles between April 2021 and March 2022, but has now set the figure at 24 million. However, Nintendo isn’t altering its expectations for revenue, and actually expects operating profit to be 4 percent higher than previously predicted. The modified forecast takes into account revisions in exchange rates as well as higher projected software sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mCgv55"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="blZeFq"&gt;To put the Switch’s performance in context, it could well overtake the Wii in lifetime sales this current holiday quarter. The Wii is Nintendo’s most popular home console of all time and sold 101.63 million units in total; Nintendo sold 11.57 million Switch units between October and December last year. If you consider the Switch a handheld, though, it’s still trailing the Game Boy’s 118.69 million units and the 154.02 million racked up by the DS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji205l"&gt;Nintendo doesn’t have a huge lineup of games for the holiday season, although the already-released &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt; will factor into this quarter’s figures. The biggest imminent releases are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535212/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-ii-links-awakening-game-watch-handheld-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-themed Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; remake has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740195/nintendo-advance-wars-1-2-re-boot-camp-switch-switch-remaster-delay"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; into spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
