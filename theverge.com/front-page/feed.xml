    <title>SoftBank has reportedly halted production of its Pepper robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pepper-softbank-robot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aa6HeT0Ma1wIiEoyx7r7HJet_JQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515973/DSC01589__1_.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hv8v9k"&gt;SoftBank is reportedly restructuring its robotics business and has already halted production of its Pepper robot, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Robotics is just one of many businesses the large Japanese firm has invested in, but potentially permanently ending production of Pepper is notable because of the robot’s role as a sort of unofficial mascot for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8npFxE"&gt;SoftBank plans to lay off 330 staff members based in France, the original home of SoftBank’s robotics efforts, and apparently half of the division’s sales team in the UK and the US, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; writes. Production of Pepper robots was reportedly halted last year and would be costly to restart, &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; sources claim. We’ve reached out to SoftBank to confirm the details of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOJY3h"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;report follows closely after SoftBank’s sale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics to Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly seems like the company is reconsidering what exactly it wants to do in the robot business. For now, that means less futuristic moonshot promises and more practical business-type offerings, like &lt;a href="https://us.softbankrobotics.com/whiz"&gt;a carpet-cleaning robot called Whiz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRz8d4"&gt;Pepper was initially pitched as a robot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/5/5781628/softbank-announces-pepper-robot"&gt;that could understand human emotion&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/19/5820080/meeting-softbank-pepper-robot"&gt;possible&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced and hasn’t become any more true, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10726082/softbank-pepper-ibm-watson-collaboration"&gt;an assist from IBM’s Watson&lt;/a&gt;. SoftBank then pushed its friendly bot into all sorts of odd, if charming scenarios, like working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/24/16196752/robot-buddhist-priest-funeral-softbank"&gt;as a Buddhist priest&lt;/a&gt;, playing docent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/4/24/17277350/softbank-pepper-the-robot-smithsonian-museum"&gt;at the Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;, and staffing the company’s stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hJBwGf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-A3ZLLGuvQY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=82&amp;amp;start=82" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vxYQXo"&gt;Pepper might not have ever lived up to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A3ZLLGuvQY&amp;amp;t=82s"&gt;the ads used to sell it&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, but it could be charming. My interactions with the waist-high android are limited, but after hearing about Pepper a lot online, seeing the real deal was kind of a capital-E experience. I had wandered into a crowded SoftBank store in Tokyo and was greeted by Pepper in Japanese with a friendly smile and a little wave. On paper, traditional robot stuff. But in the moment? I would have at least considered whatever prepaid phone plan Pepper was pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube wins naming rights for 6,000-seat event venue at Hollywood Park</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZD_Ug9S_6q5slF7NqLPqmzwHsOk=/225x0:1635x940/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515360/youtube_theater_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube Theater | YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VUAXLp"&gt;Google-owned YouTube will have its name on a new live event venue in Inglewood, California, part of the new Hollywood Park mixed-use development, the &lt;a href="https://www.sofistadium.com/youtube-partners-with-partners-hollywood-park-to-name-performance-venue-youtube-theater/"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube Theater will be a 6,000-seat performance venue, which will host concerts, comedy shows, YouTube creator events, esports competitions, and community shows. Financial terms of the multiyear naming rights deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VqNbr"&gt;The development is the site of the former Hollywood Park Racetrack and part of the same complex as SoFi Stadium — where the Rams and Chargers play — and American Airlines Plaza. Hollywood Park also houses 3,000 apartments, a 300-room hotel, and an 890,000 square-foot retail area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oe7srF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GH9RsPGyVzs?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=6&amp;amp;start=6" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SVZEy"&gt;“YouTube Theater will drive the uniqueness of YouTube by combining physical, ‘in real life’ events that bring creators and fans together, while simultaneously sharing ​that same event​ experience with our two billion global monthly users through livestreams and VOD content,” YouTube vice president of brand marketing Angela Courtin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sySMu2"&gt;Upcoming performers at the three-story, 227,000-square foot YouTube Theater include Pitbull and Iggy Azalea, Black Pumas, and TLC with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. The venue also has a 6,100-square-foot stage and a 3,500-square-foot private club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL9kjG"&gt;The theater will have a large-scale digital YouTube “play” button icon outside the venue, which can turn into an immersive video screen where guests can mirror themselves or view highlights from YouTube creators and artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUo4Gk"&gt;YouTube Theater is set to open for its first events later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMC2y4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AdBlock glitch blanks out content on Twitter, Wikipedia, Amazon, and other sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adblock Plus logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FB-Fp7hQEZwltnMdw7kkDO_F4yU=/133x0:1572x959/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515342/abp.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3AgNp"&gt;If the internet has looked a little empty to you over the last day or so, check to see if your browser is using AdBlock or Adblock Plus. &lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=82553"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1409495451418640388"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/broderick/status/1409507225094209540"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt;, ad blockers have inadvertently wiped out the content they’re looking for on a number of mainstream sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKZVkh"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what caused the problem, but the issue should either resolve itself or it can be fixed by going into settings and requesting an update for your filter lists. In an email, the Adblock Plus support channel confirmed the problem “has already been fixed” without going in depth about what it was. Several &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Adblock/comments/o9hfbg/issue_on_many_website_since_a_few_days/h3c49d4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posts on social media&lt;/a&gt; pointed to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist/commit/9a35decd7429737af9c814bf16cf30caed8f939"&gt;recent change in filtering&lt;/a&gt; that works in other blockers but was interpreted by Adblock Plus to block content tagged as “media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc09Cg"&gt;There’s no public statement available from the Adblock Plus social channels or owners eyeo GmbH, but at least the problem was only temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music Unlimited offers six months of Disney Plus for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1rt2Ej7ZfbLHGeIa4ly9ExSfaU=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515302/download.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1Y4Uh"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited customers can now score several months of Disney Plus for free, and the offer extends to new subscribers as well as existing users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0YPF"&gt;Amazon announced Monday that existing Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers in the US and Canada can activate three months of Disney’s streaming service for free through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/amazon-music-disney-plus-promotion"&gt;a new promotion&lt;/a&gt;. New Amazon Music Subscribers, meanwhile, will be able to access six months of Disney Plus through the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0t2Ym"&gt;Amazon’s ad-free music streaming service costs $8 a month or $80 annually after a trial period. It is separate from Prime Music, the music service bundled with an Amazon Prime subscription. But where Prime Music has a catalog of roughly 2 million songs, Amazon Music Unlimited’s library comprises roughly 75 million songs and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAk6dq"&gt;The promotion is not, however, valid for users who already subscribe to Disney Plus. But if you’ve yet to subscribe to Disney’s streaming service, now’s not a bad time. New titles are releasing on the service every week, and the company has said that users can expect 100 new titles from Marvel, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and National Geographic to hit the service each year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has become a $1 trillion company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrqSG-nohPSsyEr7S-IBnpGeX6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69515217/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLlhqZ"&gt;Facebook has joined the ranks of companies valued over a trillion dollars as of today’s market close. The company’s market cap is sitting at $1.008 trillion &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB"&gt;according to Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, putting it over the mark for the first time in its history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqESF5"&gt;Some of the most notable of Facebook’s divisions are the Facebook site itself, along with Messenger, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus. On &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;the list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft"&gt;of US tech companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;that have passed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;the $1 trillion valuation&lt;/a&gt; mark, Facebook is the only one founded in the 2000s, making it the newest — as long as you’re counting from the date that Google was started (which was in 1998), instead of Alphabet (which was created 2015). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VCfxd"&gt;The news comes alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;the dismissal of the FTC’s case&lt;/a&gt; to unwind Facebook’s Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, after a federal judge stated that the FTC did not offer enough evidence that the company is a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say farewell to the BMW i3, the kooky electric hatchback that couldn’t quite make it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BMW i3 hero" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssvkhGIZAwjCnKaqZxZk-gz5y3M=/2x0:1099x731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514972/BMW16_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7rrZO"&gt;BMW will stop selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/17/5317032/bmw-i3-driving-the-electric-rebel-in-munichs-stable"&gt;the i3 electric hatchback&lt;/a&gt; in the US starting next month. It’s the latest pint-sized vehicle to fall victim to American car buyers’ insatiable appetite for huge, towering, climate-killing trucks and SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuI2kv"&gt;First released in 2013, the i3 was BMW’s first real electric vehicle. Always intended to be more of a city car than anything intended for long trips, the i3 maxed out at 80 miles of range from a 22kWh battery, with a modest 170 horsepower. The battery capacity grew 50 percent — to 33kWh — after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/1/11550026/bmw-i3-2017-electric-vehicle-range-larger-battery"&gt;2017 update&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the range to 113 miles. Thanks to its kooky, futuristic, and polarizing design, it was never a sales juggernaut, but it certainly developed a cult following over time. The i3 was able to carve out a niche in the nascent EV market and, all told, BMW has sold about 100,000 of them globally since it launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pP25D6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the i3 was BMW’s first real electric vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zkca7l"&gt;But its relevance was certainly on the wane. &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/06/25/bmw-i3-era-comes-to-an-end-in-the-u-s-this-july/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BMW Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the i3’s inventory for the US was at its lowest point over the last 12 months, with customers often experiencing difficulties securing a production slot. Last year, only 1,052 i3s were sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cR2Av"&gt;In an email, a spokesperson for BMW confirmed that US production of the i3 will end July 2021. “At the time of its launch in 2013, the BMW i3 represented a pioneering moment in electric vehicles and lightweight construction,” the spokesperson said. “Not only was the BMW i3 of the world’s first purpose-built electric vehicles, but the use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic and aluminum in the vehicle’s construction, made it truly unique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P07Yha"&gt;The “success” of the i3 has helped lay the groundwork for the imminent release of the BMW iX SUV and i4 sedan, which together represent the tip of the spear in the automaker’s belated effort to recapture its early sales momentum for EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuYR4E"&gt;BMW fans were disappointed that the automaker never made successors for the i3 or the plug-in hybrid i8 sports car in the years since those cars were released. But the company is iterating on the underlying electric technology. Now, that next-gen tech will not only power &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462746/bmw-ix-suv-ev-price-specs"&gt;the iX SUV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462504/bmw-i4-ev-price-specs-photos-release-date"&gt;the i4 sedan&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17279482/bmw-ix3-concept-specs-beijing-motor-show"&gt;the China-made iX3&lt;/a&gt; (which is now officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171762/bmw-ix3-long-range-electric-suv-us-market-china-europe"&gt;not destined for the US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZS3Tf"&gt;Of course, the iX and i4 will be more expensive than the i3, which started at around $44,000. The base model i4 will start at $55,400, while the iX is expected to sell for $83,200. Both EVs will go on sale in the US starting in early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Oth0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal court dismisses FTC’s bid to unwind Instagram from Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31Q8Uyv6kjS3tSwv5ISFIbxIZdo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514871/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KrJR4W"&gt;On Monday, a US District Court dealt a huge blow to the federal government’s antitrust case against Facebook by &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf"&gt;dismissing a complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company by the Federal Trade Commission. The lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed late last year&lt;/a&gt;, sought to unwind Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The judge also dismissed an associated case filed by a group of state attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4e8WJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0134/facebook-inc-ftc-v"&gt;its initial complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC alleged that Facebook violated federal antitrust laws by purchasing a would-be competitor in the social media market. But in his decision to dismiss the complaint Monday, Judge James E. Boasberg wrote that the FTC offered insufficient evidence for its central claim — that Facebook wields monopoly power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ozLskU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case involves no ordinary or intuitive market”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6nPtzD"&gt;“The FTC has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element of all of its Section 2 claims —namely, that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for Personal Social Networking (PSN) Services,” Boasberg wrote. “The complaint contains nothing on that score save the naked allegation that the company has had and still has a ‘dominant share of th[at] market (in excess of 60%).’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8GvgF"&gt;Boasberg also dismissed the claims against Facebook’s interoperability restrictions, finding that the policies were implemented too long ago to be subject to FTC action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caHK8N"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, the company’s stock surged in response to the dismissal, clearing $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time in Facebook history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zSp7R"&gt;The ruling also struck down a parallel anti-monopoly case against Facebook filed by a coalition of state attorneys general. Nearly every state attorney general signed onto a lawsuit against Facebook in December, making similar allegations as the FTC case. But Boasberg dismissed that case &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974156-govuscourtsdcd2249231370_1"&gt;in an accompanying decision&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, holding that &lt;a href="https://pivotallawgroup.com/Blog/2019/08/Case-Law-Update-The-Doctrine-of"&gt;a specific civil law doctrine&lt;/a&gt; prevented the coalition from challenging acquisitions settled so many years in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXI0vd"&gt;Notably, Judge Boasberg left room for the FTC to revise its case and unwind past Facebook mergers. The commission has until July 29th to file a new complaint outlining its argument regarding Facebook’s market dominance, and the judge made it clear that the FTC’s case was not affected by the civil doctrine that doomed the state attorneys general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsoGJD"&gt;“An injunction under Section 13(b) is a theoretically available remedy in a Section 2 challenge to long-ago mergers,” Boasberg wrote in the FTC opinion, “so long as the defendant still holds the purchased assets or stock, as is the case here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXeGo1"&gt;Boasberg also noted the inherent difficulty of establishing monopoly power for a free online service, as the FTC is now required to do. “This case involves no ordinary or intuitive market,” Boasberg’s opinion reads. “Rather, PSN [Personal Social Networking] services are free to use, and the exact metes and bounds of what even constitutes a PSN service — &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, which features of a company’s mobile app or website are included in that definition and which are excluded — are hardly crystal clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqqYvo"&gt;The court’s dismissal could provoke more aggressive action from the legislature, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;Congress is currently pushing forward&lt;/a&gt; on sweeping tech antitrust reforms. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee approved a slate of bills targeting Big Tech’s market power, including bans on large mergers and new interoperability requirements. All six measures are headed to the House floor and parallel bills are expected to be introduced in the Senate over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmgwV6"&gt;“Today’s development in the FTC’s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1409594342860283904?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers to go after Big Tech companies engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7rfJa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXXbgz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley stepping down from full-time role</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dennis Crowley, co-founder of Foursquare" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fotqHMsSaZgaBIniWUmsp2UNkLQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514859/1173502621.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dennis Crowley, co-founder of Foursquare, is stepping down from his full-time role with the company | Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82cd"&gt;Foursquare founder and former CEO Dennis Crowley is stepping down from his full-time role at the company, he wrote &lt;a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d"&gt;in a Medium post on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. He’ll remain on the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPiQ9j"&gt;“What started around my kitchen table in the East Village back in early 2009 has grown to nearly 400 people working around the world in 2021,” Crowley wrote. “What started as a quest to ‘build a Marauders Map’ and to ‘turn the real world into a game’ and ‘build a hipster version of Clippy’ has turned into one of the world’s leading location technology platforms, powering location services for thousands of apps and top brands around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPCkaS"&gt;Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai launched Foursquare in 2009 as a smartphone app that let people use their then-fledgling iPhones with built-in GPS to check in at their physical locations. It gamified the collection of location data, letting people earn badges for a certain number of check-ins (how many places were you “mayor” of?). Venues offered rewards to entice customers to check in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r6wHFI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After 12+ yrs, I’m stepping back from Foursquare (tho I’ll remain on the Board). FSQ has been the best job I’ve ever had, with the best people I’ve ever worked with. Huge thx to our team, investors, partners, superusers &amp;amp; fans. Much love &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoFoursquareGo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoFoursquareGo&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://t.co/oTAtR1J6Y7"&gt;https://t.co/oTAtR1J6Y7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dennis Crowley    (@dens) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dens/status/1409506346391719941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xG0kIJ"&gt;But Foursquare did away with the check-ins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5666062/foursquare-swarm-new-app"&gt;in 2014, and introduced its Swarm app&lt;/a&gt;, which was much less popular (no more mayors!) and became a way for users to check in with friends and create “lifelogs.” Foursquare’s main business pivoted away from consumer tech toward a B-to-B model — consider that it was sitting on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/7/3068529/all-new-foursquare-andrew-hogue-big-data"&gt;massive trove of user data&lt;/a&gt; — and provided its location technology via its &lt;a href="https://medium.com/foursquare-direct/on-announcing-foursquares-pilgrim-sdk-cb3f6ab9cfa8"&gt;Pilgrim SDK&lt;/a&gt; to other companies. It claimed Uber, Twitter, Snapchat, WeChat, and Apple Maps among its clientele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceurqk"&gt;Crowley says in the Medium post (and has said in numerous interviews) that the point of Foursquare “was never to build an awesome check-in button,” but rather to invent “the future of location tech.” Foursquare “did over $100M+ in revenue in 2020, and we’ll do *well over* $100M+ in revenue in 2021,” according to the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ioW6w"&gt;He says he’s departing the company he cofounded to spend time with his family and because he has “lots of things I still want to build — many of which don’t fit neatly into the Foursquare of 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7SSVm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming is now widely available on iOS and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWKm1w2P73spuHwhf-nPFFBL7Fc=/0x0:1786x1191/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514765/xcloudiphoneipad.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QwiF2U"&gt;Microsoft’s xCloud, the cloud game streaming component of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that doesn’t require a console to use, is rolling out fully to iOS devices, including iPhones and iPads, as well as PCs and macOS computers via the web. It’s been in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;invite-only beta period since mid-April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but Game Pass Ultimate subscribers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http://xbox.com/play&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22155602__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can now access games right from their devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgVvlR"&gt;Microsoft says that on PCs, xCloud can be accessed through the Edge browser and Google Chrome. We’ve gotten it to work within macOS on Microsoft Edge and Safari. More than 100 games are available, and the service is compatible with Bluetooth controllers or ones connected via USB. On iOS, it’ll work as a web-based app via Safari, and you’ll have a choice between a controller or touch controls for certain games. &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/28/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-running-on-xbox-series-x/"&gt;Microsoft also shared in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; that xCloud is now powered by Xbox Series X consoles, setting the streaming at 1080p at up to 60 frames per second with a fast enough internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ciTfZ6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, Xbox Cloud Gaming is running on custom Xbox Series X hardware, and available to all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@XboxGamePass&lt;/a&gt; Ultimate members with Windows 10 PCs and Apple phones and tablets, via browser, across 22 countries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HYuvbHGBUg"&gt;https://t.co/HYuvbHGBUg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxGamePass?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxGamePass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1409587759614885889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KVwCVj"&gt;The road to getting xCloud on iOS was a bumpy one, with Apple’s App Store guidelines initially blocking not just Microsoft but also Google’s Stadia and Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud streaming services from launching on the App Store. Apple eventually carved out some loopholes to allow them to operate via the web (but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;not without caveats&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7crOwz"&gt;To celebrate the launch, Microsoft put its “Designed for Xbox” badge on one of the best mobile gaming accessories around: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone’s One controller&lt;/a&gt;. This new version is physically identical to the preexisting model that has been available since late 2020 because it’s technically the same. What’s changed is the physical packaging that now calls out its Xbox compatibility, and despite no increase in price ($99.99), it comes with a complimentary three-month trial to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for new members, which usually costs $45 on its own. It’s available through &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fbackbone-one-mobile-ios-gaming-controller-for-xbox%2F8x4fhh4x4mhx%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F28%2F22554267%2Fmicrosoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Razer’s revised version of the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-controllers%2Frazer-kishi%2FRZ06-03360200-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Kishi controller for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; has monochrome buttons and also includes a Game Pass Ultimate trial for new users. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;read my colleague Sam Byford’s review of that one here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backbone One’s refined interface for xCloud support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JUBTBU"&gt;Backbone has recently updated its app with some deep Xbox integration, like tagging gameplay that you’ve recorded through xCloud. You can edit footage within the app and upload it as a link. It also features a new dynamic Xbox Game Pass feed to tell you about new games to try out and other suggestions based on your friends’ activities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hold off on updating Snapchat for iOS — the latest version is crashing on launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wu7ItIATayqYYKLGHTtE5ta4qUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69514767/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yBtjoK"&gt;If you haven’t updated to the latest version of Snapchat on iOS, dubbed version 11.34.0.35 and released late Sunday&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; don’t — the app is crashing on launch (&lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/28/dont-update-the-ios-snapchat-app-until-its-fixed"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1409501297737359366?s=20"&gt;company has tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it’s aware of the issue and is working on a fix, but for now if you want to stay snapping you should probably stick with the old version. The bug doesn’t appear to be affecting the Android version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2Z7F"&gt;On my iPhone 12 Mini, the app stays open just long enough to give me a message that something went wrong, before crashing to Springboard. It is worth noting, though, that it was giving me that message before I updated as well, indicating that something may be amiss with Snapchat overall. The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1we3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh snap &lt;a href="https://t.co/yC2BKjhzmw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yC2BKjhzmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1409582267270270976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPdSne"&gt;If you’ve got automatic updates on for the App Store, but the buggy version of Snapchat hasn’t made it to your phone yet, you can turn auto-updating off by going to your iPhone’s Settings &amp;gt; App Store, and toggling App Updates off under Automatic Downloads. Just be sure to remember to turn it back on when this clears up — we’ll be sure to let you know when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
