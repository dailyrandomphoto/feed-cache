    <title>Microsoft PowerToys get Windows 11 UI updates, universal mic mute, and find my mouse feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWTGVBQcFWAeUhc-gegv94_mgQ4=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70061421/powertoys_2019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9MdAr"&gt;Microsoft is updating its PowerToys for Windows with new UI changes for Windows 11, a universal video conference mute, and a find my mouse feature. The software maker has been gradually improving PowerToys ahead of the Windows 11 launch, with a settings interface to match the OS and now changes to its PowerRename feature that better match the Windows 11 design improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGnoOe"&gt;PowerRename, a feature to make it easier to rename files, no longer looks like it has a dialog box from the Windows 7 era. Microsoft has updated PowerRename with a far more modern interface, and easier to find options for renaming files in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UluK6g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Old vs. new UI for PowerToys Rename! Go get it now in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PowerToys?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PowerToys&lt;/a&gt; 0.49.. &lt;a href="https://t.co/x7xLB6YZyg"&gt;https://t.co/x7xLB6YZyg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YjIL2vavfZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YjIL2vavfZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Niels Laute (@Niels9001) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Niels9001/status/1453807954206105614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xBVVGw"&gt;Alongside the design tweaks, PowerToys is also getting two new features with this &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/latest"&gt;0.49 version update&lt;/a&gt;. Video Conference Mute debuts with this release, a feature that lets you mute your microphone or disable your webcam globally across Windows 10 or Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UcoDG"&gt;You can bind Video Conference Mute to a keyboard shortcut, and pick the webcam and microphone you’d like to disable. There’s even a toolbar that appears when a webcam or microphone is in use. Microsoft had been planning to launch Windows 11 with its own universal microphone mute button, but this feature didn’t make the release and should be coming at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vxQBovhw6VnlM3sG_y8OXD_rI0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966179/g8Da16A.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PowerToys Video Conference Mute feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzNIrXNoWQRC79JFJi6Ie_5ogNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966184/j0wadII.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My Mouse will dim your screen to reveal the cursor location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1suM"&gt;The second new feature is Find My Mouse, which as the name implies will help you find your mouse cursor. Windows has had built-in support for finding a cursor for years, but this is a far better implementation. You simply tap CTRL twice and your screen will dim to highlight where your cursor is with a spotlight. While you probably won’t need this on a laptop, it will be useful if you’re working with large high-resolution displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFqMkp"&gt;Both of the new PowerToys features are available in the latest 0.49 update from &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/latest"&gt;Microsoft’s PowerToys GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. PowerToys also includes a number of other utilities, including a feature to keep your PC awake, FancyZones to improve layouts and multitasking, and a PowerToys Run launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp8PN9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG TVs can now automatically disable motion smoothing for Prime Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FcptTmrXhF4QthDtVGIztgReXq0=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70061413/LG_Amazon_FFM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG + Prime Video + Filmmaker Mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g7S8NL"&gt;LG’s 2020 and 2021 4K and 8K TVs can now turn on Filmmaker Mode automatically when you’re watching content from Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/10/lg-smart-tvs-now-feature-auto-switching-to-filmmaker-mode-on-prime-video-content/"&gt;LG has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Filmmaker mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836496/uhd-alliance-filmmaker-mode-lg-panasonic-vizio-motion-smoothing-interpolation-post-processing"&gt;was launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as a convenient way to turn off picture processing features like motion smoothing and image sharpening, which can create a horrid unnatural look often referred to as the “soap opera effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1si7M"&gt;LG calls Prime Video’s ability to automatically trigger Filmmaker Mode an “industry first.” It delivers on a promise the company made when it first introduced the setting to its TVs &lt;a href="https://www.avforums.com/news/lg-filmmaker-mode-will-use-autosensing.17119"&gt;back at CES 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when it said it would be offering an API to streaming apps to enable the mode automatically. Although it’s previously been possible to manually turn on the mode via a TV’s settings menu, automatic switching is convenient if you often switch between content where some image processing can be helpful (like live sports) and more traditional film or TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cjXRJ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Easier than manually turning on the feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKm09f"&gt;Although the switching process is largely automatic, LG’s press release says a pop-up will give viewers the option of confirming or declining Filmmaker Mode when compatible content is detected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSbYDT"&gt;Of course, a lot of this hassle could be avoided if TV manufacturers didn’t insist on having features like motion smoothing turned on by default in the first place. But LG’s press release insists that these post processing features are “ideal for most forms of content” like sports and TV shows. If you don’t agree, then check out our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127329/how-to-turn-off-motion-smoothing-tv-lg-samsung-vizio-sony-roku"&gt;how to disable motion smoothing&lt;/a&gt; on your TV, so you never have to worry about it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Md9Lq"&gt;LG says the software update that’ll enable Prime Video’s automatic Filmmaker mode switching is rolling out to compatible webOS 5 and webOS 6 TVs “starting this week.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s PowerShot PX is a home surveillance camera for happy memories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwjwpHAa8yJyKCu_aGSbNrVVMyk=/0x35:850x602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70061394/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_10.40.01_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbvTKM"&gt;Parents take a lot of photos of their kids, but who wants to be constantly lingering on the fringes of family gatherings with their phone out? That’s the problem &lt;a href="https://www.canon-europe.com/cameras/powershot-px/"&gt;Canon’s new PowerShot PX&lt;/a&gt; is trying to solve. It’s essentially a home surveillance camera for happy memories. Stick it somewhere near you and it will automatically snap photos and videos, using built-in “subject recognition” to frame and select shots that you can browse later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPIok"&gt;It’s not exactly a new concept. Google promised similar functionality with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17055618/google-clips-smart-camera-review"&gt;its Clips camera in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (though the company leaned more heavily than Canon on the promise of machine learning to select the right moment). But reactions were mixed, to say the least. Some thought Clips was creepy or invasive, while others said it was really &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/5/16428708/google-clips-camera-privacy-parents-children"&gt;no different, ethically speaking, than snapping pictures on your Android phone&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, though, the videos and images Clips captured just weren’t good enough, in terms of either picture quality or AI-driven timing. Clips was expensive, too, at $249. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfhYNq"&gt;The PowerShot PX definitely doesn’t solve this last problem, with a retail price of £449.99 in the UK and €499.99 in Europe. A straight euros to dollars conversion would give a retail price in the US of $582, but availability and price in the States has yet to be confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eED6w-CQ1SZJES17afnX-FgwIwI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966175/Screen_Shot_2021_10_29_at_10.40.01_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Canon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PowerShot PX is always watching. But, you know, in a good way. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcmXnHAoEydZKvK2Lt89PFnYFT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966178/canon_powershot_px.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Canon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t help that it looks just like a security cam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lAYB7i"&gt;Spec-wise, the PowerShot PX has a 11.7 megapixel 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor, and can record 11 megapixel JPEG stills or full HD (1920 x 1080) MP4 video to a bundled 16GB microSD card. The big feature is a mechanical pan and tilt mechanism, which lets the camera move 340 degrees left to right and 110 degrees up and down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2sCqQ"&gt;This last function is what enables the smart framing feature to work, and could well distinguish the PowerShot PX from the static camera on the Clips. Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allows for wireless transfer of photos and videos to computers or to a connected app that makes it easier to sort and select content. Oh, and there’s also a voice control function if you want to request that the PX capture a specific picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtjVZU"&gt;On the face of it, the Canon Powershot PX simply looks too expensive for the features it offers. As we found when reviewing the Clip, no amount of on-device intelligence (or, I would wager, mechanical movement, as with the PX) will capture pictures and videos that rival those you consciously snap on your smartphone. But hopefully we’ll be able to test the PX for ourselves later, and find out if it can really offer something different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYW0Ke"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nude-friendly Google Photos folders coming to iOS next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34Gq87AVuAYSd-eNoopaWVZO-NQ=/75x0:1176x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70061269/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_10.46.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Locked Folders feature was announced at this year’s Google I/O.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UZIpjH"&gt;Google is expanding several of its privacy and security features including Google Photos’ secure Locked Folder feature, the VPN offered alongside Google One, and the Pixel’s new centralized security hub. The plans were detailed in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe-online-never-done/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; rounding up the company’s security initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NBvI1"&gt;For starters, Google Photos’ Locked Folder feature, which currently lets Pixel owners hide sensitive photos and videos in a passcode- or biometric-protected folder, is coming to iOS “early next year.” The feature launched for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524661/google-photos-locked-folder-private-videos-available-pixel"&gt;Pixel 3 and later in June&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689322/google-photos-locked-folder-passcode-protected-sensitive-images"&gt;late September&lt;/a&gt; Google said it would be releasing for all Android phones “soon.” Now we have a timeframe for when Google Photos users on iOS will be able to protect sensitive images like nudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bw2GCm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel’s Security Hub is also planned for more Android devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XWr8y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618267/google-one-vpn-international-expansion-canada-mexico-uk"&gt;Google One’s VPN service&lt;/a&gt; is expanding to 10 new countries this week: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. The service is already included at no extra cost with 2TB and up Google One cloud storage plans in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dr5Yl"&gt;Finally, Google has confirmed that it plans to release the &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/10/pixel-6-setting-new-standard-for-mobile.html"&gt;Security Hub&lt;/a&gt; that debuted on its new Pixel 6 phones on all Android phones. The hub is designed to offer a simple overview of the security of your device, and give warnings if settings like Find My Device or a Screen lock aren’t enabled. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/27/android-12-security-hub-pixel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the feature has been appearing on older Pixel devices running Android 12, and now Google says it has “plans to roll this out to [its] entire ecosystem in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is testing a new tipping feature for some creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BloIrJb01R4VyVvVSXhiD_EgcwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70060373/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T9zGE5"&gt;TikTok is experimenting with a new tool that allows TikTok users to tip some creators directly on their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wiqs7I"&gt;According to a video of the tips feature shared this week by &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jera.bean?lang=en"&gt;TikTok creator Jera Bean&lt;/a&gt;, who noticed the feature in-app and applied for approval, any money tipped to creators will go directly to that individual (meaning TikTok won’t take a cut). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UTLm4"&gt;A screenshot of the application screen stated that in order to qualify for the feature, accounts must be in good standing on the platform, have at least 100,000 followers, meet an age requirement, and agree to TikTok’s tips terms. If creators meet these criteria, they can then apply for the tool — though it's unclear whether everyone who applies will be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CBKyJ6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@jera.bean/video/7024254778150636846" data-video-id="7024254778150636846" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@jera.bean" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jera.bean"&gt;@jera.bean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;✨TIKTOK NEWS AND UPDATES✨ the TIP feature: more info! &lt;a title="tiktokupdates2021" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktokupdates2021"&gt;#tiktokupdates2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="tiktokupdates" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktokupdates"&gt;#tiktokupdates&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="tiktoknewfeature" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktoknewfeature"&gt;#tiktoknewfeature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Time (Instrumental) - MKJ" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Time-Instrumental-6621360381879126786"&gt;♬ Time (Instrumental) - MKJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="upFROK"&gt;Based on a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jera.bean/video/7024254778150636846"&gt;follow-up video&lt;/a&gt; from the same creator shared Thursday evening, the application process seems to move fairly quickly. Jera Bean’s account now displays a “tips” button that directs users to a page where they can tip the creator $5, $10, $15, or a custom amount of their choosing (minimum $1). Additionally, the platform allows tips to be sent anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5SsAe"&gt;“We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” a spokesperson for the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-direct-tipping-feature-with-select-creators/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported the news earlier&lt;/a&gt;, citing Jera Bean’s initial video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz7xoa"&gt;Users must be 18 years or older to send tips to creators, but it doesn’t appear that users have to actually be following the account they’re tipping to use the feature. It is, however, being tested on a limited basis for the time being. TikTok declined to comment on how widely available the feature is to creators on its platform at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fT59f"&gt;In the first leaked images of Facebook’s smartwatch, it’s clear: there’s a &lt;em&gt;notch&lt;/em&gt;, which is the kind of thing people love to make fun of, and what appears to be a front-facing camera. In the photo, the watch’s screen is off, but the beady little camera eye is clearly visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62n742"&gt;The photo, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/leaked-photo-shows-meta-s-planned-competitor-to-apple-watch?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;which was first reported on by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; was found inside the company’s app for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Ray-Ban Stories&lt;/a&gt; smart glasses. The watch, referred to as “Milan” in the code, has a large display like the Apple Watch — but that smartwatch doesn’t have a camera. The picture today may not be a version that consumers ever see, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg. &lt;/em&gt;Still, it confirms earlier reporting about Facebook’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrWsVh"&gt;If this is the same watch as the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"&gt;we reported on in June&lt;/a&gt;, there will also be a second, detachable camera. The front-facing camera may be used for video calls, and has a reasonably high 1080p resolution. The watch will support LTE. In February, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported that the watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280798/facebook-smartwatch-messaging-health-fitness-release-date"&gt;will have health, fitness and messaging features&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zomEjt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook plans first smartwatch for next summer with two cameras, heart rate monitor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="431RCS"&gt;In June, the plan was to launch the device in Summer 2022, though &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s source says there hasn’t yet been a final decision on release timing yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Fek7z"&gt;The smartwatch market is dominated by Google, Garmin, Samsung, and Apple. So to distinguish itself, Facebook’s offering is meant to mimic a smartphone more closely. Underscoring the rivalry, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made several jabs at what he called “closed platforms,” possibly referring to Android and iOS, during &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XOn2CZWnxxY?t=4517"&gt;Thursday’s Connect keynote&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this week, in its earnings call, Facebook partially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;blamed Apple’s ad-tracking features&lt;/a&gt; for missed revenue targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAydb8"&gt;Earlier today, Facebook rebranded its parent company Meta. But a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5277128/metawatch-meta-premium-smartwatch-brand"&gt;MetaWatch from 2014 &lt;/a&gt;already exists. With any luck, this will mean weird lawsuits around branding and intellectual property — and the legal discovery that goes along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsESiy"&gt;The company formerly known as Facebook declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will the Oculus Quest still require a Facebook account? It’s complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lb8MIuR1AX5XiCnE3TrSktRFhS0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059958/akrales_200904_4160_0208.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iy8sJn"&gt;Facebook (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;now called Meta&lt;/a&gt;) knows a lot of virtual reality headset owners hate logging in with Facebook. Requiring Facebook logins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;created bad blood&lt;/a&gt; almost immediately and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518194/oculus-quest-2-headset-facebook-account-suspension-problems"&gt;accidentally locked some people&lt;/a&gt; out of their Quest VR hardware in late 2020. And at today’s Connect keynote, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hinted the restriction might be ending. But his comments raised more questions than they answered, and we still don’t know exactly what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVWZt8"&gt;Zuckerberg mentioned the changes while talking about work applications for VR. Here’s what he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kbghFn"&gt;“As we’ve focused more on work, and frankly as we’ve heard your feedback more broadly, we’re working on making it so you can log into Quest with an account other than your personal Facebook account. We’re starting to test support for Work Accounts soon, and we’re working on making a broader shift here within the next year. I know this is a big deal for a lot of people. Not everyone wants their social media profile linked to all these other experiences, and I get that, especially as the metaverse expands. And I’ll share more about that later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8QzwqP"&gt;Oculus Quest headsets — which will soon be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;known as Meta Quest headsets&lt;/a&gt; — have required a Facebook account since 2020. (Until the Quest 2’s release that year, users could choose to log in with either Facebook or a separate Oculus-branded account.) Some information gets shared across the services, and you’ll see Facebook social options in VR, although you can maintain separate user profiles and friends lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxGptO"&gt;This choice was so controversial that it apparently helped inspire Meta’s rebranding. Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-mark-zuckerberg-about-the-metaverse/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stratechery’s&lt;/em&gt; Ben Thompson&lt;/a&gt; that the backlash added a sense of “urgency” to get Facebook’s name off the company as a whole. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth also noted the issue after Connect. “As we’ve heard feedback from the VR community more broadly, we’re working on new ways to log into Quest that won’t require a Facebook account, landing sometime next year. This is one of our highest priority areas of work internally,” Bosworth &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491"&gt;wrote in a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQRKzz"&gt;But there’s a wide spectrum of possible changes that Meta could make, and only some of them would address critics’ underlying complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQ1hck"&gt;Facebook has so far committed to one limited change: if you use the enterprise-oriented Quest for Business program, which will begin testing in the coming months, you’ll be able to sign in with Facebook’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-products-for-the-next-era-of-personalized-experiences"&gt;Work Accounts&lt;/a&gt; system. Businesses had a similar option under the earlier Oculus for Business program, so this is more of a feature reshuffling than a practical advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoIRiq"&gt;Zuckerberg and Bosworth suggest that’s not the only change we’ll see, but Facebook is being cagey about the details. When I directly asked if users will be able to log into Quest headsets (or the Horizon “metaverse” platform) using something besides a personal Facebook account &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a Facebook Work Account, a spokesperson only reiterated Zuckerberg’s statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMK3wC"&gt;Facebook’s “broader shift” could involve little more than renaming “Facebook accounts” to “Meta accounts” or “Horizon accounts.” And any version of it will probably ask you to hand some data to Facebook. But a more meaningful change could address a few major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tIUzzF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Initial setup requirements.&lt;/strong&gt; Zuckerberg committed during Connect to letting you sideload VR apps from outside Meta’s official store, but you currently can’t reach that point without a Facebook-based initialization process. While it doesn’t seem incredibly likely, Meta &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; introduce a bare-bones setup that offers basic headset features without creating any kind of account — so you could sideload media the way you would on a laptop or other electronic device, bypassing the online Meta/Facebook ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1SysyX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Logins for schools, festivals, and other non-business organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; Lots of schools, film festivals, and other organizations use VR headsets. Typical business accounts won’t necessarily provide the best fit, and neither would personal accounts of any type — even if they’re not specifically &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; personal accounts. Facebook has acknowledged and promoted all these use cases, so Meta is probably at least thinking about this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T5AUvH"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Public-facing profiles and “real” names. &lt;/strong&gt;Joining Facebook means creating a profile that makes your “real” legal name (along with some limited profile data) accessible to anybody else on Facebook. Even if you provide a credit card with your name for internal app purchases, any meaningful login change should let you create a Meta account that nobody else can look up, and like non-Facebook Oculus profiles, it shouldn’t use your legal name as your default username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yfTV9W"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data partitioning.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you log into Facebook and your Quest with different accounts, the same company owns both of them. Facebook has long reserved the right to cross-check different accounts against each other so it can ban spammers or stalkers from multiple services at once. But Meta should let you explicitly silo the data in each account — so there’s no risk of your Facebook News Feed engagement generating recommendations on the Quest store, for instance, or of Facebook revealing a pseudonymous VR friend’s identity by recommending that you follow their Facebook account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vXVdGM"&gt;Meta is clearly aware of the critiques of its account policies. But based on executives’ statements so far, it could be months until we hear more about its plans for addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google makes waitlists for Pixel 6 Pro because it can’t keep the phone in stock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6N6bqlBERQlzi3p1lX5C5XSGEYE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059916/akrales_211020_4802_0323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vu0U7S"&gt;After what seems like an eternity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;teases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;reveals&lt;/a&gt;, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are finally on sale. But Google seems to be running very low on inventory, as the company now offers waitlists so you can be notified of when the phone will be available again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuUcic"&gt;Right at the top of the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro page on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a now banner advertising the waitlist. “Due to high demand, some Pixel 6 Pro models may be out of stock or have long delivery times,” the company says. “Get notified when they’re back in stock, or check out other authorized retailers who may have them available.” The banner includes buttons to join the waitlist and see other retailers where you can try to get the phone instead. After clicking the buy button &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US"&gt;on the Pixel 6 Pro page&lt;/a&gt;, I was also able to join waitlists for both the unlocked black and gold models with 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoMBUdv7THhA_4U2-6-W4hwsojw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964727/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_2.42.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s notice about Pixel 6 Pro inventory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ECLapc"&gt;That said, the Google Store’s stock doesn’t seem to be entirely depleted. While writing this article, I saw unlocked models of all three colors come in stock a few times (though I sometimes wasn’t fast enough to check what storage you could pick from). The Google Fi version of the 128GB black model was available at one point. If you’re a Verizon customer, it appears you can still pick from many Pixel 6 Pro color and storage options. (I am not a Verizon subscriber, so I can’t take one of those models all the way to my cart to confirm if it’s actually available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbAi0N"&gt;We asked Google about the fluctuating stock situation. “The banner on the Pro page on the Google Store is still accurate — some models of the Pro are out of stock,” the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “While we work to make more available, customers can check out our authorized partners nationwide while supplies last.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtJxoX"&gt;This is all to say that it seems &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to get a Pixel 6 Pro from the Google Store if you really want one. If you’re striking out at Google’s store, you might want to see if they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734748/google-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; — otherwise, you can always join Google’s waitlists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an incredible life-size Ghostbusters Proton Pack prop you can actually buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXwEZngORwL6ayTwOWrgd1vtu98=/153x0:2403x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059907/ghostbusters_haslab.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a hook for the wand, but it’s sold separately.&lt;/em&gt; | Hasbro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rNX4Vd"&gt;You’ve always wanted your very own &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; Proton Pack. Your options have been: find a cheap toy, 3D print, sand and paint your own, pay for someone to do it for you, start with a premade kit, or painstakingly build something even more intricate from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHUXr0"&gt;Here’s a sixth way that might be the easiest and most cost-effective yet: pay Hasbro $400 for &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/collections/haslab/products/ghostbusters-plasma-series-spengler-s-proton-pack"&gt;this incredible-looking thing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V6YbLscPNzrDS3rtVa_x5USAEfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964766/F5226_PROD_GHB_Tango_02698_1500x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pack at an angle, covered in lovely shiny bits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwSNTUXk88VUy13mgaGAMPEP3F0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964800/F5226_PROD_GHB_Tango_02744_original_1500x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical shoulder and belt straps plus what looks like a lumbar pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n2Iu8V"&gt;Hasbro says the Ghostbusters Plasma Series Spengler’s Proton Pack is based on 3D scans of the actual movie prop from &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s complete with lights, sounds (from both 1984 and 2021), a cyclotron you can open up and dismantle, a full set of straps so you can wear it, and apparently an incredible amount of fantastic weathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVVTML"&gt;I reached out to my &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;-loving friend for context, who’s been trying to build his own for years, and he was impressed by the price, pointing out that &lt;a href="https://macksfactory.myshopify.com/products/pp101-proton-pack-body-kit"&gt;you can easily pay $400&lt;/a&gt; just for a competent body kit to help you build your own, let alone a finished product with this level of detail, and the cost of &lt;a href="https://www.gbfans.com/shop/pack-parts/"&gt;all the bits you’d need for the full effect&lt;/a&gt; can add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6cvxpMDVfbcrMdUcY63SqWhftJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964793/249554929_1347662312303167_1222699879126391046_n.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I hear &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://macksfactory.myshopify.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mack’s Factory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a popular parts destination for Proton Pack builders.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9OTuSE"&gt;Still, if you buy Hasbro’s version, you’ll have the same one as everybody else who does, and some take pride in building their own, just like there’s a community of fans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/12/3759042/star-wars-han-solo-blaster-prop-replica"&gt;reaching for the perfect replica of Han Solo’s DL-44 blaster&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/10/11371902/star-wars-lightsaber-fx-sabers-custom-luke-skywalker-graflex"&gt;the perfect Star Wars lightsaber&lt;/a&gt;. And you’ll still need to figure out how to add a plasma wand: &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/ghostbusters-plasma-series-spengler-s-neutrona-wand-premium-collectible?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlOmLBhCHARIsAGiJg7nTTFRQ1knVHhb6SGsGg-wF-P-dLkwbKOR8tU4aHY2NHSrxjuGZ_BkaArn2EALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;kid=39700059628823809"&gt;Hasbro’s $125 version&lt;/a&gt; is sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VEloHJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The greatest Star Wars lightsabers in the world are built by fans","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/10/11371902/star-wars-lightsaber-fx-sabers-custom-luke-skywalker-graflex"},{"title":"The neverending quest for a perfect Han Solo DL-44 blaster replica","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/12/3759042/star-wars-han-solo-blaster-prop-replica"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qWqcIk"&gt;It also could be quite a wait: this crowdfunded toy / prop isn’t scheduled to ship till spring 2023. You’ve got until December 12th of this year to decide if you’re in — with these HasLab products, the company is only promising a single production run.

    <title>Amid the fluff, Meta showed an impressive demo of its Codec Avatars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zg_6gUA42IKcFk_sncD9d_x_Pw=/240x0:2640x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70059609/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_12.12.29.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6wyJE3"&gt;Meta, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;formerly known as Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, held a presentation today where it announced its rebranding and showed off what it imagines the future of computing will look like — but amid all the fluff, it actually had some interesting tech demos. The first showed off its life-like Codex avatars and an environment for them to exist in, which the company says was rendered in real-time and reacted to real-world objects. Mark Zuckerberg also talked about the company’s work with neural interfaces that let you control a computer just by moving your fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ln7TUX"&gt;We’ll discuss the demos in just a moment, but it’s really worth seeing them for yourself. You can check them out &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookrealitylabs/videos/561535698440683/?t=10291"&gt;on the Facebook keynote archive&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XOn2CZWnxxY?t=3684"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;’ YouTube stream&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer that interface.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i93fk9rsraSFKk5yWTgUBD0DPqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964553/avatar_demo.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to Meta, this is both a virtual avatar and a virtual environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="eyT9zo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z5O2K2"&gt;During the presentation, Meta showed off the work it’s been doing on &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/codec-avatars-facebook-reality-labs/"&gt;its Codec Avatars&lt;/a&gt; to give users better control over their eyes, facial expressions, hairstyles, and appearance. The company also showed off the ability to simulate how the avatar’s hair and skin could react to different lighting conditions and environments and even how it was working on interactive clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1D0SUW"&gt;The presenter made it very clear that this tech is “still very definitely research,” and it’s no wonder — there’s an immense amount of hardware required to make one of the avatars, and Meta’s likely using very high-powered computers to render it. But it’s at least exciting to see that Meta’s goal is to let us render ourselves with graphics equivalent to what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date"&gt;cutting-edge video game engines are capable of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ddjL2y-9jkZz9OIWykJA53yPxRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964185/fb_real_time_environment.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to Meta, this was rendered in real-time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KDb1Bq"&gt;The company also showed off its real-time environment rendering, which it said would eventually be a place for you to use your avatar to interact with others. The system also lets people interact with real-life objects, with the changes being reflected in the virtual world. While realistic environments are nothing new, being able to make changes to them in the real world and see those changes happen in a virtual one makes for a really cool demo (even if the tracking points added to the real-life objects are a bit distracting in how much they stand out). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ot9NUuyY7HXl8d6zyjYvERxbjo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964246/FB_Marketing_EMG.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meta’s “illustration” of what the neural interface might do in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wpi9St"&gt;As for the neural interface, Meta’s relying on something called electromyography, or EMG, to turn the signals your brain is sending to your hand into computer commands. It showed off the wristband it uses to do this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and the demo Meta gave today didn’t really show off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433516/ctrl-labs-brain-computer-interface-armband-hands-on-preview"&gt;anything that wasn’t around&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 when it bought a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;called CTRL-Labs&lt;/a&gt; and acquired its tech, but it’s still good to see that it’s being worked on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/itkAbEFFcrmHvNSVkGFbPc0shgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22964236/FB_Research_EMG.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The actual prototype Meta researchers are using.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cfARZQ"&gt;Meta has said that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577095/facebook-bci-ucsf-chang-lab-brain-typing-research-update-project-steno-ar-vr"&gt;pursuing EMG input instead of brain-reading devices&lt;/a&gt;, so it may have been showing off the way you interact with its future devices. Compared to visions of people playing VR ping-pong for an audience of avatars, this felt like the most realistic thing Meta showed off Thursday. That doesn’t mean the Oculus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;er, Meta, apparently&lt;/a&gt;) Quest 3 will come with an EMG wristband, but in a sea of hype without much substance, its demo and the other actual research Meta showed off was a sight for sore eyes. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XOn2CZWnxxY?t=3684"&gt;Check them out&lt;/a&gt; if you’re looking for a break from the rest of the Facebook / Meta news.&lt;/p&gt;
