    <title>Among Us devs aren’t happy with Fortnite’s blatant copying</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cC7cAEG-jotqQqw8tibIDSu9-0s=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740795/amongus.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s2Vhc9"&gt;Epic Games launched &lt;em&gt;Fortnite: Impostors &lt;/em&gt;yesterday, a new mode that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;copies the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; game mechanics&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, the multiplayer game that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;soared in popularity&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the pandemic, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456688/among-us-pc-free-epic-games-store"&gt;free on the Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt; recently, Epic didn’t collaborate with Innersloth, the studio that created &lt;em&gt;Among Us, &lt;/em&gt;for the new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; mode. The developers behind &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; are clearly surprised and unhappy that Epic has copied their game so blatantly, with social deduction gameplay and a very similar map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k1YZa"&gt;“It would’ve been really, really cool to collab,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheVTran/status/1427725915870699521"&gt;said Victoria Tran&lt;/a&gt;, Innersloth community director. “Like game mechanics, fine, those shouldn’t be gatekept, but at the very least even different themes or terminology makes things more interesting?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yvFeCQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;     &lt;a href="https://t.co/wTESWQHJZD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wTESWQHJZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gary Porter (@supergarydeluxe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supergarydeluxe/status/1427717779914989569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RNNkxd"&gt;Gary Porter, a developer for &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, also pointed out the similarities between the map that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; uses and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s okay though they flipped electrical and medbay and connected security to the cafeteria,” joked Porter on Twitter. “I wasn’t even around for the development of Skeld [the first &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; map] and I’m still kind of offended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YYIpg"&gt;Calum Underwood, another developer on &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, tweeted and deleted what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevRelCallum/status/1427787105674145792"&gt;he referred to&lt;/a&gt; as “spicy tweets,” before then &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevRelCallum/status/1427756105380339721"&gt;inviting other game makers&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate with &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;instead. &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/among-us-devs-arent-feeling-fortnite-s-new-impostors-1847505281"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku &lt;/em&gt;also spotted&lt;/a&gt; that Adriel Wallick, a programmer at Innersloth, also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MsMinotaur/status/1427717612780367877"&gt;shared a comic&lt;/a&gt; about the theft of art online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LRy0ls"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We didn't patent the Among Us mechanics. I don't think that leads to a healthy game industry. Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?&lt;/p&gt;— Puff (@PuffballsUnited) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PuffballsUnited/status/1427781760692068355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b8p530"&gt;Innersloth co-founder, Marcus Bromander, said the company didn’t patent Among Us mechanics as “I don’t think that leads to a healthy game industry.” Instead, Bromander expected Epic to put more effort into their own spin on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqBUN0"&gt;Epic’s Impostors mode in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has obviously taken the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; team by surprise, even if it’s only a temporary mode in the game. The not-so-subtle hints at copying and art theft here come after small creators have accused Epic of stealing their work in the past. Epic has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184401/epic-games-fortnite-dance-emote-legal-lawsuit-2-milly-carlton-floss"&gt;years of legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; related to emotes that the company copied from children and independent artists without paying for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfhALd"&gt;Epic’s choice to copy &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; also comes just months after the company’s bitter legal battle with Apple. It’s a legal fight that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369622/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ban-basic-freedoms-developers"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has described&lt;/a&gt; as about “basic freedoms of all consumers and developers.” It’s not a great look if Epic is fighting for small developers in one sense, but undermining them elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft Singapore probed by national watchdog after toxic workplace allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49TwPRW63wjnIHXTfyRD6xY34z4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740738/acastro_190528_1777_ubisoft_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qhJDpT"&gt;Ubisoft Singapore, the lead studio on &lt;em&gt;Skull &amp;amp; Bones&lt;/em&gt; and co-developer of &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, is being investigated by a national employment watchdog over allegations of misconduct at the studio. Singaporean newspaper &lt;a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/ubisoft-spore-under-probe-over-workplace-complaints"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the country’s Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) began its investigation after receiving anonymous feedback about conditions at the studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNl2Pe"&gt;The probe follows a wide-ranging &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-stalled-reckoning-at-an-assassins-creed-co-d-1847336158"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last month based on conversations with over 20 current and former employees about the studio’s allegedly toxic workplace environment. Sources said female employees were sometimes subjected to unwanted physical contact, and that subsequent investigations from HR would drag on for months and result in minor penalties. The studio is also alleged to suffer from racial disparities, with local employees unable to progress past a so-called “French ceiling” at the Paris-headquartered company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yA0Ntr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of many Ubisoft studios where misconduct has been reported&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZmiYn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that such investigations usually involve interviews with affected parties, and can result in civic or criminal sanctions. Civil sanctions may include blocking the studio from applying for new work passes for foreign employees, while more serious infractions can lead to a criminal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNeU5C"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Ubisoft said it was aware that feedback had been sent to the TAFEP, but said it couldn’t comment on the probe while discussions were still ongoing. “Every Ubisoft studio, including Ubisoft Singapore, strives to create and foster a culture that team members and partners can be proud of,” the company said. “We do not and will not tolerate discrimination or abuse. We celebrate our international culture and work to ensure our teams are deeply integrated into their respective local communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEbY9E"&gt;In response to last month’s report from &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;, the company said 40 percent of expert and senior expert roles at Ubisoft Singapore are filled by Singaporeans or permanent residents. “Our objective is to continue to increase Singaporean leadership through various programs including a dedicated management learning path to accelerate the development of new leaders,” it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEsJeF"&gt;In an August 6th press conference, Ubisoft Singapore’s managing director Darryl Long, who  took over leadership of the studio said that the company “[needs] to start to change the way we are perceived and the way we act internally as well,” &lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKYoCu"&gt;The allegations of misconduct at Ubisoft Singapore have taken place against a backdrop of widespread reports of toxicity across Ubisoft as a whole. An anonymous survey of nearly 14,000 employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499334/ubisoft-employees-workplace-misconduct-ceo-yves-guillemot-response"&gt;published in October&lt;/a&gt; revealed that as many as a quarter of them have seen or experienced workplace misconduct, with 20 percent saying they didn’t feel “fully respected or safe in the work environment.” However, despite several high profile employees being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368787/ubisoft-fires-former-assassins-creed-valhalla-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-allegations-misconduct"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353197/ubisoft-fires-tommy-francois-allegations-sexual-harassment"&gt;the company&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Yves Guillemot has said that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430738/ubisoft-black-lives-matter-harassment-diversity-inclusion"&gt;real change will take time.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6eQD5"&gt;Meanwhile, competitor Activision Blizzard is currently embroiled in a sexual harassment controversy of its own, having been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;recently sued by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms it’s removing ads from its stock apps later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI on the Galaxy S21 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIC6twemoCU-toVQEoHayEe1l_k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740638/vpavic_210119_4377_0157.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $1,199 Galaxy S21 Ultra, which showed ads in its default apps.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f39xKq"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that it will stop showing ads in default apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme. It follows comments made by its mobile chief TM Roh in an internal town hall meeting &lt;a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210817140800017"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Yonhap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Samsung has made a decision to cease the advertisement on proprietary apps including Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, and Samsung Theme,” the company said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “The update will be ready by later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ObzCj"&gt;“Our priority is to deliver innovative mobile experiences for our consumers based on their needs and wants,” the company said. “We value feedback from our users and continue our commitment to provide them with the best possible experience from our Galaxy products and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6jD8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Samsung has made a decision to cease the advertisement on proprietary apps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoQ1j"&gt;In our review of this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, we said it was unforgivable that Samsung would choose to show the “kind of ad that’s normally at the bottom of a crappy, overloaded website” in its default weather app. Yes, it’s been possible to dodge or disable these ads and switch to non-Samsung versions of each app, but you shouldn’t be expected to have to do that after spending $1,199 on a flagship smartphone. They’re part of the reason why Samsung’s otherwise clean One UI software has started to feel messy over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2xeRB"&gt;Samsung did not share a specific date for when the ads would be removed from its software, but &lt;em&gt;Yonhap &lt;/em&gt;previously reported that the change will be made via a forthcoming One UI software update. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/samsung-ads-removal-report/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has published&lt;/a&gt; a collection of screenshots if you want to see just how bad Samsung’s apps currently look.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus updates its overkill gaming phones with Qualcomm’s new overkill processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Rzppsh87OfdfCkOC3FJDdPovzE=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740485/msedge_5BtFPuHiJl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro has a small display on its rear.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQXU7w"&gt;When you’re selling high-spec gaming-focused phones, it makes sense to have the most powerful processor possible. At least, that’s the only explanation I can come up with for why Asus would announce its new Snapdragon 888 Plus-powered ROG Phone 5S lineup, just months after releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;the original ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnwlOA"&gt;There are two new S-branded phones, the &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/phones/rog-phone-5s-model/"&gt;ROG Phone 5S&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/phones/rog-phone-5s-pro-model/"&gt;ROG Phone 5S Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;888 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, more responsive 360Hz touch-sampling rate, and increased &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Ftw%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FROG-Phone%2Ffilter%3FSeries%3DROG-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22630283%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;maximums of 18GB RAM and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, the 5S appears to be &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/compareresult?productline=phones&amp;amp;webpathname=ROG-Phone-5s,ROG-Phone-5&amp;amp;id=130291,120644"&gt;a very similar device to the ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt;. That means it’s also got a 6.78-inch 144Hz display, 6,000 mAh battery, and triple rear cameras with a 64-megapixel main sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xOQSRu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both feature more responsive displays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U1uY3d"&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro is a similar upgrade. It’s also been bumped up to the 888 Plus, has the same faster touch-sampling rate, and up to 18GB of RAM. Otherwise this is a very similar gaming-focused phone to the 5 Pro, complete with neat additions like extra touch sensors on its back and side to offer more controls while gaming. Check out our review of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year for an idea of how these features work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhIeyg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/08/16/asus-rog-phone-5s-5s-pro-launched-18gb-ram-snapdragon-888-plus/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the two new phones are only available to order in the Taiwanese market for now, where they’ll ship next week on August 24th. The Asus ROG Phone 5S starts at NT$ 29,990 (around $991), while the 5S Pro starts at NT$ 37,990 (around $1,364). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fuchsia OS is rolling out to every first-gen Nest Hub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKbPE1HHVX8HLdD06p_qmdP96j0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740371/dseifert_181018_3039_1192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbstyr"&gt;Google has started to push out the silent upgrade to its new Fuchsia operating system on first-gen Nest Hub devices (known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;the Google Home Hub on release&lt;/a&gt;), meaning the secretive project will be broadly used by consumers after years of opaque development. The OS, which unlike Android isn’t based on Linux and uses a microkernel called Zircon, was previously made available to some devices enrolled in a preview program back in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mT1EX"&gt;Now, Google has &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/google-fuchsia-update-rolling-out-widely-nest-hub/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a new firmware update for non-preview Nest Hub devices includes the Fuchsia upgrade, meaning that all first-gen devices should be running Fuschia already or very soon. I just checked the one on my desk — which Google explains how to do &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7365257?hl=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; — and sure enough, turns out it’s on Fuchsia right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="08we3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is still making its mysterious Fuchsia OS, and now it wants your help","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163225/google-fuchsia-os-call-contributors-mailing-list-governance"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Qq4LLI"&gt;You might’ve thought I’d have noticed that a device that I look at and interact with every day is running an entirely new operating system, but Google is attempting to make the experience as close to identical as possible. Even the pokey performance on the first-gen Nest Hub appears to be very similar, for better or worse. The only way to know you have Fuchsia is by checking the “About device” section of the settings menu, and even then the OS isn’t mentioned by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gOBEx"&gt;That means that the first widespread Fuchsia deployment isn’t quite as exciting as the possibilities imagined when word of the project first started getting out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/15/12480566/google-fuchsia-new-operating-system"&gt;more than five years ago&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, it’s quite impressive that Google has managed to seamlessly replace the core software of a popular product in a way that most people won’t ever notice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say goodbye to Intel’s RealSense tech by remembering its incredible demos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intel-Project-Euclid-Robot-RealSense-Module-2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coDfxM4UygNib8NrcgWCJ22C51Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738886/verge-2017-08-17_14-32-52.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fPtQIQ"&gt;Intel’s RealSense computer vision tech will soon be going away, as the company is “winding down” the business, &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-says-it-s-shuttering-realsense-camera-business?itc=refresh"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CRN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t remember the tech from January of this year, where Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217480/intel-realsense-id-facial-recognition-encrypted-camera-depth-sensing"&gt;pitched it as a way to create facial recognition systems&lt;/a&gt;, you may remember it from some incredible tech demos (or possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/8/8366421/dell-venue-10-7000-tablet-video-specs-price"&gt;a few devices&lt;/a&gt;, if you were really paying attention).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Duinal"&gt;Now that the tech is on its way out, perhaps it’s a good time to look back at some of the cool ways we’ve seen it shown off to remember the good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B4tBOs"&gt;CES 2013 — Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3848012/intel-nuance-voice-face-interface"&gt;talks about&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851368/we-try-intels-perceptual-computing-play-portal-2-with-a-wave-of-the"&gt;demos&lt;/a&gt;, what it calls “perceptual computing.” The company pitches its tech as a way to interact with your computer by moving and talking, and the next year...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rO2R7V"&gt;CES 2014 — Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281120/kinect-like-cameras-are-coming-to-your-next-laptop-or-tablet"&gt;announces its RealSense 3D cameras&lt;/a&gt;, which it says will bring Kinect-like motion tracking to laptops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SFQliu"&gt;CES 2015 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7505803/intel-realsense-technology-can-make-every-device-self-aware"&gt;Intel shows off&lt;/a&gt; a self-flying drone and a jacket that’s aware of the wearer’s surroundings, powered by RealSense. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wubDIa"&gt;CES 2016 — We see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10717406/intel-ionvr-vr-headset-realsense-smartphone-developer-kit-ces-2016"&gt;a preview of a VR headset&lt;/a&gt; that uses RealSense to map the wearer’s real-life environment, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724564/yuneec-typhoon-h-drone-intel-photos-video-ces-2016"&gt;a drone that uses the tech for obstacle avoidance&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724248/fallout-4-mod-uraniom-face-intel-realsense-ces-2016"&gt;puts Dieter into &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using a RealSense scan of his face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aI9aaX"&gt;August 2016 — Intel announces a RealSense module that’s designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/16/12504678/intel-project-euclid-robots-realsense-module-tiny-computer"&gt;give robots the ability to “sense.”&lt;/a&gt; The company also introduces a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12503948/intel-project-allow-vr-headset-cordless-mixed-reality"&gt;wireless VR headset called Project Alloy&lt;/a&gt; that it says will blend real and virtual worlds with help from RealSense motion tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P4rbJU"&gt;November 2016 — Intel lets &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/18/13673084/intel-microsoft-project-alloy-vr-headset-first-look-mixed-merged-reality"&gt;try Project Alloy’s “merged reality” headset&lt;/a&gt;, which uses RealSense. At CES 2017 it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/8/14202270/intel-project-alloy-vr-merged-reality-headset-update-ces-2017"&gt;demos a third generation of the headset&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/22/16351900/intel-project-alloy-vr-merged-reality-headset-reference-design-discontinued"&gt;“wind[s] down” the project later that year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TXvzSu"&gt;CES 2021 — Intel announces &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/turn-touch-interface-touchless-realsense-tcs.html#gs.q0dzl7"&gt;RealSense Touchless Control Software&lt;/a&gt;, which it pitches as a way to make public kiosks controllable by gesturing in the air, instead of by touching a screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4gc6nd"&gt;Literally a week ago — Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618043/xiaomi-cyberdog-robot-dog-quadruped-specs-price"&gt;unleashes its robot dog&lt;/a&gt;, which uses RealSense for depth sensing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IdGuyl"&gt;For the most part, the demos were just that — cool applications that didn’t usually end up in the hands of consumers. There were a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/18/9173609/intel-razer-realsense-streaming-vr-camera-announce"&gt;actual RealSense products&lt;/a&gt; over the years, but they rarely held up to what we saw at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y62NLP"&gt;Intel &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-says-it-s-shuttering-realsense-camera-business?itc=refresh"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CRN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll still be fulfilling its obligations to RealSense’s current customers, but said that the employees working on RealSense will be transitioning to other roles more focused on Intel’s core tech. Most people, though, will probably remember RealSense for the cool demos and the promise of easy, drop-in computer vision that didn’t quite seem to work out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5OUYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this story implied that Project Alloy was announced in 2017, the same year it was canceled. It was actually announced in 2016. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Spectrum TV app is back in Roku’s channel store after being yanked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b19ZeMMImEU9BSzoCgZTKyFlO-o=/0x9:1200x809/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738808/roku_verge.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FVnxJX"&gt;Roku users who’ve been unable to get Charter’s Spectrum TV app through the platform’s channels store can once again do so after months of being unable to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTEjMA"&gt;Roku &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/spectrum-tv-app-roku"&gt;announced on its blog today&lt;/a&gt; that new and existing users can access Spectrum TV on its devices by signing into the app using their Charter broadband credentials or by signing up for an account through Roku. The agreement resolves an ongoing carriage dispute that resulted in Roku pulling the Spectrum TV app from its store in December. The companies issued a joint statement on Tuesday that both had come to “a mutually beneficial agreement to renew distribution of the Spectrum TV App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Grqngx"&gt;“As a result of the renewal, the Spectrum TV App is now available for download from the Roku channel store,” the companies write. “We are pleased to renew our partnership and offer this great streaming experience to our shared customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9qCV4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The app was yanked from Roku’s channel store in December&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VRQWl1"&gt;When the app was pulled from Roku’s store in December, users who already had it installed could continue using it without service interruption. However, any new users hoping to access their service through the platform were out of luck. Spectrum offered a &lt;a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/roku-no-longer-allowing-new-downloads-of-spectrum-tv-app-in-carriage-dispute"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; at the time that despite its “best efforts to reach an agreement, Roku has not accepted Spectrum’s offer to continue our contract.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmkovA"&gt;Neither company offered any further details about the agreement, but Roku’s seen similar support disputes before — even with some of the largest players in streaming. In April, Roku &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;pulled YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; from its store, though Google soon after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425035/google-youtube-tv-roku-app-feud"&gt;added support&lt;/a&gt; for its live TV service to the primary YouTube app, giving its users a workaround. Notably, HBO Max didn’t arrive on the Roku platform until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/21272058/hbo-max-roku-watch-wonder-woman-1984-movies-amazon-fire-stream-comcast-warnermedia"&gt;December of last year&lt;/a&gt;, roughly half a year after the service officially launched. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mf1iSedqg7lPxNv9m2aiQTzVyPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738574/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6g9tj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 17th, 6:04PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony appears to have sold out of PS5 consoles for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXr3jW"&gt;Sony began releasing a fresh batch of PlayStation 5 consoles through its online storefront today at 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT. Both the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;$499.99 version of the PS5&lt;/a&gt; that can accept discs and the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-digital-edition-console.3005817"&gt;discless version that costs $100 less&lt;/a&gt; are currently available for order, however, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to purchase one if you make it through the public queue, which can take an upwards of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsneZZ"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with Sony’s ordering process, it uses a slightly better queuing system that automatically places you in line if you’re on its site when the sale goes live. Consoles still tend to sell out quickly, as they have done since the console launched late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vd7KH8"&gt;If you’re looking for tips on securing a PS5, be attentive, listen for the audible chime, and hope that luck is on your side. Oh, and be sure to log into your PlayStation account and enter your shipping and payment information ahead of time. Sony says that it’ll ship the console for free if you purchase something alongside it in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XTs87f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="4NPUEh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yTzmyN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XG78YS"&gt;What good is a PS5 without extra games and accessories, though? As mentioned before, Sony will give you free shipping today if you check out with an extra item in your cart in addition to the console, so check out the games and accessories below to see if there’s something you might want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vYRQ4W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zO8eAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10694744"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Zyhxh1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="L3VsQ7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="caYPnc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>There’s still a place for the Note in Samsung’s Galaxy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung has filled out its S-Pen ecosystem of apps nicely." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avsTsud09fJpQdJ5U6vR6EzyvvU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738502/dbohn_201004_4226_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJ5Xmw"&gt;For the first time in many years, August will come and go without the introduction of a new Galaxy Note smartphone from Samsung. Instead, with their lower prices and improved durability, the company is giving its latest foldables — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; — a firm push into the mainstream phone market. With the Z Flip selling for a penny under $1,000, it’s certain to stand out from the iPhone and Samsung’s own Galaxy S21 devices that cost a similar amount (or more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjvXvv"&gt;But for repeat buyers of Notes past and present, it does feel like there’s something missing. We’re talking about the brand that established Samsung as the leading manufacturer of huge phones. Yet the company has completely skipped producing a new Note this year and has tried to explain it away with a simple “not this time around.” For now, the lineup isn’t gone; last year’s Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra will remain for sale in 2021. The latter remains a legitimately excellent phone today, so even with Samsung hitting pause for a year, at least there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeKddK"&gt;Samsung’s stance on the Note’s future is vague enough that it leaves room for an eventual return &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620397/samsung-fold-flip-future-galaxy-s-past"&gt;if foldables don’t become the next big thing&lt;/a&gt;. But I’d argue that at least one traditional Galaxy phone with a stylus should remain in the company’s plans regardless. It’s too soon to move on from everything that Samsung was doing so right, and tacking S Pen support onto its other flagship phones doesn’t quite live up to the Note’s legacy. And there are several reasons for the company to give it another go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PmckpE"&gt;People seem to like stylus phones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UJXu2I"&gt;The Note is no doubt the de facto stylus smartphone, but other companies have also found success. Motorola has said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; quickly became the most popular device in the G-series after its release, and that was enough for the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;produce a 5G-capable sequel&lt;/a&gt; this year. And before LG’s complete exit from the smartphone market, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;its Stylo phones&lt;/a&gt; were some of its more popular mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkdzYW"&gt;You can’t overstate the importance of a built-in silo for storing the stylus away when it’s not being used. On the Note, the S Pen is there when you need it — for drawing, signing a PDF, or whatever else — and then it’s gone and completely unobtrusive when you don’t. No add-ons or special phone cases required. Those latter solutions only add friction that can take away from the whole appeal. Using a phone case is perfectly fine, and most people do, but trying to incorporate a stylus slot there is far from ideal if you’ve got normal-sized hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZAfKgY"&gt;The Note deserves a better swan song than the Note 20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MEFoBH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; was true to the line’s usual recipe of stellar build quality, high-end specs, and a giant screen. But the regular Note 20 was a poorly executed misfire. Samsung’s strategy of pursuing a slightly lower price point made sense, but there were enough compromises with last year’s regular Note that it was difficult to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NitFnM"&gt;Most glaring of all was that it had a 60Hz display, when even cheaper Samsung phones like the Galaxy S20 FE had evolved to smoother refresh rates. The cameras were worse, it had a plastic back, and all of these tradeoffs were made to reach a still-expensive price of $999.99. In the eyes of many Note fans, it was a frustrating mismatch, and they rejected the Note 20 for it. Marques Brownlee went so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exk34o-MMIE"&gt;call it the “Nope 20.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEbqoh"&gt;This was particularly disappointing after Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20845028/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-s-pen-camera-specs-features-price"&gt;got it right the year prior with the Note 10&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t saddled with the same number of disappointing concessions. That device felt like it was meant to be a mini version of the larger, flagship Note 10 Plus. But the Note 20 came off more as an example of what happens when a company cuts too many corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Pgg2cE"&gt;A case is an imperfect solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="REO0KF"&gt;Samsung hyped the addition of S Pen support when it announced the Galaxy Ultra S21 earlier this year. And the experience of &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the stylus seems to be on par with a Note. But then you’ve got to &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; it somewhere, and that’s where there’s no substitute for an actual Note. Without a designated slot on the phone itself, Samsung’s solution was to make a case that could keep the S21 Ultra and S Pen together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PryxSk"&gt;However, it came with a downside: worse ergonomics. As Dieter wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;S21 Ultra review&lt;/a&gt;, the phone can feel more manageable in your hands than an iPhone 12 Pro Max because it’s taller and narrower. That easier-to-hold advantage is diminished somewhat by Samsung’s silicone case for the S Pen. Since there’s a permanent holding spot for the stylus on the case’s left side, the device is noticeably larger.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung bundled the S Pen with a case for the S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kgCiau"&gt;For the Z Fold 3, Samsung came up with a case design that places a holster at the hinge. I think this will work out better, since the Fold is more narrow than most smartphones (including the S21 Ultra) when closed — so it won’t feel as unwieldy even with the added space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9L1q7"&gt;But unless third-party case makers come up with their own options, you’ll be limited to that one specific Samsung case if you want to carry the S Pen with minimal risk of it being lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tNbHhi"&gt;Selling the S Pen separately makes it feel like an afterthought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8x3gkZ"&gt;Even though it went to the trouble of creating a “Fold Edition” S Pen with a retracting spring tip, Samsung won’t be bundling that with its latest flagship foldable. Rather, you’ve got to buy it (or the pricier S Pen Pro) separately. The Fold Edition comes bundled with its specially designed case for $79, while the S Pen Pro is sold standalone for $99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42tNGI"&gt;An S Pen still comes included with many of Samsung’s latest tablets and laptops. But making it an added purchase on top of the $1,800 Z Fold 3 will probably lead some people to pass on it entirely. If the Fold is meant to usher in a new era of smartphone productivity, why not toss the Fold Edition stylus and case in the box? Maybe that’d ease the sting of not getting a phone charger, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuuVsG"&gt;Another Samsung stylus phone could be great if done right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="e68mX2"&gt;I hope that last year’s models won’t be the end of the line for the Galaxy Note. Samsung still hasn’t come up with an alternative that matches the coherence and convenience of a phone designed with the stylus in mind from the very beginning. But where should the company go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrc7lm"&gt;I could see Samsung choosing the “special edition” route (think Apple’s iPhone SE, but high end) and releasing a new, top-spec Note every few years for the diehard fans that will pay top dollar for their giant slab of glass and S Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aon35j"&gt;But an even better development would be if the stylus trickled down to at least one of Samsung’s popular A-series phones and brought more people into the experience — for much less money. That’d be a clear sign that Samsung is committed to the S Pen, even if the Galaxy Note itself remains on hiatus. The benefits of a stylus shouldn’t be reserved for the $1,000-and-up tier. You’d want a high refresh display since that does genuinely improve the responsiveness of drawing and note-taking. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Galaxy A52 already checks off that box&lt;/a&gt;, so we know it’s possible even if the company wants to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8BfJJ"&gt;Part of the problem with the Note 20 was Samsung’s messaging: it tried to pass off midrange hardware as something more premium. The pushback and so-so reviews shouldn’t have come as a surprise. But Samsung wouldn’t need to over-sell a Galaxy A-series phone with a stylus: it could be a hit all on its own merits. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KViuqO"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/This-Week-on-Stadia-Big-releases-Big-deals-Big-week/ba-p/66265"&gt;offering a new promotion to YouTube Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt; — three free months to try the games included in Stadia Pro, as long as you’re a new subscriber (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/youtube-premium-stadia-pro-offer/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While there’s a chance someone willing to pay to remove ads from YouTube may have already messed around with Stadia, three months is a solid amount of time to see if cloud gaming makes sense for you, and it’s two months longer than Stadia’s usual free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pql7ut"&gt;The deal comes with a few caveats, naturally. Besides limiting the free months to new subscribers, Google is also only offering the promotion in the following countries: the US, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. You can claim the offer until January 31st, 2022, and you have until February 14th, 2022 at 9AM PT to redeem it, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/10693693"&gt;according to Google’s fine print&lt;/a&gt;. If you cancel, expect to be charged Pro’s $9.99 per month price once the three months ends and to lose access to any games you didn’t purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wThyw8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stadio Pro’s library of games is eclectic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mIH1lL"&gt;Stadia Pro includes the benefits of a game library and higher resolution video quality for the games you stream, though it’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/games"&gt;the current selection of games&lt;/a&gt; you can claim for free is a bit... eclectic. There are beloved modern entries like &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;, smaller indie titles like &lt;em&gt;Floor Kids&lt;/em&gt;, and classic options like &lt;em&gt;Killer Queen Black. &lt;/em&gt;For most newer releases, you’ll have to purchase them outright, and you can find quite a few things to play that way. Stadia Pro subscribers typically get a discount, too.  Even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;Google’s taken a step back from Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22624023/stadia-direct-touch-control-scheme-humankind-stadia"&gt;continues receiving interesting new releases&lt;/a&gt; to purchase in its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUFUU5"&gt;You can redeem the free three months starting today. Stadia also offers games like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/every-game-you-can-play-free-stadia"&gt;to try for free with just a Google account&lt;/a&gt;: no need to provide a credit card just to find out if Stadia works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
