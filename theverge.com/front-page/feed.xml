    <title>Netflix’s mobile gaming platform spreads to Spain, Italy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RWFDh5"&gt;It has only been a few months since Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;confirmed plans to include games as part of its subscription&lt;/a&gt;, and after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642946/netflix-mobile-games-in-app-android-users-poland-stranger-things-1984-3"&gt;an initial test in Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the streamer is opening its selection of Android titles to customers in Spain and Italy. While Netflix has had some promotional titles before, with tie-ins recently revealed for everything from Oculus VR to PC gamers on Steam, this experience is built directly into its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xD1bzl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The rollout continues! Today members in Spain and Italy will see Netflix Games available on their Android phones. We’re still in the early stages of our gaming experience, however here’s a snapshot of what’s new… &lt;a href="https://t.co/LHaQJmCBvn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LHaQJmCBvn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1442865946931040256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjsHzj"&gt;The Netflix games test is only available on Android at the moment, while tweets from its localized accounts for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixES/status/1442856482127634435"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixIT/status/1442866775851372545"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; show it still works by pushing customers to the Google Play Store. There, they can install the titles that are playable as part of their normal subscription. After they’re installed, players can launch them from the main Netflix app, but it’s not like watching a movie since players are shifted over to the game’s own app. There are five games to choose from: &lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops, Card Blast, Teeter Up, Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaOO5h"&gt;One important change is visible already in the screenshots, as the gaming section has received its own section in the bottom navigation bar, which should make it more visible to people simply browsing the app. When they announced the effort in July, Netflix execs said, “Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscription at no additional cost, similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRrCNd"&gt;Today’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1442865946931040256"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; indicates the company is “still in the early stages of our gaming experience,” without revealing anything about when it might be available in the US. If you’re desperate for hints, the most telling factor is probably that it’s in English.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Package alerts come to Ring’s wired doorbells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5va60agsnJ_vGfFz97cVGR84Co0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920872/dseifert_20210323_4486_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Ring Pro 2 video doorbell (pictured) and the Ring Video Doorbell (2020) will now be able to tell you when a package is on your doorstep.  | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K03c9F"&gt;Ring is bringing package alerts to its Ring video doorbells, and it’s about time, too. This is a much-requested feature that’s already found on most of its competitors’ camera doorbell offerings. When the main selling point for a product is that it will deter porch pirates, it’s kind of important to be able to keep a virtual eye on those packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UjgaN"&gt;The pings that will tell you when a package is on your porch will start rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;Ring Pro 2&lt;/a&gt; and Ring Video Doorbell (2020) in the US and internationally today and should arrive on other buzzers next year. But this still doesn’t address a big issue with most of Ring’s doorbells; the cameras’ wide viewing angles often don’t pick up the spot where the package is left. Only the Pro 2 has a head-to-toe view for seeing the whole porch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_knnMUMfe3Pm_OPE5jz4MY5cN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884281/Package_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Pro 2 is the only Ring doorbell that can show you a head-to-toe view, which is useful for seeing packages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="trcpZF"&gt;Along with playing catch-up in the industry it invented, Ring has a new trick up its sleeve: Custom Event Alerts. This feature lets you create your own alert based on the information you want to know. For example, is the garage door open? Is the car in the driveway? Is the front door shut? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59NRh"&gt;Custom Event Alerts will only be available on the Spotlight Cam Battery and are scheduled to arrive later this year. Both Package Alerts and Custom Event Alerts require a subscription to a Ring Protect plan (starting at $3 a month or $30 a year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q6jvQh"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Ring custom alerts demo video|104114" data-volume-uuid="48c385801" data-volume-id="104114" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-242" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BapcvU"&gt;Ring says the custom alerts work by having you train your camera on the two states you want it to recognize, such as when a garage door is left open or closed or when a car is in the driveway or not. The computer vision algorithm processes images of the scene in the cloud and sends an alert when it sees a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcIUPc"&gt;“You can literally build your own detector — there’s so many neat things to do with it,” said Ring founder Jamie Siminoff in an interview. He taught a camera to tell him when his HVAC compressor was on or off. “I was having problems with the outdoor compressor and was able to train it to tell me if the fan was spinning or if it wasn’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYXn7G4dSx_TbWjhPm6cLT7e3fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884280/Custom_Event_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new feature on the Ring Spotlight Cam lets you create custom event alerts to tell you when the state of something changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnRKzK"&gt;The camera uses computer vision and machine learning to figure out the difference between the two states and should then recognize when that state changes and alert you to it. This type of AI-powered motion detection is the next arms race in the smart home. Companies are competing to find the best way to send their users fewer annoying alerts in favor of more relevant, useful ones from their smart home cameras. And what’s more relevant than an alert you create yourself and custom design for your home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv2cGw"&gt;To date, Ring has been behind here, partly hampered by a reliance on battery-powered tech, which energy-intensive smart alerts can swamp. Category leaders such as Arlo and Google Nest already offer package, people, animal, and vehicle alerts, but Ring could well be the first to let you create your own. This is a bold claim, however, and we won’t know if it holds up until we’ve been able to test it ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now you can pay Ring $99 a month to watch your cameras for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4qZGku1xSFDdeBciiSVszUkr2s=/0x467:1779x1653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920858/Virtual_Security_Guard.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring has announced a new service that has professional security agents monitor your Ring cameras&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mNbFyJ"&gt;Ring revealed its latest ambitious security product today: real-life people watching over your home. Taking the concept of monitored security to the next level, Ring’s Virtual Security Guard is a new subscription service that lets agents at a professional monitoring center respond to specific motion alerts on any outdoor Ring camera and take action for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y8Ns9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/products-innovation/virtual-security-guard-a-new-service-offering-peace-of-mind-when-you-are-out-of-range"&gt;Virtual Security Guard&lt;/a&gt; requires a Ring Alarm home security system to work (Gen 1, 2, or Pro) and costs $99 per month on top of a $20 monthly Ring Protect Plus subscription for professional monitoring. It works with any of Ring’s wired, outdoor cameras (including all the wired doorbells, the Spotlight Cam, Stick-up Cam and the floodlight cameras). You choose which are monitored through the Ring app, and when a camera detects a motion event while the Ring Alarm is armed, the monitoring company is alerted and responds based on what it sees. The agent will use a series of guidelines and your preferences to tailor a response and can use features like the camera’s two-way talk to communicate with a visitor, turn on the siren, or send emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xf-t4_5GZ8JOVtZ6HGj5dNMAja4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882517/20210820_lifestyle_professional_monitoring_adobestock_304603525_rgb_1x1__2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you trust Ring to watch your security cameras for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vXo22s"&gt;If the agent sees someone they think is up to no good, they will first use two-way talk to let the person know they are being monitored and ask them to leave. If they don’t go, the agent will sound the siren in the camera and continue monitoring while dispatching emergency services. At this stage, they also call and text the property owner with a link to the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7eEaM"&gt;You can only enroll outdoor cameras at launch for obvious privacy concerns. If you try to add a camera that’s inside, the monitoring company is supposed to stop monitoring it until it’s reconfigured outside, Ring tells us. Of course, this relies on the human agent to flag the issue, a potential stumbling block for privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jkod9o"&gt;The Virtual Security Guard isn’t a form of visual verification for the Ring Alarm system (which is when the monitoring service can view a live feed on your cameras if something triggers one of your alarm sensors) as it can’t monitor any cameras when the alarm is triggered. Its sole purpose is to monitor when motion is detected on an outdoor camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWjgHO"&gt;“Visual verification is something we’ve looked at, and we’ll continue to look at. This is a level up from visual verification, which is really about once something’s happened,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in an interview ahead of the announcement. “This is much more proactive; this is a virtual security guard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMjE6J"&gt;The monitoring service can only access a live view once motion is triggered and while the Ring Alarm is armed; agents can’t view camera feeds when the alarm is disarmed, and they can’t download, share, or save videos. In the Ring app, there will be a tag on any video that a human has reviewed. At launch, the service will be offered by &lt;a href="https://www.rrms.com/"&gt;Rapid Response&lt;/a&gt;, the professional monitoring company the Ring Alarm uses but will expand to additional providers at hopefully lower prices, says Ring. Virtual Security Guard is available in the US for &lt;a href="https://www.ring.com/virtual-security-guard-real-time-monitoring"&gt;early access, starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj2Err"&gt;The concept here is to take the onus of responding to your camera’s motion alerts off you and put it on to someone else. If your Ring Alarm sends you a notification at 2AM that there’s a person out back, chances are, you’re going to miss it, or if you see it, you’re never getting back to sleep. Now, the Virtual Security Guard can view the event that triggered the alert, and if it turns out to be a non-event, you get to stay tucked up in dreamland. “Even with the advances in AI and machine learning, I’m not sure how far they can go to make sure you always get the only alert that matters and wakes you up,” said Siminoff. “This way, you have that extra line of defense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BbDhF1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the Ring app, there will be a tag on any video that a human has reviewed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLKIXT"&gt;It can also work for peace of mind as you arrive or leave your home. Ring president Leila Rouhi described a scenario she experienced at her home while testing out the service. There was a commotion in her front yard when she was arriving home, and her dog ran off after another dog. “There was a little bit of mayhem in front of my door, and the agent checked in and asked, ‘Hey, is everything okay? Is there anything we can do for you?’” she explained. “Thankfully, the situation was under control, but it felt really nice to know that, in an emergency situation, if something bad were happening, there is somebody who is looking out for you and can take action if you need them to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0DuZG"&gt;Ring’s track record when it comes to Ring employees viewing camera footage is spotty at best. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177305/ring-employees-unencrypted-customer-video-amazon"&gt;A 2019 report&lt;/a&gt; indicated that Ring let employees watch and share unencrypted customer videos with each other. However, privacy advocate Pam Dixon, Executive Director of the &lt;a href="https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/"&gt;World Privacy Forum&lt;/a&gt;, has reviewed the Virtual Security Guard service and told me that she believes Ring and Amazon have exceeded best practices here. “They’re doing background checks for the monitoring agents, and I am also reassured by the bias training they are giving them,” she said. “I don’t know of another company that does that. That gives me real comfort that this product will not peddle bias, which is a big plus.” Ring also told her that it will be doing regular audits of the monitoring agents. “I feel comfortable with this,” she continued. “But if it were cameras inside the home, that would be a different situation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6ozoD"&gt;Dixon pointed out that there are many groups of vulnerable people for whom tools like Virtual Security Guard will be an excellent resource. “We work with a lot of victims of domestic violence — and a lot of survivors invest heavily in security tools so they can be notified when someone breaches their safety.” She also sees its usefulness when you’re away on vacation, for example, and don’t want to be constantly monitoring your phone. But for most people, a virtual security guard for your home is probably overkill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAt9oO"&gt;And it looks like Ring is aware of this, and is targeting Virtual Security Guard more towards small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which are already using Ring Alarm products to secure their premises, according to the company. “Hiring an in-person security guard is not something that’s possible or sustainable for a lot of small businesses,” she said. “With Virtual Security Guard, you have that level of service at a much more affordable price.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon marries Ring and Eero in a neat, white package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdTDemyzT-rSDJHnVLpd_48b3_0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920854/20210621_us_lifestyle_insitu_alarmpro_keypad_credenza_rgb_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro is the latest generation of Ring’s home security system and features a built-in Eero mesh Wi-Fi router.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;With 24/7 internet backup and on-board video processing, too, this Z-wave alarm system is now a serious smart home hub&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KPq06A"&gt;Smart home company Ring has announced the third generation of its popular budget Ring Alarm home security product. The Ring Alarm Pro is a single device combining Ring’s security system with an Eero Wi-Fi router, 24/7 internet backup, and local processing and storage for Ring cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdwFu4"&gt;This all-in-one device is designed to offer physical home security as the base station for Ring Alarm’s Z-wave sensors and digital security through the cybersecurity features Eero offers in its Wi-Fi system. It also acts as a smart home hub for compatible third-party gadgets, such as door locks, thermostats, and smoke alarms. And, with a new processor on board, the Ring Alarm Pro can connect to Ring cameras to process and store videos locally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2c6jRhqG4gixZfHHmB18Ik6oBic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881783/20210414_image_device_alarmprobasestation_wht_tabletop_angled_1500x1500_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Larger than the original Ring Alarm, the Alarm Pro is 6.63 x 6.63 x 1.56 inches and is powered by a USB-C connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6tPYDT"&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro costs $249.99 for just the base station or $299.99 for an eight-piece security kit including contact sensors, a motion detector, a keypad, and a Z-wave range extender. Ring claims you will be able to swap out an existing Ring Alarm Base station without having to reconnect all your devices, and pre-orders start today in the US only, with shipping beginning November 3rd. The second-generation Ring Alarm is sticking around at $199 for a five-piece kit for those who don’t need these new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wf2qSj"&gt;Along with the new hardware come new subscription packages. A new Ring Protect Pro subscription for $20 a month (or $200 a year) is designed to use with the new Ring Alarm Pro. This is a new level of Ring Protect that includes the local storage feature, a new 24/7 backup internet option, and an Eero Secure subscription, in addition to the cloud storage, professional monitoring, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454582/amazon-alexa-guard-plus-subscription-service-security-price-release-date"&gt;Alexa Guard Plus&lt;/a&gt; that is part of the existing Ring Protect plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ZN9Ilk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is really the first time we’ve all rolled up our sleeves and developed a product together.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7fdos"&gt;Ring also announced a portable version of Ring Alarm Pro designed for job sites, such as construction sites. The system leverages the cellular connectivity and Eero Wi-Fi capabilities to keep cameras and sensors online in places where you might not have internet up and running yet. It can be set up at one site and then dismantled, packed in a specially designed case and taken to the next job. &lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/products-innovation/ring-jobsite-security-a-new-way-to-secure-job-sites"&gt;The Ring Jobsite Security Kit &lt;/a&gt;starts at $399.99 and can be pre-ordered at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FHomeDepot.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22692073%2Fring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HomeDepot.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brV8oY"&gt;This consolidation of services for your home — security and internet connectivity — is a smart move by Amazon, the parent company of both Ring and Eero. And it is notable as the first time Amazon has brought two of its smart home brands together into one piece of hardware. “This is really the first time we’ve all rolled up our sleeves and developed a product together,” Nick Weaver, CEO, and co-founder of Eero, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Simplifying and converging things makes a lot of sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM1Jjw"&gt;For Ring, the move was designed around providing security for the digital side of our lives, as well as the physical. “Historically, we’ve been focused on the physical security of our neighbors (customers),” explained Jamie Siminoff, founder of Ring. “But we’ve seen over the last few years how so many things have moved to digital — everything from money to pictures. We felt that, as a company whose mission is to make your neighborhood safe, just securing the physical things was no longer enough; we had to add the digital as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="lrn1d0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776125"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z5gXSA"&gt;There is a lot going on with this product. And while the words “smart home hub” were conspicuously absent from the pre-announcement conversations I had with Ring and Eero on the Ring Alarm Pro, this is a white plastic box packed with smart home communication protocols that lets your devices talk to each other. Its specs include two Ethernet ports, Bluetooth for setup, a Z-wave radio, 2.4 GHz and 5Ghz Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6, LTE, and a 902-928 MHz Radio (it’s Sidewalk-ready, but it’s not turned on). So, yeah, it’s a smart home hub — and a powerful one at that, although somewhat hampered by being firmly locked into the Ring / Amazon Alexa ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvaRKO"&gt;The headline feature here is the built-in Eero router, as this is the first time Eero has put its TrueMesh technology in any non-Eero branded device. It’s not the first time we’ve seen a router in a smart home hub (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098872/samsung-connect-home-wifi-router-announced-smartthings-price-release-date"&gt;Samsung’s Connect Smart Wi-Fi system&lt;/a&gt; combined mesh Wi-Fi with a SmartThings Hub). Still, the idea of merging a router and smart home / security hub helps simplify things for many everyday consumers — the clear target audience for Ring and Eero here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHjtXq"&gt;Case in point, the Eero inside the Ring Alarm Pro is an Eero 6, not the more advanced Eero Pro 6. It’s capable of speeds up to 900Mbps over 1,500 square feet, but those speeds drop to around 500Mbps if you add more Eero nodes to create a mesh. The Pro offers gigabit speeds throughout the network, and while you can add Pro nodes to the Ring Alarm Pro network, the Eero in the Alarm Pro will need to be the main gateway connected to your ISP. “But if you’re getting less than 500Mbps [from your ISP], there’s really no benefit to having the Pro 6,” Weaver explained. “Unless you have a lot of devices on your network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2Fj8A"&gt;From a security perspective, the Eero Secure service included in the $20 a month Ring Protect Pro Plan adds a layer of digital security to your network. “With Eero Secure, we’re basically ensuring that all the devices on your home network are staying safe and secure. So, you know, it blocks different attacks, helps you enable parental controls, and protects you from phishing,” said Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJf5wZ"&gt;As an alarm system, the Ring Alarm base station does everything the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21215231/ring-alarm-second-generation-update-preorder-features-emergency"&gt;previous generation does&lt;/a&gt;. It can connect to Ring’s sensors and compatible third-party Z-wave devices to monitor your home for intrusion, water leaks, and fire — and send emergency police, fire and medical response in the event of an incident if you pay for 24/7 professional monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hxrvf"&gt;The most significant change on the Ring side is that the new base station can now be a hub for Ring’s cameras. A new processor in the device enables local processing of videos from Ring cameras via a service called Ring Edge. “With local processing, we can do edge-based computer vision processing,” explained Mike Harris, COO of Ring. “We’ve got a whole ton of ideas that we want to put this thing to work for.” Edge-based processing means the data is processed locally rather than being sent to the cloud, helping increase speed and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AhRWKk-EbfOT6M67TwXjjT0uBlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881786/20210621_us_lifestyle_insitu_alarmpro_secuirtysystem_livingroom_rgb_16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro base station connects to Z-wave security sensors in your home.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AB50NE"&gt;Ring Edge also enables local storage of video through a removable microSD card (a 64GB that can hold around 47 hours of clips is included; you can use cards up to 512GB). It is part of the $20 per month Ring Protect Pro plan, so it’s not a workaround to avoid paying a monthly fee to view your camera feeds. However, it can help take the pressure off your bandwidth, and you can pick and choose which of your cameras stay local and which use the cloud to store and process video. Local videos will not be stored in the cloud, but as long as the microSD card is installed, you can view them in the Ring app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADNQSo"&gt;Local storage does not unlock the option of 24/7 video recording, however. That’s a feature other security camera systems offer but has been missing from Ring since the beginning. Ring Alarm Pro’s local storage is compatible with all of Ring’s current cameras except the Ring Video Doorbell (1st Gen) and Stick Up Cam (1st Gen). It won’t be available on Ring Video Doorbell 4 and Floodlight Cam Wired Pro at launch, but the company says it will be coming soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0n1TF"&gt;There are also improvements around the Ring Alarm’s backup capability. The Ring Alarm Pro works with a new Ring Power Pack to provide longer uptime, and its high-speed LTE connection can keep your whole Wi-Fi network online, not just your Alarm Pro. The Power Pack has an 8550mAh battery rated at 10.8V and 92.34Wh and costs $129.99. It connects to the Pro via USB-C to extend its battery life by up to eight hours. You can daisy chain up to four power packs to keep your system up and running for a little over two days. Ring says the Ring Alarm Pro only works with its power packs, so you won’t be able to use a third-party USB-C battery instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0undLFOJR1nrsXjMpgq2INw9-o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881788/20210521_image_device_alarmprobasestation_powerpack_wht_front_stacked_1500x1500_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring’s new Power Packs connect via USB-C to the Ring Alarm Pro base station to get you an additional 8 hours of battery-back-up when the power goes down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lv9FIH"&gt;The built-in, high-speed LTE backup for your entire Wi-Fi system is perhaps the most interesting feature here. “The cellular backup went from LTE that was useful for the local connection for backing up your alarm devices to a high-speed connection that can back up basically everything on your Wi-Fi network,” explained Harris. It’s fast enough to keep your internet connection up and running in the event of a power outage and / or internet outage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0R9iW6"&gt;The Ring Protect Pro plan includes up to 3GB of cellular data per month, with the option of extra data for $3 per gigabyte. It’s capable of keeping your entire Eero network online if you want, but within the Ring and Eero apps, you can designate which devices you want to stay online, so you don’t inadvertently eat up all that expensive data because your internet went down while you were streaming Netflix in 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE1DBx"&gt;This type of built-in redundancy can be handy on a daily basis to alleviate cries of pain from your kid’s bedroom when a power blip kicks them out of their latest Fortnite battle or prevent your Zoom call from dropping at that crucial moment. But it could really come into its own in an emergency situation, such as an evacuation due to a hurricane or wildfire. Knowing you can check in on your battery-powered security cameras and still stream live and recorded video for at least two days after power and internet have gone down (assuming cellular networks are still up) is a compelling use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23VHdW"&gt;Viewed as a whole, the Ring Alarm Pro is a big leap forward in the smart home security space. While we’ve seen smart security systems that offer smart home features from several companies, such as Abode, Simplisafe, Vivint, and ADT, this product takes the concept of smart home security to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPogXE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Viewed as a whole, the Ring Alarm Pro is a big leap forward in the smart home security space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4R3VP"&gt;But for homes that don’t need or want a professionally monitored security system, this is overkill. And there’s no easy way to separate the features here: everything is bundled into that Ring Protect Pro plan. If you already have a powerful mesh Wi-Fi network setup and don’t turn on the Eero in the device, then you lose access to that 24/7 backup internet feature, as well as the online protections, as it’s only available for devices connected to the built-in Eero network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLKHl7"&gt;For the smart home user, there is also a glaring piece of the puzzle missing: Zigbee. Unlike in the other Eero gateway devices, there is no Zigbee chip for enabling smart home devices to connect to your Amazon Alexa smart home system. The Ring Alarm Pro does have Zigbee on board — it’s been in the Ring Alarm since its first iteration. But it’s not turned on, and there is no support for OpenThread. “We may enable Zigbee on Ring Alarm Pro in the future,” says the company. “If a customer wants Zigbee Smart Home Hub or Thread support today, they can add an Eero 6 router or any Eero Pro 6 device to their network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaQ2Ip"&gt;We’re also concerned about managing all these new features through the already bloated, confusing, and very slow Ring app (seeing as Ring launched an app called Rapid Ring to more quickly access your camera feed, it’s clear the company knows this is an issue). While the Wi-Fi management stays separately in the excellent Eero app — everything else is routed through Ring, which could be an exercise in frustration. If there ever was a moment for Ring to launch a fully-featured web interface, it is now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gemldY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard not to see the Ring Alarm Pro as a compelling product at a good price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yqNIO"&gt;It’s hard not to see the Ring Alarm Pro as a compelling product at a good price. It neatly wraps up some of the key aspects of the modern, connected home into an easy-to-use package. It does lock you into the Amazon / Ring / Eero world, but with the coming of Matter, that may not be as much of an issue as it once was. Ring wouldn’t confirm its participation in Matter and the Ring Alarm Pro, but Harris did say that Ring is “definitely part of all of those conversations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAXkPC"&gt;This is also a big move for Amazon, consolidating its disparate smart home brands into a cohesive hardware package and connecting them by more than just the company’s Alexa voice assistant. From Ring’s perspective, it makes a lot of sense to have a reliable Wi-Fi router in its hardware. Keeping its Wi-Fi cameras connected to a strong enough signal in customers’ homes has been a major challenge for the company from day one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hid2VU"&gt;For an initial outlay of $250 and monthly costs of $20 covering professional monitoring, digital security, and internet backup, we see a lot of value here. How much that value is worth in the real world will have to wait until we’re able to get some first-hand experience with the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwNeXb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Chromebook 2021: Lenovo Chromebook Duet" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pDnq5iKvs1snl7mnQ956GJOyu90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19978538/mchin_200512_4018_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyoOMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 one of the best Chromebooks of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Best Chromebook for midrange shopepers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pvusIr"&gt;The Lenovo Flex 5 looks a lot nicer than its sub-$400 price might indicate. It’s built to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, but also has a smooth soft-touch texture that’s pleasant to hold. Add a sleek backlit keyboard, a physical webcam shutter, and front-facing speakers, and you’ve got a chassis with hallmarks of a much more expensive device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y79cZK"&gt;You get some other perks as well. The Flex 5 has one of the better keyboards I’ve ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook at a midrange price point. It also has a useful port selection including a microSD reader and a USB-C port on each side, as well as a crisp 1920 x 1080 touch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD2vyD"&gt;The one caveat is that the Flex 5 has somewhat disappointing battery life, averaging just over five and a half hours in our testing. If you’ll be using the device while you’re out and about, you’ll want to make sure you bring the 45W charger with you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Hey Disney’ is a custom voice assistant coming to Echo devices in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SE0v49rc9OpVuyZoaEPGWOOoq7Q=/320x0:3776x2304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920830/heydisney.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has partnered with Disney to create a custom voice assistant.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cdqEce"&gt;Amazon and Disney announced a custom voice assistant called Hey Disney that’s going to be available on Echo devices installed at Walt Disney resort locations, piggybacking on the skills of Alexa. Unlike Amazon’s in-house assistant, Hey Disney is ultimately used for customer service inquiries, helping Disney World or Disneyland visitors find answers to park-specific questions. Disney says this new wake word will “make the Alexa experience more magical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1fgAD"&gt;There was no onstage demo of the assistant, but it seems like it’ll work as you might expect it to. By saying “Hey Disney,” you can ask it questions like “what time does the park open?”, “where can I get Italian food?”, or use it to request more blankets for your resort room. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MyQMObTY-GI_nJh2y4iUHpgiNpc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884834/heydisney3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hey Disney command will be available on Echo devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0W4T1c"&gt;The Hey Disney custom voice assistant is also available to people who aren’t staying in Disney parks. Amazon says it can provide jokes, fun facts, and over 1,000 “magical interactions” presented by Disney characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuCIzB"&gt;The skill will be launched in 2022, and a price hasn’t been shared yet. It’ll be complimentary for people staying at Disney parks, but you’ll need to pay to put it on your own Echo device. But if you want to get your home ready for Hey Disney, you can check out OtterBox’s new Mickey accessory for the Echo Show 5. It’s available for preorder now for $24.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring’s security drone could be flying in your home soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DpiMO_sOqal1SlPAyd7QIDd4h2c=/0x0:6075x4050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920820/49339_12021hesby_09e_lifestyle_product_hovering_0308_R3_RGB_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring’s Always Home Cam security drone is ready for takeoff.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ngbeZJ"&gt;First announced at last year’s Amazon hardware event, the Ring Always Home Cam is now ready for take-off. Starting today, September 28th, you can request an invitation to be a crash-test dummy for Ring’s newest innovation. The Always Home Cam is a Ring camera attached to a drone that can fly predetermined paths in your home when triggered via a Ring Alarm sensor or from the Ring app. The camera costs $249.99; if you live in the US, you can apply for &lt;a href="https://ring.com/always-home-cam-flying-camera"&gt;an invitation to buy it&lt;/a&gt; today, and the devices will ship later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BjxoL"&gt;Designed to solve the problem of wanting to be able to see inside your home when you’re not there but not wanting to have dozens of cameras watching you when you are, the Always Home Cam only records when it’s in flight. When not in use, it sits in its charging dock that blocks its lens. It can fly to specific viewpoints on demand — such as the front door or kitchen stove — and can also tie into a Ring Alarm home security system and buzz over to any action — such as a door or window opening when the alarm is armed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DUhntZ9ECJy92_tNzCv_df2QjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882429/49339_11802hesby_01a_lifestyle_product_livingroom_table_0194_R4_RGB_1x1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Always Home Cam sits in a charging base when not in use, where its camera is disabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1h5aS"&gt;In the year since it announced the product, Ring has been working on refining the ambitious device and essentially making sure it won’t go on a rampage through your home. “It’s not an overstatement to say we’ve made a thousand refinements to it,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff said in an interview ahead of the announcement. “We learned how to fly.” While they had working prototypes when they announced in 2020, it’s only now ready for regular people’s homes, says Siminoff. But not everyone’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KErIoP"&gt;Ring is rolling out the invite-only program as a sort of post-beta test flight. “I have it in my home, and it does work,” said Siminoff. “But today’s homes are so unique, so we really need to get it into more customers’ homes to make sure everything we are doing is right.” After all, it is an autonomous flying machine in your home. “With any other product, we would have probably just been shipping. With this one, we are going to take our time, make sure it’s right before we go to full, general availability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3g3I5"&gt;The invite-only program, which is a recent trend with Amazon products, is a way to attract the right type of customer to the product at this stage, says Siminoff. “It’s a customer that’s willing to and wants to work with us,” he said. “They understand what they’re getting into. We use this as a tool to deliver the best products to customers and be transparent with them.” So, does this means if it crashes into your big screen TV, you’re just plumb out of luck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IcaIgImKI5JHNXo3rmIT0EqVE-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882432/20210922_lifestyle_ots_backyard_fcc_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home security drone can be controlled through the Ring app, or respond autonomously to events in your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YNtWSn"&gt;In terms of day-to-day use and features, much of what was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; is the same. The Always Home Cam is an indoor-only camera attached to a drone with enclosed propellers. It streams and records video in 1080p to the Ring app. It is fully autonomous and can be commanded to fly on-demand to pre-set locations through the app or programmed to take off when Ring Alarm detects a disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGyV8a"&gt;It only records in-flight, and the drone makes an audible noise, so it’s clear when footage is recording. It has obstacle avoidance technology, but its shrouded propellors should prevent any serious damage if there is a collision (“But you should keep it away from your Van Gogh,” joked Siminoff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lm9eQL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Ring Always Home Cam demo video|104113" data-volume-uuid="d5072579f" data-volume-id="104113" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-248" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9QA7G"&gt;The Always Home Cam is designed for use on a single floor, as it can’t navigate stairs. But Siminoff says multi-floor support is something the company is exploring. It should also only fly when there is no one home. While the drone has been tested with ceiling and tabletop fans, Siminoff said it might have difficulties if a fan is blowing full speed. “But if it feels like it’s not doing the right thing, it’ll just land in a safe area and sit there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pw3mpa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It only records in-flight, and the drone makes an audible noise, so it’s clear when footage is recording&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eez7QZ"&gt;The battery life is short, with flight time limited to around five minutes. “The idea is it’s very like tactical; you don’t need to go see that a door’s ajar for two hours,” said Siminoff. “It’s meant to go out for a few minutes, see what you need to see, and then fly back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ReOboC"&gt;A flying camera in your home does feel like a sci-fi fantasy / horror story come true. But from a practical and privacy standpoint, the concept is a solid one. You only need one camera to see an entire floor of your home, and there’s no danger of it accidentally recording without you knowing about it. Also, it’s way cool. “There’s something about watching this fly through your house on your phone; it feels like something out of Hollywood, but it’s your house,” said Siminoff. “For me, it really was a jaw-dropping experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sling TV coming to all existing Echo Show devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h7uGrAgSzPeXXiJIOQ_D6jlGH3U=/83x0:971x592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920787/gvkU6ndVnA.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BpUqc"&gt;During its big hardware and announcement event today, Amazon revealed some exciting news for those of us who prefer linear viewing: Sling TV is coming to all existing Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RGlU6"&gt;Amazon said during the event that the Echo Show will soon have support for live and linear viewing through the Sling TV app. Support will also extend to the new wall-mounted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;, which could change the way users interact with their devices. Support for Sling TV will make the Show work more like a traditional television, particularly in rooms like kitchens where space might be tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGDk3W"&gt;Once the app becomes widely available on Echo Show devices, users will be able to ask Alexa to tune in to their favorite channels. (Sling TV includes on-demand series and movies as well.) To use the app on their Echo Show, users will need to subscribe to one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252810/sling-tv-price-increase-free-dvr-youtube-hulu"&gt;Sling’s live TV packages&lt;/a&gt;, which start at $35 dollars per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGzZP0"&gt;Amazon confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Sling TV will arrive on all Echo Show devices in the US soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Glow is a video chat gadget with built-in games to keep kids engaged</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g4Z1bN5b2sqAbaePZ1g0R6_XS8Q=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920775/amazon_glow_drawing.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mELYCi"&gt;Amazon has never shied away from making strange gadgets that require a bit of explanation, but the new Amazon Glow might take the prize for the strangest in several years. It’s a videoconferencing device that also has a tabletop projector built into it. The idea is that younger children get quickly bored with video chats and wander off, leaving their remote relative staring at an empty screen. So the Amazon Glow can project games, books, or puzzles onto a table that kids and their parents (or grandparents) can play together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XU5HX"&gt;Amazon Glow will cost $299.99 when it’s released widely, but for now, anybody who wants one will need to apply to an invite-only program (and get an introductory price of $249.99). It comes with a year of the Amazon Kids Plus content service, has a two-year warranty against all breaks and spills, and also comes with a set of interactive &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram"&gt;tangram&lt;/a&gt; shapes kids can use to solve puzzles. The first units should ship in mid-October and only in the US to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjhofU"&gt;Setting up the Amazon Glow will probably be the first challenge for parents. It has Amazon’s characteristically good parental controls, so to get the device going, parents will log in and set up a list of trusted people their child can call with it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rkBlxgoPOUYFqr-SlmMnQNvZX_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884083/amazon_glow_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Glow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2OWC71"&gt;But it also has the added challenge of not being the only device they’ll need to set up. On the other end of each call, the parent or grandparent will need to install a custom Amazon Glow app on their tablet — it works with iPads and Android tablets, with Amazon’s own Fire tablets coming soon. It can also work with phones, but it’s not ideal on those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="im7bDq"&gt;So a parent will theoretically need to learn how to set up the Glow, teach their child the basics (Amazon says it’s targeted to children between three and nine), then finally teach their own parents or relatives how the tablet apps work. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dA8Dt5Qf2J2u-vi3F482k7HxVbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884086/amazon_glow_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the tablet user on the other end of a call might see.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eATpo2"&gt;The Glow itself is designed to sit on an indoor table — preferably not too close to a brightly lit window. It has an eight-inch inch screen for video chat, and it projects a second screen down on a flat, 19-inch white mat that comes with the device (and which Amazon promises is relatively easy to clean). A kid can call their relative by tapping a speed dial button on the front-facing screen, and from there, it works like any other video chat app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bSy7m9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 15 is meant to hang on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"},{"title":"Sling TV coming to all existing Echo Show devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698552/amazon-sling-tv-echo-show-devices"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hMOnG8"&gt;But this video chat app has a shared display — what the kid sees projected on the table is mirrored on the remote iPad. That display can be home to several different activities; there are books, games, puzzles, and some basic learning apps. All of it is within Amazon’s Kids Plus ecosystem, and it’s not clear how much the Glow can do once the included one-year subscription expires. (Normally, Kids Plus costs $2.99 a month.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x9-sgArFy7YdVdPaniTpW2zzW3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884088/amazon_glow_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bundled Amazon Kids Plus subscription comes with a variety of books and other apps, projected onto a 19-inch virtual screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VMUvoa"&gt;Some of the interactions seem really neat. Books are animated with cartoon characters from Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dora the Explorer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;, and more. You can solve puzzles together. There are drawing apps, too — the projector can track a child’s hand using infrared sensors so they can tap or draw on the mat. It also has another camera pointed down so a kid can put in a toy and scan it, turning it into a little object they can incorporate into their drawing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYxkEm"&gt;Games include standards like chess, checkers, Go Fish, and memory match, and Amazon says you can scale up and down the difficulty level, which could help it accommodate older and younger kids. You can also replace the pieces in some games: dragons, pirates, or dinosaurs instead of checkers, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84qHAl"&gt;It is possible to just plop your kid down in front of a Glow and let them play with it themselves (including with screentime limits), but we had to explicitly ask Amazon if this was possible several times before they’d cop to it. The intention here really is to only have it be used for more engaging video calls, even though it’s easy to see similarities between the Glow’s games and other tablet-based game / learning systems &lt;a href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/"&gt;like Osmo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3vR3oMVzKqkW6zK2sB0_NEbI4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884087/amazon_glow_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included “Tangram Bits” add-on. Amazon is promising additional ones to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WV9s0i"&gt;Amazon will similarly sell add-on packs for the Glow, and the company uses the included tangrams as an example of what to expect. When a child puts the shapes together to form a shark, for example, it will animate on the projected display and swim around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3d3QM"&gt;The Amazon Glow can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; call tablets right now; it can’t communicate with another Glow. Both the child and the adult on the other end of the call have control over the screen. There’s also a physical privacy shutter switch on the right side: pull it down, and it disables the microphones and covers the video chat camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dNRH9"&gt;Amazon says that it began development on the Glow before the pandemic began, but it sure seems like a gadget designed for the current moment — a time when it’s much harder for families to get together in the same space. Some &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;parents have had difficulty getting our own kids to stay engaged with grandparents in video chats, so we’re curious if they might warm up to what Amazon is offering.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will let you teach Alexa to recognize and respond to sounds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oy_QQTO0GiSdKAP-ziNpCMlvZs4=/99x0:1551x968/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920771/chrome_6FpHFOD0Qj.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jVWbWu"&gt;Today is Amazon’s fall product hardware showcase, and the company’s Alexa voice assistant is learning an intriguing new trick: Amazon says you’ll be able to program Alexa to recognize “custom sounds,” so it could theoretically alert you or trigger smart home actions when it hears something. The company’s experimented with this a lot in the past, saying it’s taught Alexa to detect snoring, and it turned the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883428/amazon-alexa-guard-alarm-ring-smart-home-security-price"&gt;detect breaking glass and smoke alarm sirens&lt;/a&gt; into its Alexa Guard feature in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18618098/alexa-guard-amazon-echo-speaker-security-feature"&gt;and 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzx15u"&gt;Theoretically, you could soon program Alexa to do far more, but the company isn’t providing a lot of details today. Amazon announced the feature alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"&gt;its sizable new Echo Show 15 smart display&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a custom AZ2 Neural Edge chip to do some of its processing, but it’s not clear if Echo devices will need that new chip to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9IAqc"&gt;Amazon also announced that the AZ2 will help the Echo Show 15 use computer vision to identify different users — which it’s calling “Visual ID” — and do more speech processing on device. Amazon also threw around the phrase “Teachable AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSVGEw"&gt;We’ll let you know when we have more details.&lt;/p&gt;
