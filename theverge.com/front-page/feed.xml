    <title>The autonomous vehicle world is shrinking — it’s overdue</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="30PAVY"&gt;After years of positive vibes about the future of autonomous vehicles and nearly unrestricted access to cash from Kool-Aid-drunk venture capitalists, the AV industry is confronting some hard truths. The first is that autonomous vehicles are going to take a lot longer to reach mass scale than previously thought. The second is that it’s going to be a lot more expensive, too. And the third hard truth: going it alone is no longer a viable option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGpFNZ"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;Lyft sold its self-driving car division to a subsidiary of Toyota&lt;/a&gt; for $550 million. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331794/cruise-acquires-voyage-self-driving-car-merger"&gt;Cruise bought Voyage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;Aurora merged with Uber’s autonomous vehicle unit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-acquires-autonomous-trucking-startup-ike/"&gt;Delivery robot startup Nuro acquired self-driving truck outfit Ike&lt;/a&gt;. There have been so many mergers, joint ventures, and various tie-ups lately it can be difficult to keep them all straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jdlfYW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It can be difficult to keep them all straight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vnWQC"&gt;Where that leaves things is a little unclear. There is still money flowing to these companies, and nearly all of the executives, engineers, and software developers working on the technology remain bullish about the future. But there is a growing sense among experts and investors that the heady days when anyone with a couple of test vehicles, some LIDAR, and a vision for the future could launch a startup are at an end. And there will definitely be more shrinkage to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETwHio"&gt;“The consolidation is long overdue,” said &lt;a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/"&gt;Raj Rajkumar&lt;/a&gt;, robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “The AV industry has promised too much for too long, and has delivered too little.”   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QynkTW"&gt;There are other signs of general unease in the AV world. Last month, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. Krafcik oversaw the transformation of Google’s self-driving car division from “Project Chauffeur” to its own standalone company. During his time, Waymo struck partnerships with several automakers, launched a limited ride-hailing pilot with fully driverless vehicles in Arizona, and expanded its commercial ambitions to include trucking and last-mile delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB9dP6"&gt;As a former auto executive with years of experience at Hyundai and Ford, Krafcik was seen as someone who could bring self-driving cars to the mainstream. But his decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead for self-driving cars — especially as many of those early predictions have failed to come to pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3mGhGQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Krafcik’s decision to step aside at a time of heightened uncertainty highlights the difficult road ahead&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHGm9p"&gt;Krafcik was not able to bring to market an autonomous vehicle that can drive on any road and in any conditions without years of rigorous testing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;Aside from a small area outside Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, Waymo’s cars require backup drivers to monitor the vehicle’s operations and take control if anything goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjlTTe"&gt;Waymo still has a commanding lead in autonomous vehicles, but diminished expectations about the future of self-driving cars are affecting its business in other ways, too. In 2018, Morgan Stanley published a research note &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/29/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-unit-morgan-stanley-forecast-to-highs.html"&gt;valuing the company at $175 billion&lt;/a&gt; based on its perceived leadership in the space and the potential for massive amounts of revenue from its autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHRytl"&gt;A year later, the bank slashed Waymo’s valuation to $105 billion, still an extraordinary amount of money for a company with no revenue. But last year, when Waymo announced its first external funding round of $2.25 billion, the company declined to discuss what valuation that investment was based on. Later, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed8dc4ca-5eaf-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; it to be $30 billion — a nearly 85 percent decrease from 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3w20R"&gt;Valuations aren’t the sole indicator of where things stand with autonomous vehicles. But they do point to investor sentiment. And right now, investors are not feeling as confident in the prediction that autonomous vehicles will soon become the dominant form of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnwAE1Ee3kIxKoL1SoQ-oUd23l0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10793777/Van_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Drive.ai&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq6Ud7"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/faculty/missy-cummings"&gt;Missy Cummings&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, has been criticizing rosy predictions about our driverless future. She’s consistently warned that the technology is much further away and harder to get right than anyone in the industry cares to admit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoCPjO"&gt;The recent trend in consolidation is vindication for her position, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG8EQ1"&gt;“It’s kind of like the elephant in the room,” she said of the shrinking of the AV world. “People will mention that and then they’ll stop themselves from making the Socratic connection to what this means about the viability of this industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jl1Ncp"&gt;But Cummings doesn’t think people in the industry will be able to ignore the truth for much longer. “There is an embarrassingly large sum of money that’s been invested in this, so people feel like they have to keep going down that path because surely all these people who invested all this money can’t be wrong,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J1W5IR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not everyone is delusional. Just most people in this business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgF1Iy"&gt;“Not everyone is delusional,” she added. “Just most people in this business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zigYR"&gt;That said, Toyota and Aurora weren’t delusional when they decided to buy the automated driving teams at Lyft and Uber, respectively. They likely saw the value in the code produced by those teams, as well as the talent accrued by the ride-hailing companies over the years. When you can’t hire the people you’d like to staff your own projects, then you have to acquihire them, the distinctive Silicon Valley practice of buying a smaller company for the express purpose of acquiring their team of software engineers. Also, Uber and Lyft were very motivated to sell as recently public companies under pressure to staunch the bleeding and become profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQsbWp"&gt;Another recent acquihire was when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;Apple bought bankrupt self-driving startup Drive.ai &lt;/a&gt;back in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/apple-lays-off-over-200-from-project-titan-autonomous-vehicle-group.html"&gt;Apple had just laid off over 200 engineers&lt;/a&gt; from its secretive Project Titan, its own floundering self-driving operation. The Drive.ai team, composed of several graduates from Stanford’s AI lab, had already had some modest success with a ride-hailing pilot in Texas. Unhappy with its own team, Apple simply fired them and bought a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0o4gx"&gt;“The buying up of these companies represents companies being able to buy skill sets that they would not otherwise be able to recruit,” Cummings said. “And I think that’s very valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1FJYC_GL1czsvFjH11BfMhrcnHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13601830/vpavic_181128_3122_0115.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bTJCt2"&gt;The recent reorganization of the self-driving car industry may also point to a new set of priorities. Namely, robotaxis are out, and logistics and industrial applications are in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqBxk0"&gt;Four years ago, the industry saw plenty of startups come out of stealth promising to do everything: they were going to make hardware &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;software; they were going to build their own vehicle; they were going to do robotaxis &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;delivery &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;trucking. And of course, they were going to change the world in the process. “It was a little bit like the decathlete business model,” said &lt;a href="https://reillybrennan.com/"&gt;Reilly Brennan&lt;/a&gt;, general partner at venture capital firm &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.vc/"&gt;Trucks&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re going to be very good at 10 different things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHHcnn"&gt;Now, most investors are interested in more “structured” applications of automated driving technology, such as construction, mining, middle-mile delivery, and agriculture. “So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wkNGZ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“So instead of being a decathlete, you had to pick a javelin thrower”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WzrNJI"&gt;That’s not to say robotaxis are completely dead — far from it, with major players like Waymo, Cruise, Argo, and Baidu as well as smaller startups like Pony.ai, May Mobility, and Optimus Ride still banking on the proliferation of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles by the middle of this decade. But Brennan says the robotaxi craze has definitely cooled in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6595S6"&gt;“Frankly, we stopped seeing robotaxi startups in probably the end of 2017,” Brennan said. “Here we are in 2021 and there are very few ongoing robotaxi startups that aren’t, you know, Cruise, Waymo, or Argo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQSpoD"&gt;Brennan thinks the concept of autonomous vehicles that can drive anywhere under any conditions is still possible, but much further out than originally thought. They will require huge financial investments — “11 figures” by Brennan’s estimates — and a willingness to tolerate zero cash flow until the technology is mature and safe enough to launch. There are only so many companies with deep enough pockets to take on that challenge: major car companies like Ford, GM, and Volkswagen or tech giants like Apple, Alphabet, and Intel. Everyone else is probably not long for this world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SszjqN"&gt;The mid-level engineers always knew this to be true, Brennan said. It was the CEOs who were making the erroneous predictions about the availability of self-driving taxis by 2020. “I think the CEOs of those companies knew that they were going to be playing golf by 2020,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV is $100 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dVFQ7U3cl5-9QxO4rlza7QaAaU=/68x0:1898x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69251237/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_11.42.52_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G7qhUk"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV has received a price cut during Best Buy’s sale event that will last through the weekend. Normally $1,300, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739879816744555003#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $1,200&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the most affordable methods of getting an OLED. This model made its way into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our roundup of the best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to its HDMI 2.1 ports that allow for 4K resolution at 120Hz. In other words, it can show up to 120 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPAU1m"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch thinks this is a good option if you want to save money compared to an LG OLED but still want the best possible picture quality and generous viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XAItDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NnpQHn"&gt;Also at Best Buy, Apple’s new HomePod mini includes a Wemo smart Wi-Fi plug for $110. The speaker alone usually costs $100, and Best Buy reduced the cost of the plug by $15. If you’ve had your eye on the newer, smaller HomePod, you might as well go for this bundle to maximize your savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zOTZxQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10487884"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rTBhdI"&gt;While we’re on the topic of Apple products, its AirPods Pro are still $190 at Woot, which is the lowest price currently available. The discount isn’t tremendous or the best-ever price (the competition is offering them for just $10 more), but it’s nice to save whether you’re buying them as a gift or for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8o8GTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ATBSOO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pe8tG2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LiveLeak, the internet’s font of gore and violence, has shut down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPGITICrqoWSnoREK099Ws4hvyc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250956/acastro_200915_1777_hacking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vYX0TS"&gt;Video site LiveLeak, best known for hosting gruesome footage that mainstream rivals wouldn’t touch, has &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/ll"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; after fifteen years in operation. In its place is “ItemFix,” a site that &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/faq"&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; users from uploading media containing “excessive violence or gory content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y0JhE"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/ll"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, LiveLeak founder Hayden Hewitt did not give an explicit reason for the site’s closure, saying only that: “The world has changed a lot over these last few years, the Internet alongside it, and we as people.” In a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/b7iNvp82OTo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on his YouTube channel Trigger Warning, Hewitt offered no further details, but said that maintaining LiveLeak had become a struggle, and that he and his team “just didn’t have it in us to carry on fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG42SS"&gt;“Everything’s different now, everything moves on,” says Hewitt, before adding in an aside to the camera: “I don’t fucking like it. I liked it much better when it was the Wild West.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pkYmI7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LiveLeak grew out of the “shock sites” of the early internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5LwNE"&gt;LiveLeak has been a mainstay of internet culture for many years, its name synonymous with footage of murder, terrorism, and everyday incidents of crime and violence. A sinister doppelgänger to sites like YouTube, LiveLeak was founded in 2006 and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316104436/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/profile-of-hayden-hewitt-founder-of-liveleak-2014-10"&gt;grew out of a culture &lt;/a&gt;of early internet “shock sites” like Ogrish, &lt;a href="http://Rotten.com"&gt;Rotten.com&lt;/a&gt;, and BestGore: websites that hosted violent and pornographic content with the express aim of disgusting visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBS4q5"&gt;LiveLeak, with its tagline of “Redefining the Media,” ostensibly added some nuance to this brutish appeal. Official statements from those involved sometimes defended its content in terms of newsworthiness or truth-telling. When the site attracted controversy in the UK for hosting footage of children fighting, for example, Hewitt defended sharing the videos as a form of bearing witness.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;We have to take a stance of saying ‘look all this is happening, this is real life, this is going on, we’re going to show it,’” he told &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6920817.stm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3oEHq"&gt;Despite this, the site often changed its policies concerning controversial footage. In 2014 it attracted significant attention (and traffic) for hosting a video of the beheading of US journalist James Foley by terror group ISIS. But soon after the site’s owners &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111225012/https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a69_1408615973"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would host no future beheading videos created by ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGGMQU"&gt;“We’ve shown the world the true horror of this form of execution more than once in the past and we cannot find any compelling reason to even be thought of as promoting the actions of this group,” said a blog post. “We know they [ISIS] do not find support here on LL and that condemnation is virtually universal but there is no reason at all to show more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJUIC4"&gt;Similarly, the site chose not to host videos of the 2019 Christchurch shootings, stating in another &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hnKeuRG4z8YJ:https://www.liveleak.com/view%3Ft%3DuSQT_1552831454+&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that LiveLeak never had a “show everything” policy, and that hosting the video would only give the shooter what he wanted: more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aboy7j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LiveLeak attracted sizable traffic, proof of the enduring appeal of its shocking content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVX7qt"&gt;Although the site’s content likely stopped it from reaching the prominence of other video hosts, it still attracted sizable numbers of viewers. A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/style/really-bad-stuff.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that web tracking firm Alexa ranked it as the 695th most popular website in the world, putting it roughly on a par with mainstream sites like &lt;em&gt;The Onion &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Jezebel&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaBF1T"&gt;The same report cites an academic &lt;a href="https://people.southwestern.edu/~bednarb/capstone/capstone_materials/payton_reading.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Sue Tait that attempts to explain the enduring popularity of such violent and gory content. Based on her observations of the Ogrish forums, Tait categorized four different “spectatorial positions.” There is the “amoral gaze,” where the content is stimulating and pleasurable; the “vulnerable gaze” where the imagery is experienced as harmful; the “entitled gaze,” where viewers justify their actions as seeing past the “censorship” of mainstream outlets; and the “responsive gaze,” where looking is framed as a way for the viewer to prepare for coming hardships, like a career in the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IEGu5"&gt;The range of justifications identified by Tait and other academics suggest that demand for such extreme content will always exist, even if individual sites like LiveLeak come and go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0HCSJ"&gt;In his farewell blog post, the site’s founder Hayden Hewitt emphasized the importance of the site’s community. “To the members, the uploaders, the casual visitors, the trolls and the occasionally demented people who have been with us. You have been our constant companions and although we probably didn’t get to communicate too often you’re appreciated more than you realize,” he writes. “On a personal level you have fascinated and amused me with your content. Lastly, to those no longer with us. I still remember you.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC report blasts manufacturers for restricting product repairs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STLdVDwAAMcAN305IgVlBOTlR98=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250741/apple_repair_service_expansion_iphone_repair_07072020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4Mi4o"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/05/ftc-report-congress-examines-anti-competitive-repair-restrictions"&gt;published its long-awaited report&lt;/a&gt; on how manufacturers limit product repairs. The &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf"&gt;“Nixing the Fix” report&lt;/a&gt; details a host of repair restrictions, especially those imposed by mobile phone and car manufacturers. The anticompetitive practices covered by the FTC range from limited availability of spare parts and diagnostic software to designs that make repairs more difficult than they need to be. In response, the FTC wants to develop new laws and rules surrounding repairs, but it also wants better enforcement of existing legislation like the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfRirC"&gt;While debates around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719701/european-parliament-right-to-repair-resolution-hardware-eu-commission-2021"&gt;right to repair rules in the EU&lt;/a&gt; have tended to focus on the environmental impact of sending broken devices to landfills, the FTC’s report leads with the impacts they have on people. It says repair restrictions are bad for consumers when they can’t easily repair their devices, and adds that these “may place a greater financial burden on communities of color and lower-income Americans.” Independent repair shops also suffer as a result of repair restrictions, “disproportionately [affecting] small businesses owned by people of color.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRPHOd"&gt;The timing of the report is also important. Not only has it arrived during an unprecedented period of working from home and remote learning, where teleworking equipment is more important than ever, but it also coincides with a global semiconductor shortage that’s made buying new equipment particularly difficult. Combined, they make it particularly important to be able to repair our existing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYTYKl"&gt;According to the FTC, manufacturers are guilty of using numerous tactics that make it difficult for customers and independent businesses to repair their products. Here’s the full list from the FTC’s report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2axQtK"&gt;Product designs that complicate or prevent repair;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ckz8W1"&gt;Unavailability of parts and repair information;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKIyh2"&gt;Designs that make independent repairs less safe;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzOvyB"&gt;Policies or statements that steer consumers to manufacturer repair networks;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoIGYg"&gt;Application of patent rights and enforcement of trademarks;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks3br4"&gt;Disparagement of non-OEM parts and independent repair;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a7q89"&gt;Software locks and firmware updates; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wu9KKy"&gt;End User License Agreements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LdeBZZ"&gt;Manufacturers have long argued that they have legitimate reasons for at least some of these restrictions. These include protecting their intellectual property, cybersecurity, and possible safety risks associated with independent repairers opening up our devices and replacing failed parts. But the FTC isn’t buying it. “There is scant evidence to support manufacturers’ justifications for repair restrictions,” the report states, adding that “the majority” of manufacturers’ explanations for repair restrictions “are not supported by the record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfAwbs"&gt;Apple, one of the companies most frequently criticized for its repair policies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357187/apple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries"&gt;has made moves&lt;/a&gt; to make spare parts and diagnostic tools more available to independent repair shops in recent years. But &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows"&gt;critics say&lt;/a&gt; the new policies still give the company too much power over independent businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erY1ot"&gt;The CEO of repair specialists iFixit &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F50251%2Fftc-report-congress-nixing-fix-repair-restrictions-reactions&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424363%2Fftc-repair-restrictions-report-nixing-the-fix-smartphones-automakers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;welcomed the FTC’s report&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a great step in the right direction,” said Kyle Wiens. “The bi-partisan report shows that FTC knows that the market has not regulated itself, and is committing to real action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4632vN"&gt;With the findings submitted to Congress, the question now is how to make repairing devices easier. The FTC’s report makes several suggestions, including the introduction of new legislation to address repair restrictions and open repair markets. While it also encourages manufacturers to self-regulate, the FTC concedes that the broad range of industries and products involved would make that a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agyY7y"&gt;The FTC suggests consumers could be given more information on how repairable devices are, such as with repairability scores like those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302664/apple-france-repairability-scores-index-law-right-to-repair"&gt;recently introduced in France&lt;/a&gt;. But the FTC also wants consumers to report when manufacturers aren’t obeying existing rules surrounding repairs, as described in an &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/ftc-weighs-repair-restrictions"&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TasIEE"&gt;Let’s say you took a product to an independent repair shop to fix or maintain it. Then later you go to the product’s manufacturer for a repair — but one not related to the earlier fix. If that repair is covered by your warranty, and if your warranty hasn’t expired, the manufacturer can’t refuse to make the repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhkxzb"&gt;If you’re told that your warranty was voided or that it will be voided because of independent repair, we want to hear about it. Report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P5clzb"&gt;The FTC’s report follows efforts by several US states, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719701/european-parliament-right-to-repair-resolution-hardware-eu-commission-2021"&gt;European Parliament vote last year&lt;/a&gt;, to expand right to repair rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sennheiser’s headphone business has been bought by hearing aid manufacturer Sonova</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="sennheiser hd 800 s" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/huoegl7CXkptC4XuEU0qyTQ4Nd4=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250731/sennheiser_hd_800_s.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pair of Sennheiser HD 800 S headphones. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZZolL1"&gt;Sonova, a Swiss company best known for its medical audio products like hearing aids and cochlear implants, is &lt;a href="https://www.sonova.com/en/expanding-our-offering-and-entering-new-growth-markets-sonova-acquire-sennheiser-consumer-division"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt; the consumer electronics division of German firm Sennheiser. That means Sonova is taking over Sennheiser’s portfolio of consumer headphones, wireless earbuds, and soundbars, moving into an expanding market for personal audio equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOdZ6V"&gt;Sennheiser announced it was looking for a buyer for its consumer business in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285497/sennheiser-investors-selling-consumer-headphones-soundbars-business"&gt;mid-February&lt;/a&gt; “amid strong competitive pressure.” Although the company’s consumer products hit record sales in 2019, the firm still lost money with profit margins “under pressure” from global rivals. It cut 650 jobs and said “all options are open” to help the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPeBiw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sennheiser’s brand (and products) will live on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nB4I2X"&gt;Now the company has found a buyer in Sonova. In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fmessage-from-andreas-and-daniel-sennheiser-otoics&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424367%2Fsonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; by Sennheiser’s co-CEOs, brothers Andreas and Daniel Sennheiser, the pair said they “couldn’t have asked for [a] better” partner. “A partner who not only shares our passion for audio and a commitment to the highest product quality, but also very similar corporate values,” they write. “This is an excellent foundation for a successful future together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlURCi"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fsonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-wpc768&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424367%2Fsonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the deal from Sonova, the company said it will continue to sell products under the Sennheiser brand. “Combining our audiological expertise with Sennheiser’s know-how in sound delivery, their great reputation as well as their high-quality products will allow us to expand our offering and to create important touchpoints with consumers earlier in their hearing journey,” said Sonova CEO Arnd Kaldowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwEHAA"&gt;Sonova said the purchase price of the division amounts to €200 million ($241 million), and that Sennheiser’s business generates revenues of €250 million annually. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval, but Sonova says it expects to close it in “the second half of calendar year 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRs8f3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic needs to tarnish Apple’s App Store halo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_dbuH7j00UhHKuAGNbEG0UMwpE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249704/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3Yc8Y"&gt;At the beginning of this week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple described Epic’s lawsuit as an “assault” on the entire iOS philosophy. One of the iPhone and iPad’s defining features is a curated ecosystem (or, from a different perspective, a walled garden). A loss for Apple could require it to allow side-loaded apps and alternative app stores, potentially including Epic’s own Epic Games Store. Apple says that would damage the privacy and security that iOS is known for, making Apple spend more money to fix new problems that crop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qes3P"&gt;Epic spent the fourth day of trial offering its counter-narrative: the iOS App Store isn’t actually very good. Calling two Apple executives to the stand, Epic’s attorneys took jabs at everything from the update review process to Apple allegedly leaking Marshmello’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert playlist. They pushed Apple to justify its claims about privacy and security by producing hard research demonstrating threats and breaches — which Apple largely didn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAdN3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic is making the case that the app store just isn’t very good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOrmnw"&gt;After a short examination of Epic’s online business strategy head Thomas Ko, Epic called on Matt Fischer, App Store vice president and the first witness employee from Apple. Epic’s attorney peppered Fischer with anecdotes from frustrated developers — calling the iOS in-app payment system a “joke,” the refund policies “awful,” the review process “arbitrary and unpredictable,” and the entire store “plagued with outdated, low-quality apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spju9Q"&gt;Apple’s App Store has some clear problems. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister wrote last month&lt;/a&gt;, you can find ridiculous stories about iOS apps that appear to swindle users yet maintain unbelievably high review stories — and aren’t removed even months after a formal complaint. Eric Friedman, an Apple employee who is set to testify, has been quoted saying the app review team is “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog” or “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qssmJ"&gt;But Epic’s questioning today didn’t capture the kind of drama that implies. The attorneys spent much of their time trying to catch Apple executives in contradictions, and while they quoted disgruntled developers like the ones above, they rarely delved into the substance of their complaints. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers became audibly irritated with Epic repeatedly producing documents to establish a “state of mind” about the App Store rather than hard facts, since the files would be uploaded for public viewing. “Non-lawyers don’t understand the difference between something being admitted for its truth and being admitted for some other evidentiary purpose,” she told an attorney. Apple countered one negative review snippet simply by having Fischer read the line above it, where the writer said they were still giving the App Store a high rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzD79T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6Fko"&gt;There’s one plausible reason Epic doesn’t have more specific stories: many developers are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html"&gt;reportedly scared to criticize Apple&lt;/a&gt;. That’s been a running theme in congressional scrutiny of Apple, and Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store — even if developers try to return via Apple’s Safari browser, they’ll be denied access to things like push notifications and AR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiaM2i"&gt;Epic also still has witnesses who could poke holes in Apple’s narrative. Friedman is scheduled to appear over the next two weeks, and so is an executive from Match Group, which spoke critically of Apple in front of Congress. Epic’s attorneys left a big question hanging about whether Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/"&gt;offers special terms to some developers&lt;/a&gt; — something Fischer denied, but wasn’t heavily pressed on. In any case, this trial hinges on much more than the precise quality of Apple’s developer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP4keM"&gt;But today demonstrates the difficulty of discussing large-scale moderation without opening yourself up to charges of dealing in mere anecdotes. Judge Rogers made clear that she’s interested in whether Apple is better or worse than its alternatives, not simply whether it’s ever had problems. And while Epic can point to individual screwups, Apple will try to argue that it’s doing its best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvs9pg"&gt;“It’s a human process. We do make mistakes,” said Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, the day’s last witness. “But we certainly try to rectify those mistakes when we learn of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Don’t drive while you are on a Zoom meeting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Man at steering wheel checking messages on smart phone while driving car on road." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dC-BMpjgSuxNumo3e0Wy0J1Nytc=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249448/923335020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s better not to be distracted while driving | Photo by: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VyYANj"&gt;Who among us has not tried during the pandemic to conceal the background of our home offices during a Zoom call for work— lest we reveal a messy bedroom, or get ragged on by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom"&gt;RoomRater&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDnJdr"&gt;For Republican state Sen. Andrew Brenner of Ohio, the green screen betrayed him during a video call this week, making it clear he was driving a car even though his background image &lt;a href="http://ohiochannel.org/video/ohio-controlling-board-5-3-2021"&gt;showed what looked like a home office&lt;/a&gt;. That wouldn’t have been a big deal except it was the same day that Ohio’s legislature was considering a bill that would have toughened the state’s rules on driving while using an electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKgpfz"&gt;One could argue that a video call might be a significant distraction while driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NSA6o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/05/03/ohio-state-sen-andrew-brenner-attended-government-meeting-via-video-while-driving/4929012001/"&gt;Brenner told the &lt;em&gt;Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he was parked for most of the video call, was not distracted, and was listening to the meeting. He also noted he was wearing his seat belt and paying attention to the road while he was driving. But as &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/politicians-zoom-background-cant-hide-fact-that-hes-act-1846835103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the video Brenner turns his camera on and off, and continually adjusts the background as if he’s not happy with how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mjifQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA134-HB-283"&gt;Ohio House Bill 283&lt;/a&gt; would enhance the state law on distracted driving, “to a general prohibition against using an electronic wireless communications devices.” Hands-free and voice-operated devices would be allowed, and there’s an exception for emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqaCkE"&gt;At the very least, Brenner adhered to&lt;a href="https://publicsafety.ohio.gov/static/HSY7742.pdf"&gt; Ohio’s seat belt law&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe for the next meeting he should keep it in park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXUDrA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: An earlier version of this story stated that the Zoom meeting Brenner attended was where the distracted driving bill was discussed. In fact, the bill was being discussed the same day in the Ohio legislature. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FMbrl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ThpsP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihUjqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LEss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvVrKy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tJ7Ec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4u7qE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A61wE3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing a new Tip Jar feature for sending money to your favorite accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajljYICFX84AjiO6tkC0zcvnAvA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248373/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1g4b2"&gt;Twitter has started &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tip-jar.html"&gt;rolling out a new Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; on its Android and iOS apps, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;as rumored&lt;/a&gt;) will allow users to send money directly to their favorite accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WVUWS"&gt;To use the tip jar, simply tap on the freshly added dollar bill icon next to someone’s username when viewing their profile on one of Twitter’s mobile apps. Users will be able to toggle the tip jar feature, too (for those individuals or organizations that don’t want people just sending them cash out of the blue). Android users will also be able to send money in Twitter’s Clubhouse-like Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uWH8v"&gt;Tip Jar supports a variety of payment options and links: Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo. Twitter is using those services’ external payment processors for transactions; it doesn’t take a cut. All English language Twitter users can send tips starting today, but only a select group (including “creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits”) can turn on the feature to accept money for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3xme8z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;show your love, leave a tip &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now testing Tip Jar, a new way to give and receive money on Twitter   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;more coming soon... &lt;a href="https://t.co/7vyCzlRIFc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7vyCzlRIFc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1390396166496522247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cY25Va"&gt;Users have been using Twitter to solicit tips or Patreon follows for years — ending viral threads with a shoutout to a SoundCloud account is practically a meme at this point. So it makes sense that Twitter would be looking to streamline the feature as part of its own app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMinK6"&gt;Notably, the only way to access Tip Jar right now is through navigating to a user’s profile. That means sending someone some money for a truly fantastic tweet will still take a bit more effort than, say, just liking or retweeting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13beBE"&gt;There are already some issues that Twitter will have to work out. As spotted by Rachel Tobac, sending tips through Paypal using Tip Jar currently allows whoever is sending the money to see the recipient’s address, which is a worrying security issue that Twitter and Paypal will hopefully resolve soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p02t7P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Huge heads up on PayPal Twitter Tip Jar. If you send a person a tip using PayPal, when the receiver opens up the receipt from the tip you sent, they get your *address*. Just tested to confirm by tipping &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yashar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@yashar&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter w/ PayPal and he did in fact get my address I tipped him. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ"&gt;https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/r8UyJpNCxu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/r8UyJpNCxu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rachel Tobac (@RachelTobac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1390409874006183936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gRtp1"&gt;In an update later Thursday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1390451333602422787?s=20"&gt;Twitter’s Support account&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the issue, tweeting that it was “updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpclYz"&gt;Twitter also promised there was “more coming soon,” so it’s likely that we’ll continue to hear more about how Twitter is implementing tipping in the coming weeks and months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aetg0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 5:30pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information on Paypal address security issues using Tip Jar. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9OrdM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th 8:27PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional detail from Twitter about shared information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is giving a laser company that builds some of its AR tech $410 million</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C0IJlY"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-an-additional-410-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund-to-ii-vi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F6%2F22423827%2Fapple-ii-vi-advanced-manufacturing-fund-award-ar-vr-faceid" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s awarding Pennsylvania-based optical technology company II-VI with $410 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple CEO  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1390378601690791938"&gt;Tim Cook tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s tech helps power Apple’s FaceID, Memoji, and Portrait Mode. The company also manufactures lasers that are used in the LIDAR scanner found in the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro, technology that Apple touts as being key to augmented reality experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGxtFF"&gt;Finisar, which was &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/09/finisar-acquisition-iivi-aapl-fnsr.html"&gt;later acquired by II-VI&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “two-six”) r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771246/apple-finisar-iphone-laser-investment"&gt;eceived $390 million&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s fund back in 2017. While this latest investment likely shows that Apple intends to keep FaceID (which is powered by II-VI’s vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers) around for a while, it could also be another sign pointing to Apple’s future with AR and VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3seH3"&gt;Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;has publicly said&lt;/a&gt; that he believes AR is “critically important” to Apple’s future, and II-VI manufactures devices that help computers see the world in 3D. The money could help develop more advanced version of the technology already found on Apple devices, potentially for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;the rumored mixed reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. II-VI’s CEO says in Apple’s press release that the partnership with Apple “sets the stage for a new wave of breakthrough technologies that we believe will enable a wide range of applications that will benefit our world for decades to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuvtMT"&gt;The press release states that II-VI will use the funds to expand manufacturing capacity, create jobs, and “accelerate delivery of future components for iPhone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAHqVj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article had II-VI written as II-IV throughout. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton says it ‘could take months’ to bring treadmill back after recall</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aWCTpt"&gt;Peloton expects it to be a number of months before either of its treadmills are offered for sale again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;after a recall was issued&lt;/a&gt; on both models yesterday. One of the models posed the risk of “injury or death,” Peloton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4mY00"&gt;The more expensive Tread Plus treadmill, which has been on sale since 2018, “could take months” to return to market, said Peloton CEO John Foley on a call with investors this afternoon. Peloton needs to develop a hardware solution to prevent people, animals, and objects from getting sucked underneath the machine and then get that solution approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). A six-year-old child died recently after being pulled underneath a Tread Plus, the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdiQF5"&gt;The cheaper machine, the Tread, could be up for sale again as soon as July, Foley said. He said the timeline for a fix to be approved could be six to eight weeks. Fixing the Tread will be simpler, he said, since it largely involves making a change to screws and washers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Dsi9C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We expect them to be the best products by far in the market and the safest products.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naNm7U"&gt;Peloton recalled both treadmill models yesterday due to concerns they could injure owners or others near them. The Tread Plus had the most serious problems, with more than 70 recorded incidents of adults, children, pets, or objects being pulled under the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuzOhd"&gt;The issues were less severe for the lower-cost Tread model. The CPSC said there were 18 incidents of the Tread’s touchscreen falling and causing minor cuts and bruises in the UK and Canada, where it’s primarily for sale. That model has only been sold in limited numbers in the US, but it was supposed to go on sale widely starting May 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NwT0c"&gt;Foley told investors the company’s treadmills would return with safety in mind, saying the company needed to be a “leader in safety in the industry.” He said the company’s repaired products would be “one of the safest if not the safest treadmills in the world” and that “when we bring them back to the market, we expect them to be the best products by far in the market and the safest products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQa9y5"&gt;Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388707/peloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death"&gt;initially resisted&lt;/a&gt; the CPSC’s urge for a recall. In a note yesterday, Foley said that was a mistake. “We should have engaged more productively with [the CPSC] from the outset,” Foley wrote. “For that, I apologize.”&lt;/p&gt;
