    <title>macOS Monterey will have the old Safari tab design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhyLDb8c8-RUeh8c_o_ttrFgDXY=/34x0:645x407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70013016/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_1.04.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you squint, you can see the old tab design.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9bpgJe"&gt;Apple debuted a controversial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;new Safari tab design&lt;/a&gt; this summer at WWDC 2021, and since then, it has tweaked that look and even let you turn off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686070/apple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back"&gt;many of the changes&lt;/a&gt;. With macOS Monterey, however, the company is going back to the way tabs looked before. On Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/"&gt;official page&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming software update, if you scroll down to the section titled “Access Tab Groups anywhere,” you can just barely see Safari’s older (and arguably better) design in the example screenshots on both a Mac &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; on an iPad (&lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/18/safari-15-tabs"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ln4bay"&gt;Perhaps even more surprising is that the old design is now the default, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macos-monterey-reverts-safari-changes/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which observed the reverted tabs in the macOS Monterey release candidate. However, if you want to use the design Apple revealed at WWDC, where tabs also function as URL bars, that will be an option you can flip on in the preferences menu, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cArQQv"&gt;macOS Monterey will be available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22725047/macos-monterey-release-date-compatibility-features-m1-pro-max-chip"&gt;on October 25th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A piece of cloth to clean your Apple devices will cost you $19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MaBouiod9dMXVHalGo2dUU0FT34=/167x0:1033x577/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012992/polishing_cloth_apple_1200.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IF3LeX"&gt;If you were ever concerned about safely cleaning your Apple products, now you can use an official $19 piece of cloth made by Apple to do so. Apple released this polishing cloth after today’s event in addition to its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;Pros&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;M1 Pro and Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/18/apple-introduces-new-polishing-cloth-for-all-devices-sold-separately-for-19/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A folded Apple polishing cloth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0jsL6Xm15HYes7DTG4K5T20H5xY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22937127/folded_polishing_cloth.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v7g6ew"&gt;The Apple-branded cloth, made of unspecified nonabrasive materials, will be available to purchase separately. Other than having an Apple logo stamped on it, it’s unclear how the cloth is any different from a typical microfiber cloth that you can get for a fraction of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhJ7FC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172"&gt;Apple recommends&lt;/a&gt; using “soft, lint-free cloth” and avoiding “abrasive cloths, towels, paper towels, or similar items” when cleaning your Apple devices, which are all worries that this $19 cloth puts to rest. On &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth"&gt;the cloth’s product page&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says it can clean the displays — and nano-texture glass — on any Apple device. Yes, there is a compatibility list if you’re wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1COVwH"&gt;It’s reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21009928/apples-pro-display-xdr-nano-texture-cloth-clean"&gt;polishing cloth that’s required to clean the pricey nano-texture Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt;. Did we mention that the cloth actually comes free with the Pro Display XDR? Apparently, $6,000 is the price you’ll have to pay if you want a single piece of cloth included with your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will support Twitch co-streaming for the first episode of Arcane</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQWnuNCVK4atxyCUuZn3YIGeID4=/366x0:1682x877/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012947/Jinx_Close.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OY6j4k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, Riot’s upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688837/netflix-arcane-league-of-legends-trailer-show-riot-games-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-adapted fantasy series debuting on Netflix next month, will become Netflix’s first show to premiere with co-streaming on Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKKset"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; will premiere on Netflix globally on Saturday, November 6th. The partnership with Twitch will allow communities to stream &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;’s first episode with community members and allow Twitch streamers to share their reactions in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILj9th"&gt;A spokesperson for Riot tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that anyone can stream the first episode of &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; on Twitch — no pre-approval required. The series premiere will coincide with a Global Premiere Event at Riot’s Los Angeles headquarters. The company says in a press release that the event will be streamed by influencers representing over 30 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rDyHtX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ps6nV4wiCE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="756qhz"&gt;“Interest in deeper storytelling from our global player base played a big part in our decision to make &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s only right that they will be able to watch the first episode of &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; together as a community,” Brandon Miao, cross-product experiences and partnerships lead, Riot Experience (XP), said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7R2p84"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is Riot’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;first TV series&lt;/a&gt; and will debut in three acts, each &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arcaneshow/status/1441832373549613062"&gt;comprising three episodes&lt;/a&gt;, on Netflix globally and Tencent Video in China. Act 1 of the series will debut on November 6th, while Acts 2 and 3 will debut on November 13th and November 20th, respectively. The show will be nine episodes long in total.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want a fully specced-out MacBook Pro? You’ll have to pay more than $6,000</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ZV-dqnBXxYdyqiLBcVq0aU8rlA=/307x0:1960x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012917/Apple_MacBook_Pro_Photo_Edit_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s most expensive laptop is, well, expensive.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2exT92"&gt;Apple announced new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;M1-equipped MacBook Pros on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, and they look like very good upgrades, with powerful chips, adaptive refresh rate displays, the return of some beloved ports, and more. They don’t come cheap, though, with the 14-inch MBP starting at $1,999 and the 16-inch one starting at $2,499. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxTvUt"&gt;And if you want to buy the absolute highest-end model, with 64GB of unified memory, 8GB of SSD storage, a 140W USB-C power adapter, and the M1 Max chip, that will cost you a cool $6,099, according to Apple’s online store. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Onh-PLQjKp-E2itX50gqfMUGV4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936795/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_11.16.29_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the cost and specs of the most expensive MacBook Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9z6pp"&gt;That hefty price is the tally &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you buy any software for the machine, by the way; Apple helpfully recommends Final Cut Pro ($299.99) and Logic Pro ($199.99) on the MacBook Pro checkout page. Adding those brings the total price just shy of $6,600. Now that Apple has finally revealed the new computers, though, at least you can now know how much you’ll need to pay for the top one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regulators say GameStop rally ‘raises questions of market efficiency’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dcsbO2sVHANtkSG7Zo4iaotgVmY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012903/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CXkODB"&gt;On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission published &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22937070/staff_report_equity_options_market_struction_conditions_early_2021.pdf"&gt;an official staff report&lt;/a&gt; on the GameStop rally earlier this year, calling for more scrutiny of both short-seller activity and broker-dealers like Robinhood. The report is particularly harsh on Robinhood’s “payment for order flow” system, which rewards the company for increasing the number of trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkFbUR"&gt;Released under the anodyne name “Staff Report on Equity and Options Market Structure Conditions in Early 2021,” the report is the SEC’s first full opportunity to weigh in on the confusion surrounding GameStop’s unlikely stock market rally, as well as some of the Robinhood features that critics say made the rally more chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="REGv1Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In January, the number of daily GameStop traders jumped from less than 10,000 to nearly 900,000&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGtWlG"&gt;In January, a cohort of online investors rallied around GameStop, driving up the share price of a company that had been on the verge of bankruptcy and spurring accusations of market manipulation from both sides. The SEC has been promising a full report on the situation &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/23/investors-await-sec-chair-genslers-report-on-gamestop-and-how-brokerages-get-paid.html"&gt;for months&lt;/a&gt; — but the report delivered today will do little to quiet concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJ46qq"&gt;The SEC report illustrates the sudden interest in GameStop by tracking the number of unique accounts that traded the stock each day. Over the course of January 2021, the number of daily unique traders increased from less than 10,000 to nearly 900,000. From January 13th to 14th alone, the number jumped by more than 50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeBdrX"&gt;The SEC names a number of overlapping causes for the GameStop rally: Significant price shifts, large changes in the volume of trading, leveraged bets from short-sellers, and significant public attention driven first by online communities like /r/wallstreetbets and later by establishment media. The result allowed surges of investor interest to create wild swings in price, driving the stock up to nearly 20 times its original value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aVnPFH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“payment for order flow... may cause broker-dealers to find novel ways to increase customer trading”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXS9uI"&gt;The most controversial incident came when Robinhood, the stock trading app at the center of much of the hype, announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;no longer allow users to purchase GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt; — a move CEO Vlad Tenev attributed to an inability to cover orders &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/robinhood-says-restrictions-on-gamestop-due-to-tenfold-increase-in-deposit-requirements.html"&gt;while meeting deposit requirements&lt;/a&gt;. But while the SEC report does not find reason to doubt Tenev’s explanation, it does raise significant new questions about other aspects of the company’s business model. In particular, the report calls for new scrutiny of Robinhood’s gamification efforts, as well as the company’s “payment for order flow” revenue model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t73FIp"&gt;“Consideration should be given to whether game-like features and celebratory animations that are likely intended to create positive feedback from trading lead investors to trade more than they would otherwise,” the report concludes. “In addition, payment for order flow and the incentives it creates may cause broker-dealers to find novel ways to increase customer trading, including through the use of digital engagement practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryawK3"&gt;Payment for order flow has long been a controversial and complex practice. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297548/michael-bolton-public-payment-order-flow-investment-robinhood"&gt;Explained by Michael Bolton here&lt;/a&gt;, it essentially allows Robinhood to charge market makers for early access to a portion of retail investors' trades. But while financial experts have largely dismissed concerns around front-running, the model does create an incentive for broker-dealers like Robinhood to maximize the number of trades its users make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8uE3w"&gt;Gary Gensler, the SEC chairman, has questioned whether payment for order flow is good business. In an &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-chairman-says-banning-payment-for-order-is-on-the-table-51630350595"&gt;August speech&lt;/a&gt;, he said that banning the practice was “on the table.” That would upend the business model for several of the mobile trading platforms that have sprung up, including Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMc2f3"&gt;The report emphasizes that volatility in GameStop’s share price existed long before the company became an investment meme. The share price fell as low as $3 in April of 2020, and Chewy founder Ryan Cohen’s growing involvement had already inspired significant jumps in the company’s valuation. That made GameStop stock an attractive target for both short sellers and boosters even before the internet got involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcI68h"&gt;The report also backs up claims that GameStop was an unusually heavily shorted stock, but it disputes the claim that short-sellers were the primary reason for the continued rally. “Whether driven by a desire to squeeze short sellers,” the report found, “or by belief in the fundamentals of GameStop, it was the positive sentiment, not the buying-to-cover, that sustained the weeks-long price appreciation of GameStop stock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4D7yFW"&gt;Still, the report does find that the incident “raises questions of market efficiency that relate to short selling,” and the conclusion calls for improved reporting of short sales to allow regulators better visibility into the dynamics of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ukBnPl"&gt;Sony is testing a way to share screenshots and video captures taken on your PS5 with the PlayStation app, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationCA/status/1450150469788225536"&gt;the company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature is part of a “limited-release beta” available to all PS5 users in Canada and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0JyGS"&gt;Once you have the feature enabled, new captures should start to show up in the app. “Video clips and screenshots of games are available in [the PlayStation app] for 14 days after you manually create them on your PS5 console,” Sony says in an FAQ. You won’t need a PlayStation Plus membership to use the feature (at least in this beta).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMomeW"&gt;However, clips can only have a resolution of up to 1920x1080 to appear in the app — Sony says clips in a higher resolution won’t be uploaded. If you delete a screenshot or video from your console, you’ll still be able to access it on the PlayStation app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5xaqI"&gt;Sony has a page with &lt;a href="https://t.co/afVHXLbJsZ?amp=1"&gt;more information here&lt;/a&gt;, but you might have some trouble accessing it — I’m based in the US and couldn’t access it, but my colleague in Canada could. We’ve screencapped some of it in the gallery below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b4E13q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10814261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RHApTE"&gt;I’ve found that being able to see my captures on the Xbox app is really handy, so I hope this similar-sounding PlayStation version doesn’t take long to be released broadly. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s website indicates macOS Monterey will launch without Universal Control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqPRz0X5PEk6Blupf5Opn-CIQ-s=/219x0:2472x1502/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012873/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.07.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAVpOY"&gt;Universal Control, Apple’s upcoming feature that lets you control multiple devices with the same mouse and keyboard, will probably not be launching at the same time as macOS Monterey. While Apple has said that the OS upgrade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22725047/macos-monterey-release-date-compatibility-features-m1-pro-max-chip"&gt;will be available on October 25th&lt;/a&gt;, its features page has been updated to say that Universal Control will be “available later this fall,” &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/universal-control-macos-monterey-later-this-fall/"&gt;a change spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bP4Eiw"&gt;Universal Control was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;one of the most impressive demos at WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;, where Craig Federhigi dragged a file from an iPad across a MacBook’s screen and then dropped it onto an iMac. While Universal Control is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;mostly just Apple combining technologies&lt;/a&gt; that it’s been developing for years, if Apple wants the real-world experience to be as good as that demo, Universal Control will have to be pretty polished — so it’s not surprising that the feature is being pushed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpGs8J"&gt;While betas for Monterey have been available for months, Universal Control has been missing, so the public hasn’t actually gotten to try it out yet. It’s not the only feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;Apple’s announced and then delayed&lt;/a&gt;. SharePlay, which promises to let you watch videos and listen to music with friends over FaceTime, also wasn’t released with iOS and iPadOS 15. However, unlike Universal Control, SharePlay has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;at least shown up in a few iOS betas&lt;/a&gt;. (Some toggles for Universal Control have shown up in macOS betas but appear to be non-functional, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/universal-control-monterey-beta-10-beta-label/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXybZz"&gt;Curiously, on &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/"&gt;the macOS Monterey page&lt;/a&gt;, SharePlay and some other features are marked with an asterisk that denotes it as “coming later this fall,” whereas Universal Control is marked with a separate footnote to say that it’ll be “available later this fall.” It’s possible that the different notation is because they’ll be arriving at different times or that it’s just a symptom of the delays being noted at different times. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is reopening a movie theater in SoCal this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iAeTqRM664350AJr4OVT6ruSm00=/58x0:1618x1040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012789/PV_BayTheater_ComingSoon_1676x1040_46__5_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lmhAm4"&gt;Netflix will reopen the Bay Theatre at Palisades Village in Southern California beginning October 22nd, becoming the third physical theater with which the streamer has announced a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dj3OQ"&gt;The theater will reopen this weekend with Jeymes Samuel’s &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81077494"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a Western starring Zazie Beetz, Regina King, and Idris Elba, among other notable stars — beginning with multiple showings starting Friday. Adult tickets are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atomtickets.com%2Fcheckout%2F403661718%23%2Ftickets&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22733232%2Fnetflix-movie-theater-bay-palisades-village" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently listed&lt;/a&gt; for $12 each, while discounted and children’s tickets cost $10. Free first-come, first-served tickets to Netflix animated titles &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81199052"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vivo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Mitchells vs. The Machines&lt;/em&gt; will also be available at the box office today through Thursday, October 21st from 3PM to 6PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hA492G"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKz5kZr8mrg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VgXQOL"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20982216/netflix-paris-theater-movies-new-york-oscars-irishman-marriage-story-egyptian"&gt;previously reopened&lt;/a&gt; the Paris Theater in New York in 2019, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/netflix-egyptian-theater-remodel/"&gt;working to restore&lt;/a&gt; the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood for a reopening in 2022. The third partnership for a theatrical space arrives as Netflix continues to explore additional points of entry to its originals beyond its app and website. In a press release, Netflix said it plans to use the space for special screenings, events, and theatrical releases for its films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVB0A4"&gt;“In addition to premieres and theatrical releases of upcoming Netflix films, audiences can look forward to family-oriented film programming, 35mm screenings of beloved classic films, in-person appearances and Q&amp;amp;As, free public events and much more,” Scott Stuber, head of global films at Netflix, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kznT85"&gt;According to Netflix, all shows during its opening weeks will come with free popcorn and beverages. The theater is being reopened as part of a partnership with Palisades Village parent Caruso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2bqdi"&gt;After the theater’s reopening with &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall, &lt;/em&gt;Netflix plans to premiere a handful of its other highly anticipated titles. These include action flick &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6l3mM7AWew"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which stars Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot — as well as Adam McKay’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL9aJcqrtnw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a star-studded cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Jonah Hill, and Timothée Chalamet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to get the new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1wqsi01nQVfcCWF0ZB0R48QIwo=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012700/1Rm4aV2YiD.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s latest MacBook Pros tout new silicon, a Mini LED display, and a MagSafe 3 connector.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J8SCzS"&gt;As expected, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488347"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; brought a number of new additions to Apple’s lineup, including a pair of new laptops in the form of new versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22488779"&gt;14-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Azd3ng"&gt;Both versions of the 2021 MacBook Pro are configurable with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;newly announced M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, which build greatly on the improvements made by the M1 CPU that debuted last year. Besides the beefier processor, the new versions of the MacBook Pro have enhanced GPU performance, battery life, and a host of new connectivity options, including a trio of Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI output, and an SD card reader in addition to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733119/apple-new-macbook-pro-magsafe-back"&gt;MagSafe 3 connector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We haven’t had the opportunity to put them through their paces, but if you want to preorder either of the forthcoming models ahead of our full review, both are available starting today at the Apple Store and begin shipping next week. Keep in mind, however, that availability looks to be limited for some configurations, with some models expected to ship as late as early December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to the sick Mac sound effect song that Apple opened its keynote with </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uY6Pp8hTo7Xm_ldpHYleUyJF9-g=/284x0:2114x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70012561/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_5.41.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIA9kE"&gt;Apple kicked off its MacBook Pro keynote a little differently today: with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxJpZtp2ItE"&gt;sweet remix of classic Apple sound effects&lt;/a&gt; from the past 45 years of the company’s history, created by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0dvX0R4NEh6cmxKUFFXdDlXT3pxblpjSUVWZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttQmtJOGJHZ1NiTmVBazdlTG80dkV0MnBuQUU0OFhKR3J0RVlpNUZWM0xiNHkySjA2RWRkTnU5SVI0c1psN2tkYnlsY3dxal9JVEtkR2lfdTl6N21UcUlFSGJWbWZKOEc2WWVXSWNsX0FRbU5WTi1USQ&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.co%2FAGCook"&gt;artist A. G. Cook&lt;/a&gt; — using Apple’s Pro Display XDR, MacBook Pro, and Logic Pro, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49Hal6"&gt;The song itself is called “Start Up” and is a surprisingly chill listening experience. The video’s fun, too, featuring a wide array of Apple hardware from throughout the years, including old iBooks and the sadly defunct iPod Hi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQUcqRr25H-9Yj4KSE-TIFRE2bE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936838/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_5.41.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bPBWkV"&gt;The full list of sound effects trend toward Apple’s more recent hardware, of course, but there are a few classic Easter eggs, too. The full list of sound effects, provided by Apple, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="keslCD"&gt;iMac G3 startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WsFibI"&gt;MacBook Pro startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gUMox"&gt;AirPods case closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iENqaM"&gt; iOS alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="19KsE9"&gt;HomePod minimum volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QkTl69"&gt;iPod click wheel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N08tNj"&gt;Note alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QK6g0W"&gt;Email whoosh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MtJxRE"&gt;MagSafe charger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pcRSta"&gt;Night Owl ringtone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gs0nFn"&gt;HomePod Nope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UyL7mt"&gt;HomePod PingPong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J08BLz"&gt;Mac 2020 alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FARvhE"&gt;Empty trash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YyUbTW"&gt;Message sent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qiy8Gm"&gt;Message received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7JEF8v"&gt;HomePod device identify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zRWhne"&gt;iPhone keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3ZnEt"&gt;AirDrop invite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0pdpSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosumi"&gt;Mac Sosumi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VW7GQZ"&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Hli3FT"&gt;It’s fitting that Cook (no relation to Apple’s CEO) would produce today’s Apple remix, given that he released his second album, &lt;em&gt;Apple&lt;/em&gt; (no relation to the multitrillion-dollar tech company) in 2020. It’s not clear whether Apple and Cook will release “Start Up” on Apple Music — which, admittedly, would make a lot of sense — but you can enjoy Cook’s chill tech-inspired beats here. &lt;/p&gt;
