    <title>ViacomCBS again restructures its leadership in its bid to win the streaming wars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypISp02O941Mtaa7SwStQ3XMx-U=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500899/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g0tSRB"&gt;ViacomCBS is once again changing up leadership to emphasize its focus on streaming and ensure the success of its streaming services, particularly its late-to-the-party content giant Paramount Plus. The announcement comes just a day after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-ceo-built-a-cable-giant-can-he-build-a-streaming-giant-11624473722"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; NBCUniversal had approached ViacomCBS about joining streaming forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCk3aJ"&gt;ViacomCBS &lt;a href="https://ir.viacomcbs.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-announces-enhanced-streaming-content-leadership"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; title changes and additional oversight for several of its executives currently overseeing various ViacomCBS content properties, particularly for its recently launched Paramount Plus streaming service. Leadership reorganizations focused on streaming have become standard for major parent companies of recently launched services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514728/disney-streaming-reorganization-plus-espn-hulu-studios-movies-network-tv-shows-pandemic"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21359128/warnermedia-reorg-bob-greenblatt-kevin-reilly-hbo-max-jason-kilar-streaming"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; — and ViacomCBS has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524771/viacomcbs-all-access-paramount-plus-reorganization-disney-netflix"&gt;previously seen&lt;/a&gt; internal shifts meant to prop up Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBIfdJ"&gt;In a statement, ViacomCBS boss Bob Bakish said Paramount Plus’ first few months “have demonstrated the power and potential of our platform, as well as audiences’ appetite for a broad and diverse array of content, all in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gn5InD"&gt;Tanya Giles, who serves as the general manager of MTV Entertainment Group, has been promoted to chief programming officer of streaming at the company and will specifically focus on content for Paramount Plus and Pluto TV. ViacomCBS reported reaching &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/viacomcbs-grows-global-streaming-subscribers-paramount-plus-1234948505/"&gt;36 million global paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; back in May. But that figure is towered over by services like Disney Plus and Netflix, which have zoomed past the 100 million- and 200 million-subscription mark, respectively. Giles’ new role, while one of several announced this week, is among the more significant changes in the company’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OIyGv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paramount Plus’ first few months “have demonstrated the power and potential of our platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ScfU8i"&gt;CBS president and CEO George Cheeks now additionally holds the title of chief content officer of news and sports at Paramount Plus. Chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, Jim Gianopulos, is now also chief content officer of movies at Paramount Plus. Bruce Gillmer, who is president of music, music talent, programming, and events will oversee music at the service, while MTV Entertainment Group president Chris McCarthy now also holds the title of chief content officer of unscripted entertainment and adult animation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6jYjf"&gt;Chairman and CEO of Showtime Networks, David Nevins, now additionally holds the role of chief content officers of scripted originals at Paramount Plus. An &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/emmy-winner-david-nevins-joins-25036/"&gt;Emmy-winning producer&lt;/a&gt;, Nevins was attached to &lt;a href="https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/showtime/executives/view?id=23"&gt;award-winning productions&lt;/a&gt; that include &lt;em&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt;, and his promotion as a key figure within the Paramount Plus C-suite seems smart on the part of ViacomCBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QljTN7"&gt;Meanwhile, Nicole Clemens, president of Paramount Television Studios, will also oversee Paramount Plus’ original scripted series. Lastly, Brian Robbins, president of kids and family entertainment, will now also hold the title of chief content officer of kids and family programming at Paramount Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v74gdu"&gt;The restructure comes at an interesting time for the company. Paramount Plus, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;launched in March&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the now seemingly innumerable streaming services all competing for subscribers. It’s unclear whether ViacomCBS’s long-game strategy is an eventual merger along the lines of the recent deal between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451111/att-ceo-stankey-unleash-assets-warnermedia-discovery-hbo"&gt;WarnerMedia and Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, but reports from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcasts-ceo-built-a-cable-giant-can-he-build-a-streaming-giant-11624473722"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nbcuniversals-streaming-strategy-raise-prospect-of-warnermedia-merger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicated NBCUniversal had approached ViacomCBS about teaming up. According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, ViacomCBS declined that offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVSC6N"&gt;By the looks of it, ViacomCBS is instead amassing a leadership team to help its scrappy service compete in the streaming wars in earnest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ADT and Ring reach settlement in trademark dispute over octagonal blue signs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1GaZZQm-j4yY0CL1jQWbNG2adqI=/86x0:1000x609/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500850/PMP_desktop_outdoor_siren_alarm_2.0_3024x3024_e776dee7_766f_46bd_8a04_69e509429231_1000x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jLpyaB"&gt;ADT has settled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405245/adt-ring-blue-octagon-design-trademark-dispute-lawsuit"&gt;trademark dispute lawsuit against Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which it brought against the Amazon-owned company because of what it called a “striking similarity” between Ring’s Outdoor Siren and ADT’s blue octagon signs. According to &lt;a href="https://news.adt.com/news-releases/news-release-details/adt-and-ring-settle-trademark-dispute"&gt;ADT’s press release&lt;/a&gt; and a statement from a Ring spokesperson, Ring will stop selling the current design of its Outdoor Siren and release a new version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zC8MnDwVjLfbIwKj_qL53r2v438=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22472686/msedge_hdavxHV40l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;ADT v. Ring&lt;/em&gt; court filing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Outdoor Siren versus ADT’s sign.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jgPhR8"&gt;ADT filed the suit in April, asking a judge for both cash compensation and a halt on Ring selling products that looked like ADT’s blue sign. Neither company mentioned whether there was a monetary amount as part of the settlement, only that they were “pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCONIU"&gt;Currently, Ring’s US page for the Outdoor Siren leads to a 404, but the product &lt;a href="https://en-uk.ring.com/products/alarm-security-outdoor-siren"&gt;is still available in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7STuH"&gt;The two home security companies have had disagreements before: in 2017, Ring was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/5/16609880/ring-barred-from-selling-security-system-adt-lawsuit-z1"&gt;ordered to stop selling certain products&lt;/a&gt; after ADT claimed the company had benefited from proprietary information. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.securitysales.com/automation/smart-home/ring-reaches-settlement-with-adt-in-zonoff-lawsuit-plus-other-developments/"&gt;reportedly ended up settling&lt;/a&gt; that case. ADT had also previously asked Ring to make &lt;a href="https://ring.com/collections/accessories/products/solar-security-sign"&gt;its outdoor sign&lt;/a&gt; look less like ADT’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCzt1HhbdwwlJKXs9npDPwzd0xw=/547x275:2814x1786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500824/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_3.53.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/forgeyourfate"&gt;Steam summer sale&lt;/a&gt; will continue through July 8th, with quite a few beloved titles well below market rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sC3qIf"&gt;Which ones? Glad you asked. &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Supergiant’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"&gt;beloved&lt;/a&gt; roguelike &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, From Software’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277376/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;punishing ninja game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363127/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-port-review-performance"&gt;recently PC-ported&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976310/Mortal_Kombat11/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat 11&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;open-world coffee-drinking simulator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174180/Red_Dead_Redemption_2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are all at least 30 percent off. &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1238810/Battlefield_V/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is less than $13. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"&gt;Unsettling cinematic platformer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/INSIDE/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is only $4.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10PKTB"&gt;This sale also features a micro text adventure called &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/forgeyourfate"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forge Your Fate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and by micro, I truly mean micro — each subsection has only two choices) that will net you some free digital stickers, if you’re into that sort of thing. The cosmetics continue with new &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/c/profilebundles"&gt;profile bundles&lt;/a&gt; of backgrounds, avatars, and the like, purchasable with Steam Points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwsKpu"&gt;Did I mention &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is 35 percent off? Because it is. Just wanted to make sure you knew.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the visual changes Microsoft showed off in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zKjQ5ptVeNWrJj3_fE5qTx0Y2RE=/242x0:2639x1598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500696/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_9.30.02_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="72rbg2"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;announced Windows 11 today&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the headline features of the “next generation” operating system is its visual overhaul. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7y1S3wIysg"&gt;released an entire video&lt;/a&gt; about how it designed its new OS, which shows off the new rounded corners, icons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nemj1J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7y1S3wIysg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5iIUPo"&gt;Here’s a look at some of the UI changes Microsoft showed off in its presentation today (along with some that we got a look at from subsequent videos), and how they compare to Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ncZdgc"&gt;The Start menu and taskbar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="yJJXNT"&gt;Microsoft has moved the Start button from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/11/10923808/microsoft-windows-start-menu-20-years-visual-history"&gt;its time-honored place in the lower left-hand corner&lt;/a&gt; to the middle of the screen. While it’s a smaller change than what Microsoft did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/28/3122873/windows-8-start-button-explanation-chaitanya-sareen"&gt;with the Start screen in Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still likely going to take some getting used to — for some, it’ll be going against over 25 years of muscle memory. The pinned taskbar items are also moving with it, taking center stage on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9qzVX"&gt;(Microsoft will let people move things back to the left if they don’t like the change, though, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/windows-11-a-guide-to-microsofts-next-big-release-11624549583?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuTv28"&gt;Clicking that Start button reveals the updated Start menu, which Microsoft says is powered by the cloud and Office 365. Where the Start menu in Windows 10 mostly acted as a list of apps, the version in Windows 11 will recommend which apps and documents you may like to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Q_XbDjIUETb-Ie1vQRYWOmAb5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679506/WIN_Start_GenZ_Light_16x10_en_US_1024x640.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8eLQKHYfZV9q7UxSwzENuKu8cXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679505/2021_06_24_09_42_05_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 10 Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="l2KEoL"&gt;Widgets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4SHTjg"&gt;Live Tiles, which used to live in the Start menu, have been replaced by widgets, which get their own space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkvZNbWOjf3SMPDbOiSLWdbNB9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679436/WIN_Widgets_Light_Theme_16x9_en_US_1_1024x576.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDaU2de0KvquElwtJPChSNDUAtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679433/2021_06_24_10_16_14_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10’s Live Tiles in the Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4RVNrU"&gt;The Microsoft Store&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="EX3DGQ"&gt;Microsoft says it’s rebuilt its store to make it faster and to give it a new design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RdEFen"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10622500"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QliL96"&gt;More snaps for Windows Snap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="cNp05C"&gt;Windows 11 also has a new UI for selecting which layout you want to snap to. We’ve been able to easily snap apps side by side since Windows 7, and Microsoft’s added additional layouts over time, but we haven’t seen a built-in windowing manager with this many options  (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20852451/microsoft-windows-10-powertoys-download-features"&gt;Microsoft’s FancyZones was a separate download&lt;/a&gt;). The older suggestion system &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/J8phSH6cuS0?t=240"&gt;does appear to still be in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyF0tYJd8EOCRQZqI1LgOj43jVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679449/WIN_SnapAssist_Light_16x9_en_US_1_1024x576.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="BNnerl"&gt;Modern icons &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="x3fxfF"&gt;Microsoft is giving its icons some much-needed attention in Windows 11, finally overhauling some of the images that have been around since the ‘90s — though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;they might still include floppy disks&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft shows off some of the new icons in the image below, but you can also find them throughout today’s videos and demos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Bq3NIBCourdSVX2eClxWowKBiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679568/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_11.13.00_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the new icons Microsoft showed off for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7bxHFw"&gt;File Explorer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="geNxWH"&gt;File Explorer’s top bar has also seemingly got some tweaks — the tabs appear to be gone, replaced by a row of buttons that appear to be more optimized for touch. The aforementioned new icons also add to the updated look.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxFCHEfbjFR63gpmEHUIPrmxK_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679465/ZiM0K2r.png"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LLdhQ5Q1bS77CIC3OQ3hwAkArl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679556/2021_06_24_11_05_32_Downloads.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A similar view in Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YrsecS"&gt;Tablet mode&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6Um5Wt"&gt;Microsoft also showed off Windows 11’s touchscreen prowess — while Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/29/9055743/microsoft-windows-10-tablet-mode-mobile-os"&gt;did have a tablet mode&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548950/microsoft-windows-11-skype-onenote-live-tiles-cortana"&gt;being deprecated&lt;/a&gt; in favor of a subtle transition to a full-screen experience, where your taskbar simply spreads out the icons a bit more, adds “subtle visual cues” and increases the sizes of touch targets to make windows easier to drag and tap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vii83kglYoSFUqW-3YKA4db0GJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679589/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_11.14.00_AM.png"&gt;

&lt;h1 id="WZLkBL"&gt;Microsoft Teams integration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="MKaWPy"&gt;Windows 11 will include Microsoft Teams, Microsoft’s communications app, right in your Start menu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;and it’ll be integrated directly into Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Right-clicking the (redesigned) Teams icon in Windows 11 shows many more options than are available in Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9m8v6ayQ7ZWE2vJMuwtWqepZ_5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679500/WIN_Teams_Integration_16x9_en_US_1_1024x576.png"&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xyrtR8vLgcHKOzd4fq_XWmIefxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679499/2021_06_24_09_52_41_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right-clicking on the Teams taskbar icon in Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzxiwkBq5FvoXha9yyShWdNUebs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22661987/windows11wallpapers.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wallpapers in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0xKmhg"&gt;Microsoft has a collection of new wallpapers for Windows 11, with the default one looking like a glassy, fabric-y piece of coral. We have a whole post &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536375/microsoft-windows-11-default-wallpaper"&gt;about the new wallpapers here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xwjoto"&gt;The look and feel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="P5qBdx"&gt;Of course, there are changes that apply to the entire OS, not just parts of it. Transparency, especially when it comes to color, seems to be a heavy part of Windows 11, and Microsoft says it’s literally rounding out all the sharp edges in the UI. The OS also just has a more glassy, clean look overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YY2feW"&gt;There are, however, times where it’ll likely be hard to tell Windows 10 and 11 apart. I was able to recreate one of Microsoft’s screenshots, and while there are differences, it does show that app design is also a big part of user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Optimum is dramatically reducing cable internet speeds to be better ‘aligned with the industry’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpPbgj8QDx0m1TDreu8BIiNY-zQ=/0x1:1218x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500476/optimum.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ss7tPb"&gt;Internet service provider Optimum, owned by Altice USA, is &lt;a href="https://www.optimum.net/pages/optimum-packages-speed-details.html"&gt;dramatically reducing cable internet speeds&lt;/a&gt; for new subscribers starting on July 12th. For some Optimum Online plans, upload speeds will be cut from 35Mbps to as little as 5Mbps, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/06/cable-isp-altice-slashes-upload-speeds-from-35mbps-to-as-low-as-5mbps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeSpmA"&gt;The change impacts new customers still serviced by Optimum’s older, non-fiber network, and it will only impact current subscribers if they upgrade, downgrade, or otherwise change their service. Download speeds should remain the same, but you can see how upload speeds are slowed below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DUgbKCBurgfCsZLbfTVVFcJJK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_9.02.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimum’s speed reductions to their internet-only plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="73z4Oh"&gt;Lowering the speeds, sometimes by as much as 86 percent in the case of the basic Optimum Online plan, could impact a range of daily internet tasks, from uploading files to making video calls. It could be frustrating to anyone currently working from home, but it’s even more confounding because apparently there isn’t a great reason for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztiKdj"&gt;Optimum’s owner Altice tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that increased traffic isn’t the justification for throttling its entire customer base. “Our network continues to perform very well despite the significant data usage increase during the pandemic,” a company spokesperson wrote. Changing the upload speeds, the spokesperson said, brings the plan “in-line with other ISPs and aligned with the industry.” When asked to confirm if that’s why the speeds were lowered, the Altice spokesperson reiterated the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="746DOJ"&gt;Actually verifying that claim is more than a little difficult. Many ISPs &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/comcast-hides-upload-speeds-deep-inside-its-infuriating-ordering-system/"&gt;aren’t particularly forthcoming&lt;/a&gt; with their upload speeds, presumably because none of them are great. Comcast’s Xfinity service, while not offering all of the same download speeds as Optimum, does match its 5Mbps upload speeds on a 100Mbps download plan and 35Mbps upload speeds on a Gigabit 940Mbps download plan, according to third-party site &lt;a href="https://www.cabletv.com/xfinity/internet"&gt;CableTV.com&lt;/a&gt;. Cox &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cox.com%2Faboutus%2Fpolicies%2Fspeeds-and-data-plans.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F24%2F22548774%2Foptimum-altice-reduced-cable-speeds-upload-throttling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has the same 35Mbps upload speeds&lt;/a&gt; on its “Gigablast” 940Mbps download plan as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvKSt4"&gt;Optimum does offer symmetrical upload and download speeds on its “100 percent fiber network,” Altice says, but you might not find that coverage everywhere, and there are no guarantees that your neighborhood is one where the company will be expanding to next. Currently, fiber only covers 20 percent of Optimum’s total footprint, &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/opticalip/fttx/altice-usas-fttp-rollout-eclipses-1m-homes-passed/d/d-id/769122"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which equates to about 1 million homes. That leaves a lot of people potentially dealing with the new slower speeds after July 12th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big Tech edges closer to break up after deeply unhinged markup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Second Impeachment Trial Of Donald J. Trump Continues In Senate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5w-PKxgeI5rsE7k3Si27lJXyCDY=/0x0:4683x3122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500397/1231082774.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joshua Roberts-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mvhFbP"&gt;After nearly two years of investigations, the House Judiciary Committee met Wednesday to push forward on a package of bills targeting the power large tech companies like Amazon and Facebook hold over the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SQwBu"&gt;“With this package of historic legislation, we have the opportunity to take control of our own destiny to be a global leader in developing rules of the road for the digital economy,” Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said at the top of the hearing. “We cannot be complacent and we cannot delay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4nOEo5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We cannot be complacent and we cannot delay”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbth64"&gt;But while all six bills were eventually approved out of committee... delay, delay, the lawmakers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fI4GoA"&gt;The markup kicked off Wednesday morning and lasted through Thursday afternoon with a few short breaks in between. The package was introduced earlier this month with broad bipartisan support. But this week’s markup shows that there are still fractures in both the Republican and Democratic caucuses, signaling that the measures aren’t out of hot water yet and could still fail when they come up for an (undetermined) final vote on the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tiKCqe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKAY, BUT WHAT DO THE BILLS SAY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XJaARL"&gt;Lawmakers started off with some of the less controversial measures. At the top, they approved a bill that would update filing fees for mergers for the first time in nearly two decades. The bill, called the&lt;strong&gt; Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act&lt;/strong&gt;, would give the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission more money to take on antitrust cases against tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t84Dh7"&gt;Another bill, called the &lt;strong&gt;State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act&lt;/strong&gt;, was also approved favorably and heads to the House floor for a final vote. If it passes, the bill would make sure state attorneys general who file federal antitrust cases against a company like Facebook would be able to have that case heard in the court they select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhCIOt"&gt;Things got a lot testier once the committee reached the third bill, the&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCESS Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— especially among Democrats representing California, the home of Silicon Valley. The bill outlines new standards for data portability and interoperability. Democrats like Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Republicans like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) argued that the bill could make it easier for American companies to transfer user data to Chinese ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7kVtd"&gt;The bill was later approved, but Democrats, like Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), promised that their decision to push the bill through committee didn’t mean that they will vote for it later on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSSDcR"&gt;Early Thursday morning, lawmakers moved on to the &lt;strong&gt;Platform Competition and Opportunity Act&lt;/strong&gt;. The measure would bar large tech platforms from buying up nascent competitors — think &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/"&gt;Facebook buying Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. After hours of debate, it was approved, but with three California Democrats voting against the measure. Before ending at 5AM Thursday, lawmakers also approved the &lt;strong&gt;American Choice and Innovation Act&lt;/strong&gt;, a nondiscrimination measure&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that bars companies like Google from giving preference to their own products on their own services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARuElC"&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;Ending Platform Monopolies Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;made its way out of the committee. It would force large companies like Amazon to sell off different lines of business that conflict with one another. The bill eliminates the ability of large platforms to use the control they have in different lines of business to hurt competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSH9bK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vh0XpL"&gt;Well, they’re headed to the House floor! There will be over 400 lawmakers voting on these bills instead of the couple dozen who marked them up over the last couple hours. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) seems eager to approve these measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRlpOt"&gt;At a press conference Thursday, Pelosi told reporters, “There has been concern on both sides of the aisle about the consolidation of power of the tech companies and this legislation is an attempt to address that.” She continued, “We are not going to ignore the consolidation that has happened and the concern that exists on both sides of the aisle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsfjBk"&gt;Of the six bills, the merger filing fee measure is the only one headed into conference where House and Senate lawmakers will tinker with the language before it lands on President Biden’s desk. The other five will also need to be introduced in the Senate, move through the committee process, and reach at least 60 votes on the floor, so long as the filibuster stays in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avDra4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-says-working-companion-bills-house-antitrust-measures-2021-06-15/"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she would be introducing companion legislation for some of those measures in the Senate. As of publication, it’s unclear when those bills will be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pzuHl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 6/24/21 at 3:12 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified that the Klobuchar plans to introduce some companion bills, but not one for each piece of House legislation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu3S9J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer Blade 14 review: pint-size power</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Razer puts the Blade 15’s power in a smaller package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L4THpQ"&gt;From the outside, the Razer Blade 14 looks like every other Razer Blade laptop that we’ve seen in the past few years. It’s got the all-aluminum chassis, the RGB keyboard, the three-headed snake logo, and the subtle black vibe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuA9Uj"&gt;But this Razer Blade is very different. It’s the first Blade ever to be powered by an AMD processor. That chip — the Ryzen 9 5900HX — has enabled Razer to put out the most powerful 14-inch gaming laptop ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEwav2"&gt;That’s not just due to the CPU’s raw power. The efficiency of AMD’s product has given Razer the headroom to include Nvidia’s top-of-the-line RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 mobile graphics cards. This is the first 14-inch laptop with those chips. Asus’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;, which has topped all kinds of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists for the past year, maxes out at an RTX 3060. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ypAprJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10622114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="623fmn"&gt;Of course, whether this laptop is a remarkable achievement for Razer is a different question from whether you should actually buy it. The Blade 14 isn’t a cheap system — our test unit costs $2,199.99 — and many folks may justifiably want a bigger screen for that price. But if portability is your priority, this laptop should be on your list. It’s got a mix of performance, specs, and build quality that you won’t find anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xtyEYO"&gt;The system I reviewed comes with a 100W RTX 3070, in addition to 16GB of RAM (which is not upgradable), 1TB of SSD storage (expandable up to 2TB), and a 165Hz QHD display. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0369BEA2-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That same price&lt;/a&gt; can also get you a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; with similar GPU and RAM, but with a six-core Intel Core i7 processor and 512GB of storage. The Blade 14 is also thinner and over half a pound lighter: the Blade 15 Base is 4.6 pounds and 0.78 inches thick, while the 14 is 3.92 pounds and 0.66 inches thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iOIRI"&gt;But the Blade 14 is still expensive as ultraportable gaming laptops go — you’re paying a &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-Stealth-13%2FRZ09-03272E12-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 premium&lt;/a&gt; over the FHD 120Hz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13&lt;/a&gt; (which has a much weaker GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q GPU and a lower refresh rate screen) and $200 more than the top &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM300000011/A50184-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-AniMe-Matrix-Ultra-Slim-Gaming-Laptop%2C-14%E2%80%9D-120Hz-PANTONE-Validated-QHD-Display%2C-GeForce-RTX-3060%2C-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HS%2C-32GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-SSD%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-Windows-10-Pro%2C-GA401QM-XS98Q-WH"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; (which has an RTX 3060, but also 32GB of RAM and a fancy dot matrix on its lid). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdGAaI"&gt;Elsewhere, you can get a &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14%2FRZ09-0370AE23-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799.99 Blade 14&lt;/a&gt; with a 144Hz FHD screen and an RTX 3060, and &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14%2FRZ09-0370CEA3-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,799.99&lt;/a&gt; can get you an RTX 3080 with the QHD display. (There’s no touchscreen option.) We haven’t seen an earth-shattering performance difference between RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 systems — 3070s can even outperform 3080s, depending on wattage and clock speeds — so it’s hard to imagine an RTX 3080 Blade 14 really being worth $600 more. (You could literally buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Zephyrus-Gaming-GeForce-Moonlight/dp/B088PDB63Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Zephyrus G14s&lt;/a&gt; for that price.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The arrow keys on the Razer Blade 14 laptop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeQpPkfg2d3pqby6yrRStCwyYXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675599/mchin_210621_4641_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade laptops no longer have the tiny arrow keys that made everyone mad for a while.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5QJJKR"&gt;It seems like Razer has priced this RTX 3070 unit correctly, because the performance I saw was very, very comparable to what we saw from the Blade 15 Base with an RTX 3070. That means it’s blowing smaller laptops, like the Stealth 13 and the Zephyrus G14, out of the water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5zLrkw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10622119"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hol1EW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption &lt;/em&gt;running on its Ultra preset averaged 58fps — just one frame away from the Blade 15 Base. (All games were run at native resolution.) The game averaged 51fps with every slider manually maxed out, which is still decently playable. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn &lt;/em&gt;ran at 70fps, also just one frame worse than the Blade 15 Base. The Blade 14 actually beat the Blade 15 on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; where it averaged 51fps with ray tracing on ultra (the Blade 15 averaged 46fps) and 81fps with ray tracing off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0niDsz"&gt;These numbers make a fairly compelling case for buying the AMD-powered Blade 14 over the Intel-powered Blade 15 Base. The Blade 14 gives you almost identical gaming performance but double the storage at no extra cost. It’s also significantly thinner and lighter, and its eight-core processor will give you an advantage over the Blade 15’s six-core processor in heavy multicore tasks. You’ll want the Blade 15 if you need a bigger screen, of course, but I don’t see many other arguments in its favor at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2m1Bw7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These numbers make a fairly compelling case for buying the AMD-powered Blade 14 over the Intel-powered Blade 15 Base&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aIbxpr"&gt;Just for comparison’s sake, the Blade Stealth 13 only averaged 45fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing off, which is a very noticeable difference. The Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 2060 put up 74fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; sans ray tracing, and 31fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;. Note that both of these laptops were running the games in FHD, so that performance gap is bigger than the numbers make it seem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGFK3X"&gt;Where the Blade 14 did fall behind was in our export test. It took seven minutes and six seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in Adobe Premiere Pro. That’s slower than the Blade 15 Base took, and over a minute slower than the Stealth 13. AMD systems tend to lag behind Intel ones on this task — Intel’s Quick Sync feature is likely a factor. But the Blade 14 did handily beat its &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=32198"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=22790"&gt;siblings&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=44616"&gt;PugetBench for Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt; benchmark, which measures performance on a variety of Premiere Pro tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Blade 14 keyboard seen from above and to the right. The keys are lit a dark pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wav2YGrCOOh-DTY5jyZg6vjzWxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675600/mchin_210621_4641_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can integrate your RGB scheme with your room’s lighting if you have Phillips Hue products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L9969c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10622133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOY9WY"&gt;Battery life was acceptable, but not as tremendous as we’ve seen from some recent AMD systems. I averaged six hours and 12 minutes of continuous work with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s not terrible — it’s still not uncommon to see gaming laptops die after just a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22385493/msi-stealth-15m-gaming-laptop-specs-performance-review"&gt;few hours&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;on battery&lt;/a&gt; — but a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;AMD rigs&lt;/a&gt; are also breaking the eight-hour mark these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUtXGS"&gt;Finally, the Blade 14 includes Razer’s new “next-gen” vapor chamber cooling, which includes dual 88-blade fans with blades that are just 0.1mm thick. Unfortunately, the system struggled to keep up with its chips. I often saw the 5900HX jump into the high 90s (Celsius) during gaming and other intense loads. It was consistently hanging out in the high 80s at other times during testing. The good news is that none of that heat ended up where I could feel it: the bottom of the chassis, keyboard, and palm rests never got uncomfortably toasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QbNWK9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The whole chassis is CNC aluminum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUDuhu"&gt;In case you’ve never used a Razer laptop before, their signature feature (apart from the gaming performance) is the RGB keyboard. The Blade 14 has per-key RGB lighting that you can customize in the Razer Synapse software that comes pre-installed. While many colorful gaming keyboards look obnoxious and garish, Blade keyboards are subtle and chic, in part because there’s almost no backlight bleed from beneath the keys and the fonts are simple, not aggressive. I’d have no problem bringing this Blade to an office or coffee shop — the color is a flourish, rather than a distraction. The touchpad is also quite good, with a smooth texture and no palm rejection issues that I saw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjiuZr"&gt;The whole chassis is CNC aluminum, and it’s quite sturdy, though also a fingerprint magnet. There’s a respectable port selection, which will allow you to power up to three external displays at a time. You get one HDMI 2.1, in addition to two USB-C ports with DisplayPort 1.4, two USB-A ports, an audio jack, a lock slot, and a charging port. This is the =same port selection you’ll find on the Zephyrus G14. No Thunderbolt support, since that’s an Intel feature, but you do get Wi-Fi 6E (Gig+) and Bluetooth 5.2.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Blade 14 seen from above, open, angled to the left. The screen displays the Razer logo on a red and green background. The keys are lit a dark pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwiQhWyWsFdwVat4ELqOUWmQbBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675597/mchin_210621_4641_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a laptop like no other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ahb3Ky"&gt;Games also look great on the QHD display, which allowed me to take full advantage of the frame rates produced here. The screen maxed out at 310 nits in our testing, and it covered 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut. It’s got a matte texture, so I never had any issues with glare in bright settings. It is a 16:9 panel, which is a common aspect ratio to see on gaming laptops, but it does leave less vertical space for work and productivity than a 16:10 or 3:2 display. I’ve been happy to see a number of gaming flagships (such as Asus’ new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22425078/asus-intel-zephyrus-m16-gaming-laptop-tiger-lake-h-chips"&gt;Zephyrus M16&lt;/a&gt;) move over to 16:10 this past year — it makes for gaming laptops that are just a bit more versatile for everyday use as well. I’d hoped Razer might follow suit with this year’s Blades, but it looks like I’ll be waiting longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eofJVQ"&gt;I only have one real complaint with the Blade 14’s chassis features, and that’s the webcam. I’m happy that it does have a webcam — that’s not a given on gaming laptops these days. And it supports Windows Hello facial recognition, which is handy. Unfortunately, the camera is so bad that having it is almost (&lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt;) as bad as not having one at all. It’s quite grainy, and I looked dark even in bright settings. If I were using the Blade as my primary driver, I would probably buy an external camera for my Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CV1AEX"&gt;If you’re looking for the most power-per-pound you can get, the Razer Blade 14 is the ideal gaming laptop for you. Fourteen inches won’t be enough screen for everyone, of course, especially at this price point — and plenty of shoppers may be willing to give up the fancy RGB and a few frames per second in favor of the unbelievable battery life the Zephyrus G14 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;G15&lt;/a&gt; offer. There are a few knocks against the Blade — namely the poor webcam, the chassis’s fingerprint retention, and the steep price tag — but if none of those are dealbreakers for you, I see no reason not to recommend it. There’s really nothing else like it on the market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satya Nadella’s closing Windows 11 remarks were a direct shot across Apple’s bow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zH2ja7Kh13so9X9LQ_KEpKHxBW4=/159x0:1841x1121/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500045/lcimg_933b886b_dbb2_42fd_b7e3_69fe7c89bf06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L3Q5LE"&gt;At the end of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;surprisingly eventful, exciting presentation of Windows 11,&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella came on the video feed to deliver some closing remarks. He laid out his vision for Windows 11 as a “platform for platform creators,” and in doing so, he issued a subtle but nonetheless stinging critique of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9AiLx"&gt;Nadella’s speech was almost entirely about building a case that Windows would be a better platform for creators than either macOS or (especially) iOS. He argued that “there is no personal computing without personal agency,” insisting that users should be more in control of their computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wge8JZ"&gt;Nadella called out the changes Microsoft is making to its app store rules, allowing more types of apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Android apps&lt;/a&gt;, and — most importantly — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;allowing apps to use their own payment systems&lt;/a&gt; if they so choose. He said, “A platform can only serve society if its rules allow for this foundational innovation and category creation.” That rhetoric sounds vaguely nice and inspiring out of context, but in the specific context of the current debates, lawsuits, and legislation over app store rules, it’s a sharp and direct critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfSiyZ"&gt;More than anything, though, Nadella and Microsoft are putting their finger on an emerging trend in the debate about app store policies: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525904/fanhouse-apple-tax-app-store-creator-fees"&gt;how they affect individual creators&lt;/a&gt;. Alluding to Ben Thompson’s recent article about “&lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/"&gt;sovereign writers&lt;/a&gt;,” Nadella says, “Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.” Microsoft even went so far as to build a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548804/microsoft-windows-11-news-feed-creators-tipping"&gt;direct tipping feature for creators&lt;/a&gt; into Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvdVLP"&gt;It’s fair to call this critique opportunistic. After all, Microsoft itself tried to build an app store ecosystem for Windows that utterly failed to match the level of success we’ve seen for the iPhone (or Android, for that matter). It’s a truism that, in tech, the underdog always calls for openness until they’re the top dog — and Microsoft’s app store is definitely the underdog. But just because a critique is opportunistic doesn’t mean it’s not &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c59K8H"&gt;Nadella ends by alluding to &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=88CV8JOYUmsC&amp;amp;pg=PA453&amp;amp;lpg=PA453&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuthors+can+be+divided+into+meteors,+planets+and+fixed+stars.+The+meteors+produce+a+loud+momentary+effect;+we+look+up,+shout+%27see+there!%27+and+then+they+are+gone+for+ever.+The+planets+and+comets+last+for+a+much+longer+time....The+fixed+stars+alone+are+constant+and+unalterable;+their+position+in+the+firmament+is+fixed;+they+have+their+own+light+and+are+at+all+times+active,+because+they+do+not+alter+their+appearance+through+a+change+in+our+standpoint,+for+they+have+no+parallax.+Unlike+the+others,+they+do+not+belong+to+one+system+(nation)+alone,+but+to+the+world.+But+just+because+they+are+situated+so+high,+their+light+usually+requires+many+years+before+it+becomes+visible+to+the+inhabitants+of+earth.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=X9sdKDb2Ji&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U3w_Wil1YTochE-X7hyUbSBxxGvGw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi797am7LDxAhUS6p4KHVakA-8Q6AEwAHoECAIQAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuthors%20can%20be%20divided%20into%20meteors%2C%20planets%20and%20fixed%20stars.%20The%20meteors%20produce%20a%20loud%20momentary%20effect%3B%20we%20look%20up%2C%20shout%20'see%20there!'%20and%20then%20they%20are%20gone%20for%20ever.%20The%20planets%20and%20comets%20last%20for%20a%20much%20longer%20time....The%20fixed%20stars%20alone%20are%20constant%20and%20unalterable%3B%20their%20position%20in%20the%20firmament%20is%20fixed%3B%20they%20have%20their%20own%20light%20and%20are%20at%20all%20times%20active%2C%20because%20they%20do%20not%20alter%20their%20appearance%20through%20a%20change%20in%20our%20standpoint%2C%20for%20they%20have%20no%20parallax.%20Unlike%20the%20others%2C%20they%20do%20not%20belong%20to%20one%20system%20(nation)%20alone%2C%20but%20to%20the%20world.%20But%20just%20because%20they%20are%20situated%20so%20high%2C%20their%20light%20usually%20requires%20many%20years%20before%20it%20becomes%20visible%20to%20the%20inhabitants%20of%20earth.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;this quote&lt;/a&gt; from Arthur Schopenhauer (without naming him, likely because he was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#Women"&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;problematic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="M4bjVJ"&gt;Authors can be divided into meteors, planets and fixed stars. The meteors produce a loud momentary effect; we look up, shout ‘see there!’ and then they are gone for ever. The planets and comets last for a much longer time. ... The fixed stars alone are constant and unalterable; their position in the firmament is fixed; they have their own light and are at all times active, because they do not alter their appearance through a change in our standpoint, for they have no parallax. Unlike the others, they do not belong to one system (nation) alone, but to the world. But just because they are situated so high, their light usually requires many years before it becomes visible to the inhabitants of earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7o9BgT"&gt;That’s a long way of pointing out that despite the short-term incentives, Nadella is playing a very long game with Windows 11. Just as Google and Apple build their companies around their business models, so does Microsoft. But Microsoft’s business model has nothing to do with selling Windows or even getting a cut of app sales anymore. It’s about Microsoft 365, Azure, and enterprise services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpUYcC"&gt;When Nadella says Windows is “a platform for platform creators,” Microsoft’s other services are some of those other platforms — that happen to work well on Windows. For the time being, Nadella’s argument is that Windows 11 is big enough and broad enough to make room for others, too — and that other platforms are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o23hi7"&gt;Nadella’s full remarks are below. And just as this story was published, Nadella himself tweeted the core part of his speech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iTqga3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;p id="iZl0DE"&gt;I’m really excited to be here with you all. Today marks a major milestone in the history of Windows. It’s the beginning of a new generation. I’m excited by what we have shown you today and how we are reimagining everything from the operating system itself to the browser to the store and the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoeHzr"&gt;And I want to reflect briefly on how we got here. Throughout its history, Windows has been a democratizing force for the world. Windows has created entirely new categories for both consumers and businesses. It’s led to many of the world’s most successful software categories, from communications and productivity to design and business applications, each of which has created their own ecosystems. The web itself was born and grew up on Windows. It’s driven silicon innovation device innovation. It’s enabled so many people — including hobbyists, developers, and entrepreneurs — to all dream big; turn their ideas into reality; and monetize their creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sb7XW"&gt;Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvLovj"&gt;With Windows, you can consume apps and build apps. You can play games and design games. You can buy a PC and build a PC. You can join your community and create your community. You can buy from a business and start your own business. With Windows 11, we have a renewed sense of Windows’ role in the world. As I look ahead, I see three clear opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lsd463"&gt;First, Windows recognizes that there is no personal computing without personal agency. Personal computing requires choice, and we need to nurture and grow our own agency over computing itself. We want to remove the barriers that too often exist today and provide real choice and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roBAIJ"&gt;We need to be empowered to choose the applications we run, the content we consume, the people we connect to, and even how we allocate our own attention. Operating systems and devices should mold to our needs, not the other way around. That’s why we are making it easier for you to connect with the people you want, the content you want, the apps you want across all devices you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73wTi6"&gt;Second, Windows is the stage for the world’s creation. As a creator, every time you pick up a Windows device, it becomes a stage for your inspiration, so you can dream big and create something profound and lasting. Creation is going through a sea change as the balance between consumption and creation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Js77NO"&gt;With this new generation of Windows, we are unleashing the innovation and ingenuity inherent in each of us. We want to foster these virtuous loops between content, consumption, and commerce — driven by communities for everyone. These cycles should flow freely, giving people frictionless access to apps, files, games, movies, shows, content, and communities that matter to them. We want to empower you to produce and inspire you to create. It’s why we’re introducing a complete new user experience in helping you be more productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aoy8Q2"&gt;And finally, Windows isn’t just an operating system; it’s a platform for platform creators. It allows for the broadest of design spaces, enabling people to build their own businesses and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmCPfQ"&gt;Today, the world needs a more open platform, one that allows apps to become platforms in their own right. Windows is a platform where things that are bigger than Windows can be born, like the web. That’s our aspiration with Windows 11, to be the platform for the next web, the next transformational software category, the next personalized content business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNpAVy"&gt;A platform can only serve society if its rules allow for this foundational innovation and category creation. It’s why we’re introducing new store commerce models and policies, and creating new opportunities for local publishers, and supporting even more apps with Android apps on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SInLfo"&gt;This is the first version of a new era of Windows. We’re building for the next decade and beyond. And when I reflect on those chapters to come, I’m reminded of an analogy from a 19th century philosopher who compared creators to objects in our Solar System. He wrote about meteors that flash but fade away. Planets that burned longer, but whose energy is confined to their own orbit — and compared them to stars that are constant and light the path of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uer7Zd"&gt;That’s our ambition with Windows: to help other stars and entire constellations to be born and thrive. I am incredibly proud of what Windows has achieved and how it is fostered lasting opportunity for others. And I look forward to seeing what you achieve with Windows 11 and how it’ll unlock enduring opportunity for people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXmLFk"&gt;Thank you all very, very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Teamsters pass nationwide Amazon unionization campaign</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xffayK"&gt;The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is launching a nationwide campaign to unionize Amazon workers. On Thursday, the union &lt;a href="https://teamster.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/62421CONVENTIONRESOLUTIONAMAZON.pdf"&gt;passed a resolution&lt;/a&gt; to make the “Amazon Project” a top priority and said it would commit “all resources necessary” to making the initiative successful. News of the campaign &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg7pp/the-teamsters-announce-coordinated-nationwide-project-to-unionize-amazon"&gt;was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0fmfi"&gt;“Amazon presents a massive threat to working-class communities and good jobs in the logistics industry,” said Randy Korgan, national director of the Amazon Project, in a statement. “Amazon workers are calling for safer and better working conditions, and with today’s resolution, we are activating the full force of our union to support them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWI0qF"&gt;The vote came during the union’s annual convention on June 24th. Of the 1,632 delegates present, 1,562 voted to pass the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZNctt"&gt;As part of the initiative, the Teamsters will create a special Amazon Division tasked with “taking on the threat that is Amazon for the next five years.” It’s designed to help the Teamsters roll out a unified strategy across its 500 local unions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ai2UnB"&gt;Korgan told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; the union has been planning the campaign for years. “We’ve been working on this for quite some time—well before Bessemer broke out,” he said, referring to the recent union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y51vHP"&gt;In April, the National Labor Relations Board announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, had voted against unionizing&lt;/a&gt; with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The news came after months of Amazon’s brutal union-busting campaign, which included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;pressuring the postal service to install a mailbox&lt;/a&gt; outside the warehouse to collect ballots, which gave some workers the impression that Amazon controlled the vote. RWDSU challenged the results of the election in a complaint filed with the NLRB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJLWWW"&gt;“In my more than two decades of service as Teamsters General President, I’ve yet to see a threat quite like the one Amazon presents to hardworking people, small businesses, the logistics industry and our nation’s middle class,” said Teamsters president James P. Hoffa in a statement. “Our 1.4 million Teamster members, their families and communities stand together in solidarity with Amazon workers, and we commit our union’s full support as they build worker power for a better future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6lQFF"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9OcG1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwL4pt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything Microsoft is removing from Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ly7cIMG27qgyUcL6m3cRu9fu7O0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499920/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_9.54.09_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft announced Windows 11 on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ot9MNg"&gt;Microsoft just announced Windows 11, which brings a new design, a centered Start menu, the ability to run Android apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;and a whole lot more&lt;/a&gt;. But alongside everything new revealed on Thursday, Microsoft also shared details on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications"&gt;features that will be deprecated or removed&lt;/a&gt;, and you might want to check out what’s changing in case there’s anything you might have to adjust to in your day-to-day use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMPNka"&gt;Here are some big changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bpkmCR"&gt;Cortana is no longer part of the boot experience, and you can read my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548899/microsoft-windows-11-cortana-experience-taskbar"&gt;Monica Chin’s feels about that here&lt;/a&gt;. It also won’t be pinned to the taskbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dP9YNO"&gt;Live Tiles will no longer be available in the Start menu. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163687/microsoft-new-windows-10-start-menu-design-live-tiles-changes"&gt;had been exploring de-emphasizing them&lt;/a&gt;, but in Windows 11, they’ll officially be gone. Also, anything you’ve pinned to the Start menu won’t come along for the ride, and you can’t resize it — yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gp21ui"&gt;There’s no more tablet mode, and Windows 10’s lightweight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095424/microsoft-windows-10-s-mode-free-upgrades"&gt;S mode&lt;/a&gt; (arguably also handy for tablets) will only be available in Windows 11 Home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nUIhB2"&gt;Skype is one of a few apps that will no longer be included in clean installs of the new OS. The change, while major, isn’t too surprising, given that Teams will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;directly integrated as part of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yry5Wq"&gt;OneNote for Windows 10 also won’t be included in clean installs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Bs7lc"&gt;In addition, Microsoft is no longer including Paint 3D and 3D Viewer, which were important enough to be the focus of one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/11/15256214/microsoft-windows-10-creators-update-features-review"&gt;of the biggest Windows 10 updates&lt;/a&gt;, in clean installs. Microsoft has been moving in this direction already — the two apps weren’t included in fresh installs of a &lt;a href="https://mspoweruser.com/goodbye-creators-update-microsoft-removes-paint3d-and-3d-viewer-from-windows-10/"&gt;Windows 10 Insider build from March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qooSrD"&gt;All of those apps aren’t gone forever, though — you’ll still be able to download them from the Microsoft Store if you want. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ozZPur"&gt;You will no longer be able to pin the taskbar to any side of the screen — it can only be aligned to the bottom in Windows 11. Apps also can’t customize areas of the taskbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="77UQju"&gt;To see everything that’s changing, check out the full list &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications"&gt;on Microsoft’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
