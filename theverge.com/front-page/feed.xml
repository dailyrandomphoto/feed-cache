    <title>I hope to someday sit in Kohler’s new voice-activated smart bath</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYXC2L776lbS_A15s-S024WqUNA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637258/Kohler_aad32136_rgb_SM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Kohler&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbqLyy"&gt;Kohler has revealed a new smart bath that lets you use an app, or your voice, to fill up the water. That by itself seems pretty handy to me, but depending on which model you buy, you can elevate your bathing experience by changing the color of lights around the tub or even &lt;em&gt;adding some fog&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Noatfb"&gt;You’ll also be able to establish preset routines to turn on features in a certain order so you can set your bath exactly the way you want it. For example, you can have the tub fill itself up to a specified level and a certain temperature, and once that’s done, add some fog or turn on some aromatherapy, all with a voice command to Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrvHF6"&gt;Take look at the Stillness Bath for yourself in this footage provided by Kohler. I gotta say, it seems like a really relaxing tub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqbiGz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Kohler Broll|100112" data-volume-uuid="664865c9f" data-volume-id="100112" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-73" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ilmNEb"&gt;If you want this luxurious bath experience in your own home, though, it won’t come cheap. Just to control the temperature and depth of the water, you’re looking at a model with an estimated price of $8,698. If you want the “Experience Tower” that lets you activate fog and aromatherapy, that’ll cost around $10,998. Both of those models will be available in July. The version that also has floor grates for overflow and the lights has an estimated price of $15,998, and it will be available in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9v0kR4"&gt;While the Stillness Bath seems neat, I have to say that it isn’t quite as awe-inspiring as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170575/kohler-konnect-bathroom-smart-gadgets-numi-intelligent-toilet-ces-2019"&gt;Kohler’s Numi 2.0 Intelligent Toilet&lt;/a&gt;, which has surround sound speakers, ambient lighting, and Alexa voice controls. It earned &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18177016/verge-ces-2019-awards-best-tv-laptop-gaming-device"&gt;“Most CES” award&lt;/a&gt; for CES 2019. However, it appears you still can’t buy the toilet just yet — though you can sign up to be notified when it’s available on &lt;a href="https://www.smarthome.kohler.com/smart-intelligent-toilets-numi2"&gt;Kohler’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s Model Y now available in cheaper Standard Range option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jETDuW0U4O6O9hdmrYdKWZdYM4w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637201/msedge_LxyYS8lexd.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Standard Range model sits alongside the existing Long Range and Performance versions.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot:  Tesla.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CATuRF"&gt;Tesla is now taking orders for a cheaper &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#battery"&gt;Standard Range version of the Model Y&lt;/a&gt;. The new variant, whose availability was reported &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/07/tesla-model-y-standard-range-rwd-third-row-option/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has a cheaper starting price of $41,990 compared to $49,990 for the Long Range model. The discount comes with a lower EPA estimated range of 244 miles rather than 326 miles, and rear-wheel rather than all-wheel drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uu8DPv"&gt;Alongside the new cheaper Model Y version, Tesla is also selling a new 7-seat option for a $3,000 premium. The version has a third seating row, which can be folded flat along with the second row for cargo storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yfbPWP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Standard Range option was originally announced with a 230-mile range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aq2aok"&gt;Tesla originally announced the Standard Range version of the Model Y back at the car’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264446/tesla-model-y-suv-compact-announcement-price-release-date-features-elon-musk#g0UiFs:~:text=The%20cheaper%2C%20standard%20range%20version%20with,said.%20It%20will%20sell%20for%20%2439%2C000."&gt;announcement in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/tesla-march-event-28-1.jpg?resize=1536,857"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the company was targeting a release date of Spring 2021 for the entry-level Model Y with a 230-mile range and $39,000 price tag. However, in July last year, Musk said Tesla shelved its plans for the Standard Range model because its “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1282496094908243968"&gt;range would be unacceptably low&lt;/a&gt;” at under 250 miles. This new $41,990 Standard Range Model Y appears to be a compromise on the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfn25S"&gt;If you want to order the new variant, Tesla notes that estimated delivery times currently range from two to five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No headline can possibly do this photo justice</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4k1iNz2xeYKMM5W0MIZjA16oGQ=/101x76:845x572/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68636964/20210108_pokemon_genger_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwhelmed by life? Shove your head in a Gengar.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://p-bandai.jp/item/item-1000153723/" target="_blank"&gt;P-Bandai.jp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ukacdp"&gt;Pokémon has an illustrious history of beautifully bizarre merch including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556433/pokemon-pod-metapod-costume-pokeshopper"&gt;human-sized Metapod sleeping bag&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152607/ditto-pokemon-chair-price"&gt;Ditto chair&lt;/a&gt;, but this &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fp-bandai.jp%2Fitem%2Fitem-1000153723%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F1%2F8%2F22220219%2Fgengar-tongue-cushion-plushie-sleeping-bag-cocoon#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;giant Gengar plushie&lt;/a&gt; might be the best yet. It’s cute, sure, but it’s also incredibly practical. Just roll out its roughly 170cm-long tongue and you’ve got yourself a compact futon for sleeping on. There’s even a cozy little space in its open mouth for your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoXrYH"&gt;But this Gengar isn’t just a novelty mattress replacement. No, it’s capable of &lt;em&gt;so much more&lt;/em&gt;. Tired of reality? Shove your head in the Gengar’s mouth. Need an impromptu blanket? Use the Gengar’s tongue. When you’ve got a giant Gengar with a long-ass tongue, the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s 360-degree audio is coming to streaming video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ydRI0JLtuR_9qotUmzWvAZHlS1I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68636934/dseifert_191031_3770_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xzjvZx"&gt;Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/202101/21-001E/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; an expansion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915250/sony-360-reality-audio-release-date-amazon-partners"&gt;its 360 Reality Audio platform&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the 360-degree music format to more devices and media as well as offering new creation tools. 360 Reality Audio uses object-based spatial audio technology to place instruments or vocals around the listener’s head in a virtual sound field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf4Dqh"&gt;Now, Sony is expanding the audio tech into video. The company says it’s working with record labels and service providers to start streaming video content with 360 Reality Audio later this year, and the first example will be a &lt;a href="https://square.sony.com/ces2021/360RA"&gt;live performance&lt;/a&gt; from Sony-signed artist Zara Larsson next week. You’ll be able to watch through Sony’s Artist Connection mobile app at 5pm ET on January 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25lUNV"&gt;Sony is releasing two new 360 Reality Audio-compatible speakers this spring, the SRS-RA5000 and SRS-RA3000, although there isn’t much detail on either beyond support for Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant. Sony has also developed a new 3D audio plugin called the 360 Reality Audio Creative Suite, which is compatible with DAWs like Pro Tools and will be released at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8HTUG"&gt;There are currently around 4,000 songs available in 360 Reality Audio across services like Tidal and Deezer, Sony says. The format works with most regular headphones or compatible speakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s next Nest Hub could use radar to track your sleep, and I have questions  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFcEgN7UupmwA5VvET7OnRIT0jY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635781/dseifert_181018_3039_1267.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C3dtmd"&gt;Earlier this week, we reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213539/google-nest-hub-update-fcc-filing-soli-motion-sense-gestures"&gt;Google could be working on an updated Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; that had Soli technology, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/07/nest-hub-soli-sleep/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now suggests that it could be for something unexpected: sleep tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8AUsp"&gt;If you aren’t familiar, Soli is Google’s radar technology used to detect gestures and human presence. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer"&gt;first introduced in the Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt; (which was discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356745/google-pixel-4-xl-discontinued-out-of-stock"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt;), and while it isn’t in any of Google’s current Pixel devices, it’s now showing up in smart home devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;like the Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jyILr"&gt;So there is precedent for Google including the tech in its smart home devices. And the Nest Hub already looks a bit like an alarm clock, and because it doesn’t have a camera built-in, it may be more accepted into the bedroom for sleep tracking. But I still have a couple of questions about how it might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BzpDML"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a lot of ways having motion controls in an alarm clock makes sense.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFhuUt"&gt;As almost every sleep aid commercial points out, we all sleep differently. So far, Soli has been pretty short range, so what happens if you roll over to the other side of the bed? Is it going to lose track of you? What if you have a pet who likes to come and lay by (or on) your head? Will it start tracking their movement instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrisBH"&gt;There’s also the problem of nightstands. Those who do own nightstands may have them in totally different places in relation to where they sleep, and some may not have them at all. So far, Soli has only been used directionally, so it’s unclear how Google would handle having to deal with detecting movement and presence at a variety of angles and distances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWiQh3"&gt;Perhaps Google will surprise us and have this all figured out when they announce the product, or maybe sleep tracking will only work under certain circumstances. Despite my questions, though, I think there are a lot of other ways in which having motion controls in an alarm clock makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYAkfa"&gt;I’m not necessarily able to coherently speak when I first wake up, so being able to, as my coworker suggested, wildly wave my hand at the Nest Hub to turn off an alarm would be a neat trick. People who wake up to music could also wave to skip a song if the one that comes on isn’t how they want to start their day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqPxjk"&gt;If all this sounds intriguing to you, the &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;report says that the Soli-enabled Nest Hub should come at some point this year. The FCC filings that hit this week could also indicate that the product may be coming soon. While they don’t always guarantee that a product will be released, we do sometimes see them before official product announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC chairman Ajit Pai gave up on his legally dicey attempt to ‘clarify’ internet law</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkAMIQ"&gt;On October 15th, FCC chairman Ajit Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518097/fcc-social-media-censorship-moderation-ajit-pai-section-230-nypost-biden"&gt;promised that the FCC would “move forward with a rulemaking”&lt;/a&gt; to clarify the “meaning” of Section 230, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;the all-important internet law&lt;/a&gt; that protects free speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUkYGV"&gt;Apparently, Pai never got around to that — and less than three months later, he no longer plans to, either, explaining he’s short on time. “[T]here’s simply not sufficient time to complete the administrative steps necessary in order to resolve the rule-making. Given that reality, I do not believe it’s appropriate to move forward,” &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/ajit-pai-distancing-trump"&gt;he tells &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYZPQz"&gt;The reason he’s short on time is pretty simple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;he’s stepping down on January 20th&lt;/a&gt;, when Joe Biden becomes President of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79gM2W"&gt;But he might also be giving up because the idea that the FCC had the power to do such a thing was laughable. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21519337/section-230-trump-fcc-twitter-facebook-social-media-ajit-pai"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; explains in depth&lt;/a&gt;, the FCC’s justification was effectively that it has the power to make whatever rules it needs to make — which flies in the face of the logic Pai’s own FCC used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;kill net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. But that didn’t stop Pai from claiming the FCC did have the authority to do it, a political tactic that’s become so common in the Trump administration that my colleague Russell Brandom &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/russellbrandom/status/1346858060929785856"&gt;coined a phrase for it&lt;/a&gt;: “stunt legalism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez2Btg"&gt;Never mind that Section 230 isn’t actually that difficult to understand — though that admittedly &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210104/01172345990/60-minutes-episode-is-pure-misleading-moral-panic-about-section-230-blames-unrelated-issues-it.shtml"&gt;didn’t keep &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; from falling on its face&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Here’s our explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will remove videos of Trump inciting supporters to storm the Capitol</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eR0u1wlxMI_S0sfFMKd1ZLf3dgk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635555/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qRk7zR"&gt;TikTok will remove videos of President Trump’s speech inciting supporters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;to mob the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, saying they violate the company’s misinformation policy. TikTok will still let people post “counter speech” videos that dispute incorrect claims, however, and will let videos remain on the platform if they condemn violence or if they’re posted by news organizations. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/tiktok-bans-videos-of-trump-inciting-mob-blocks-stormthecapital-and-other-hashtags/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;the first to report the news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgW8gL"&gt;“Hateful behavior and violence have no place on TikTok,” the company said in a statement. “Content or accounts that seek to incite, glorify, or promote violence violate our Community Guidelines and will be removed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfnPDT"&gt;TikTok is also blocking certain hashtags related to the riots, such as #stormthecapitol and #patriotparty, like it did with other hashtags that represented election-related conspiracy theories &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551717/facebook-tiktok-block-election-conspiracy-theory-hashtags-twitter-monitoring"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;. If you try to search for one of these blocked hashtags, you’ll see a page that says the hashtag “may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Eh4wBvXBkcQF5qrluizrIZx16c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22221052/IMG_0144.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="709u3a"&gt;TikTok joins other social media platforms in restricting some content about Wednesday’s riots. Facebook committed to removing content supporting the storming of the Capitol or encouraged Wednesday’s events, among other measures in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/"&gt;blog that it posted Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. The company went a step further by banning Trump’s account “indefinitely” on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6noS7X"&gt;Twitter said it was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346926979505737729"&gt;taking action&lt;/a&gt; against tweets that violated its rules and that it was “significantly restricting engagement with Tweets labeled under our Civic Integrity Policy due to the risk of violence.” The company placed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;temporary lock&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s account on Wednesday evening and has threatened a permanent suspension if he violates its rules again. Trump returned to Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218794/trump-twitter-ban-lifted-unbanned-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Thursday evening&lt;/a&gt;, promising a smooth transition of power to the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump returns to Twitter and promises a smooth transition of power</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRutCc"&gt;Twitter has lifted its ban on President Donald Trump, and his latest tweet is very different than the ones we’ve seen for many months. Though he does not say he lost, his latest video feels like a concession speech. “Now that Congress has certified the results, a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,” he says. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.” Trump had issued a similar statement about “an orderly transition” this morning &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1347103015493361664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1347103015493361664%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2021%2F01%2F07%2Ftrump-says-there-will-be-an-orderly-transition-of-power.html"&gt;through a surrogate account&lt;/a&gt; — that of White House social media director Dan Scavino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ5NaA"&gt;The president’s own account was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;locked on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol, and Twitter said it would stay that way until he deleted several tweets and then waited 12 hours. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed Thursday morning that the tweets in question had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pgnNgK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/csX07ZVWGe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/csX07ZVWGe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1347334804052844550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8MDi"&gt;Trump returns to Twitter in a more tenuous position than ever before. The company said he’s now at risk of a permanent ban if he continues to violate Twitter rules around misinformation and incitement of violence. Once Trump leaves the White House on January 20th, he’ll also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;lose special “public interest” protections&lt;/a&gt; that applied to his account while he was in office, which could make it easier for the company to enforce its rules over Trump tweets that cross the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMVCua"&gt;Twitter banned Trump on Wednesday over a series of tweets spreading lies about the election outcome and a video the company said posed a “risk of violence.” In that video, Trump reiterated his false claims that the election was stolen, praised the mob that broke into the US Capitol, and told them it was time to “go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG88Ns"&gt;Facebook and YouTube removed the same video from Trump. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook later “indefinitely” banned Trump&lt;/a&gt; due to his use of the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,” saying the risks are “are simply too great” of allowing him to remain. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ban would remain in place at least through Inauguration Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbUNaU"&gt;Trump’s new video still includes misinformation, specifically a lie that he “immediately” deployed the National Guard to the Capitol. However, Twitter says that it won’t be placing a label on the tweet due to that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1347339743940419584"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;’ Ryan Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XeTwZ"&gt;Five people died during the Capitol riot, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel launches RealSense ID, facial recognition tech that uses the company’s depth-sensing cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPH8gx9cUApisoFJwtbcLxri3IM=/54x0:636x388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635336/Intel_RealSense_ID_2_690x388.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eCYa2C"&gt;Intel launched &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/introducing-intel-realsense-id-facial-authentication/#gs.px9cc8"&gt;RealSense ID&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, a facial recognition solution that relies on its RealSense depth-sensing technology (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/intel-pivots-its-realsense-cameras-into-facial-recognit-1845995990"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). RealSense started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/11/4719380/asus-dell-hp-and-lenovo-will-embed-motion-tracking-cameras-into"&gt;as a Kinect-style camera&lt;/a&gt; for touch-free interaction, but RealSense ID seems like Intel’s attempt to reposition its camera business towards secure, on-device facial recognition first, while also potentially putting the company in the crossfire of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtUkIk"&gt;RealSense ID builds on Intel’s depth-sensing technology with a neural network for identifying faces, a dedicated system-on-a-chip, and a secure element that encrypts and processes user data. The device should learn and adapt to a face over time, working around facial hair, a variety of different skin tones, and face masks, &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; writes. The tech is available on a module that can be integrated into other products or as a standalone peripheral that can be plugged into a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsTHRk2QnrXm8ZBUlwZdN9df8RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218622/Intel_RealSense_ID_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s RealSense ID.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aX52mu"&gt;Intel’s RealSense tech has been knocking around for several years, popping up in odd, tech demo use cases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724248/fallout-4-mod-uraniom-face-intel-realsense-ces-2016"&gt;inserting your face into Fallout 4&lt;/a&gt;, and more useful ones like unlocking a laptop with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8231993/windows-hello-windows-10-biometric-authentication"&gt;Windows Hello&lt;/a&gt;. Intel suggests this new application of RealSense could be used in a variety of settings, like ATMs, registers, and smart locks. What the company doesn’t mention is the other popular use of facial recognition: governments and law enforcement agencies tracking and profiling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv1GOF"&gt;Just in the last year, facial recognition software created by Huawei was used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163499/huawei-uighur-surveillance-facial-recognition-megvii-uyghur"&gt;to track the persecuted Uighur minority in China&lt;/a&gt;. And in the US this past summer, facial recognition tech was used by the New York City Police Department to track a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram"&gt;Black Lives Matter activist accused of assault&lt;/a&gt;. Intel says it processes facial recognition on-device, but it’s not clear how that would work to give you access to a bank’s ATMs or at cash registers. Beyond the potential for abuse, facial recognition software has been found to be biased for both race and gender, opening up the possibility for false positives. For example, a version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;Amazon’s facial recognition software Rekognition&lt;/a&gt;, had a harder time identifying people if they were female or dark-skinned than if they were white men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jpS0mh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reduced racial bias, perhaps?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjARNB"&gt;Intel has taken steps to address the potential for bias in RealSense ID by building out a more diverse sample of faces to train RealSense on. “We’ve done extensive data collection of all ethnicities from Asia, Europe, Middle East Africa,” Intel &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/06/intel-launches-realsense-id-for-on-device-facial-recognition/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at a press briefing for the new device. Intel says RealSense ID has one-in-a-million chance of falsely identifying someone, but we’ll have to wait and see if outside researchers find flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylo9id"&gt;Facial recognition isn’t the only future Intel imagines for RealSense. For this year’s digital CES, the company announced &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/turn-touch-interface-touchless-intel-realsense-tcs/#gs.q0dzl7"&gt;RealSense Touchless Control Software (TCS)&lt;/a&gt;, which uses Intel’s RealSense Depth Camera to allow you to interact with a touchscreen by hovering your finger over it, rather than touching it. Like facial recognition, the new application makes a lot of sense for a world still dealing with a pandemic, and shows there’s still some room for RealSense’s motion controller past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjWQ9B"&gt;Intel’s RealSense ID peripheral is available for pre-order now for $99, and the RealSense ID Module is available in a pack of 10 for $750. Intel plans to start shipping both in March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monster Hunter Rise looks like a strong Switch successor to World</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wc4vMYPbodb2LAwqWFvlPFUkaKg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635082/ErIsE26UcAExvdL.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zrRZLq"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt; was a huge success, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019"&gt;becoming one of Capcom’s bestselling games in history&lt;/a&gt; and exposing far more people to a series that had only ever been truly popular in Japan, it came at a cost. The move to modern console hardware meant &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; looked and played better than ever before, but it also meant leaving the series’s portable roots behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUgyrd"&gt;Even in Japan, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; only really took off when it came to the PSP, with people gathering in person to take down monsters together. It may not look like it, given its long, drawn-out combat system, but &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect portable game. You can do simple grinding on a quick commute while listening to podcasts, then tackle the major challenges when you’re with friends or have the ability to devote your attention to a high-ranked online quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZvj3x"&gt;If that’s sparking an inevitable “this-should-be-on-the-Switch” response, well, here’s &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;. This is an all-new entry in the series that takes much of what made &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; more accessible but puts it on even more flexible hardware. And very soon, you can check it out for yourself with a demo that should be going live on Nintendo’s eShop at some point today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5tIWEQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Monster Hunter World makes huge changes but keeps the series’s soul","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16591486/monster-hunter-world-preview-hands-on-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pdzRu6"&gt;Capcom provided me with an early version of the demo, and I’m pretty impressed so far. The demo includes two quests and a couple of training stages, which isn’t nearly enough to get a sense of the game’s scope or progression, but the fundamentals look to be very solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wBBU8"&gt;The biggest question I had was how much of a technical compromise &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; would be over &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, considering the Switch’s hardware limitations when compared to the PS4 and Xbox One. Of course, I expected &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; to fall somewhere between &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Generations Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/28/17790402/monster-hunter-generations-ultimate-nintendo-switch"&gt;a Switch version of a 3DS game&lt;/a&gt;. And from what I’ve seen from the demo, the visuals are much closer to &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, while the level complexity is more like the older games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDVTfj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; lifts &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;’s UI and art direction wholesale, with characters and monsters looking reasonably comparable in quality, at least on my Switch Lite’s screen. The resolution is crisp, and the frame rate holds up well enough. But the environment in the demo is much simpler and less visually impressive than anything in &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, even though it’s still a lot better-looking than &lt;em&gt;Generations Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;. There are also no loading screens between the numbered sub-areas, which makes for a big upgrade on pre-&lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; entries in the &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter &lt;/em&gt;series.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LLyzp8Pv9pKNedVramhzfC1__lg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219655/Eo_n51WXIAAwdyT.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOIAbQ"&gt;Otherwise, &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; appears to play pretty much like &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, with the requisite new features that accompany every &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; release. There’s a new tool called the Wirebug that’s like a more advanced version of the “clutch claw” grappling hook from &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;’s Iceborne expansion. You can ride a dog companion across the levels or even commandeer unwitting monsters that wander into your arena, setting them against your ultimate target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ7rlu"&gt;I’m looking forward to reviewing &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; in full ahead of its release on March 26th because the early signs are promising. The Switch is the ideal platform for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; in many ways, and Capcom seems to be going all-out in making &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; a first-class title in its own right rather than a compromised port. For anyone who’s been waiting for a new handheld &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, the news is looking good.&lt;/p&gt;
