    <title>The Lenovo Smart Clock 2 gives Google Assistant a new look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Smart Clock 2 seen from above on a white background. The screen displays the time 10:36." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gk4C5GPIjYyxbw8nnJdk-MD5Ru0=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512047/Lenovo_Smart_Clock_2_Birdeye_Clockfaces.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Smart Clock 2 in “heather grey.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z0MTG0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/8/21553993/lenovo-smart-clock-essential-smart-alarm-clock-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Smart Clock Essential&lt;/a&gt; are both functional, attractive alarm clocks with some extra smart home capabilities. Today, Lenovo has announced the next in line: the Lenovo Smart Clock 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJfA6C"&gt;The big news is that the Google Assistant-powered Smart Clock 2 can come with an optional wireless charging dock, which can juice up &lt;a href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products#Qi-Certified%20Product%20Database"&gt;Qi-compatible devices&lt;/a&gt;. This dock can also act as what Lenovo describes as “a soft, ambient nightlight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qp4qv"&gt;Beyond that, Lenovo says the new Smart Clock has an updated design with three color options that blend in with “nearly any home decor.” And 85 percent of the plastic on the device is made from recycled materials. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two Lenovo Smart Clocks, one facing the camera and one facing away from the camera, on a white background. The screen displays the time 10:09." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Bh6_l-zBseevkJa8e91tLBMdPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681432/Lenovo_Smart_Clock_2_7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in “abyss blue.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iGwh83"&gt;Compared to the $79.99 Smart Clock and the $49.95 Smart Clock Essential, the Smart Clock 2 certainly looks less... clocky. The device is taller, and there’s a bigger fabric chin below the four-inch touchscreen than we’ve seen on Lenovo’s previous models. To me, it looks more like a miniature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;smart display&lt;/a&gt; than an alarm clock, which is certainly a departure from the line’s previous design philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zC4GT8"&gt;The Smart Clock 2 starts at $89.99 and is expected to be available in September 2021. It replaces the original Lenovo Smart Clock, while the lower-cost Smart Clock Essential will continue to be sold. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Smart Clock on top of a wireless charger that charges a smart phone. The screen displays the time 10:36 on a blue background with clouds." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cgx0D9MwFzs6nHrK-zQHMN2Q1tQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681450/Lenovo_Smart_Clock_2_Birdeye_Clockfaces_Dock.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here it is in “shadow black” with the charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Y3so"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CLPJU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZkMUvv2TJUV9INCLobptUX5d9lI=/2x0:4499x2998/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/Samsung_Crystal_TU_7000_series_UHD_TV_Lifestyle_Image.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 55-inch Samsung Crystal TU-7000 is on sale at Best Buy for $450. | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with many summer sales in full swing, now might be the best time of the year (or, at least until the fall) to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zUfn7z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sFCZyo"&gt;Best budget 4K TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3C0Il4"&gt;Best OLED TVs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jVQclk"&gt;Best 4K TVs for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reasons. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J 4K TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-55-Class-KD55X80J-4K-Ultra-HD-LED-Smart-Google-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-HDR-X80J-Series-2021-model%2F919937738%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get it for around $750 (normally $950).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is available at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-55-6-Series-4K-UHD-Dolby-Vision-HDR-QLED-Roku-Smart-TV-55R635%2F796005169%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_yIDSdFQtCxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB14GwkExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1460806%26clickid%3DyIDSdFQtCxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB14GwkExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $789&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Dolby-Vision-QLED-Smart/dp/B0885F5GMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $900&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also pick up the 65- or 75-inch configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPfLVC"&gt;Samsung’s Crystal TU-7000 series line of TVs offers many features, such as multiple screen mirroring. Currently, the TU-7000 is available in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 43 all the way to 75 inches. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743619562269761088#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$450 at Best B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Crystal-TU-8000-Built/dp/B084JH43DJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;uy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9SocSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 55-inch 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Although its price isn’t as low as it was during Amazon Prime Day, you can still pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$390 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its typical sale price and $110 off the initial MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $430. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. You currently can get a 50-inch model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Toshiba-50LF621U21-50-inch-Vision/dp/B086VR2KY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $350 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687233984981481#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $350 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or a step up to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687411898346509#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $50 more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. Right now, you can get the 43-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$262 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is slightly cheaper than its usual sale price of $288.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 35,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch configuration and save up to $300, depending on the size. The popular &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555063-REG%2Flg_oled55bxpua_bxpua_55_class_hdr.html%2F%3Fap%3Dy%26ap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26smp%3Dy%26lsft%3DBI%253A514%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOgU3ox9wsfBFjLRJVHH3TWdndzXKhfL4blfPMcuIgQPfk8De4iHqNxoCh80QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model is currently $1,297 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and basically the same price at other major retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NqbUhw"&gt;The 2020 Sony A8H 4K OLED doesn’t support HDMI 2.1 or variable refresh rate — meaning it's not a great fit for next-gen gaming — but it’s hard to ignore given it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084KQFNBX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently $1,295 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Sony’s picture processing is as phenomenal as the OLED panel itself, and can bring out both natural colors and the blackest of blacks. It also supports AirPlay 2 and HomeKit, as well as Amazon Alexa and Android TV, the latter of which allows you to install and browse your favorite entertainment apps with ease. First-rate HDR performance, four HDMI ports with ARC support, a 120Hz refresh rate round out the A8H’s solid feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="buq7W8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733790"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9crrFX"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED is a Best Buy exclusive, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739879816744555003#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for $1,200&lt;/a&gt;. At this price, it’s one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a 55-inch TV. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvRhzP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,497 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for a few dollars more at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There are also 65- and 70-inch models available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can grab a 65-inch for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0817H41YN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $1,847 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $1,850 at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wy7BiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OGJPin"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GpBtSv"&gt;In March, NASA released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/11/22324870/nasa-perseverance-supercam-laser-strike-audio-recording-micrphone"&gt;audio of its Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt; firing lasers on the surface of Mars. Now China has released audio of what it says is its Zhurong rover arriving on the red planet and getting settled in, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/chinas-zhurong-rover-returns-landing-footage-and-sounds-from-mars/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. China has also released pictures of its Mars rover, which is unexpectedly cute as we saw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529603/china-cnsa-zhurong-rover-selfie-mars-perseverance"&gt;its first “selfie”&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRKEqY"&gt;Listen to what it sounds like as Zhurong rolls down the ramp of its lander vehicle on to the surface (but just to manage your expectations: you’re not going to hear any “pew pew pew” noises). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SfDRdh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Xa97M5nsWU?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=9&amp;amp;start=9" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lohqey"&gt;The solar-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;Zhurong first landed on Mars&lt;/a&gt; in May, part of China’s Tianwen-1 mission which arrived in Mars’ orbit in February. After descending from the Tianwen-1 orbiter above the planet’s surface, Zhurong began its Martian journey on Utopia Planitia, a smooth plain where NASA’s Viking 2 lander touched down in 1976. That’s more than 1,000 miles away from the Jezero Crater where the US rover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance touched down in February&lt;/a&gt;, however, so it’s not likely the two rovers will be hanging out together anytime soon. NASA’s Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012, was spotted by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/mars-rover-curiosity-on-mont-mercou-orbit-photo"&gt;climbing the planet’s Mont Mercou&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB2V2S"&gt;Zhurong, named for a Chinese god of fire, is almost halfway through its 90-day mission. But like &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/463600a"&gt;other rovers&lt;/a&gt; on the red planet, it could &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00575-2"&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt; to traverse Mars’ surface for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA6VZY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Harder They Fall, Ted Lasso, The Suicide Squad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwBR07XF1meccu6ml0OlduyE8yE=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510942/king_and_elba.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Regina King and Idris Elba in &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKz5kZr8mrg&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5eTIke"&gt;Since it was one of the top picks on Netflix and everyone’s talking about it, I started watching Manifest and got five episodes in before I realized it was basically a version of Lost with a few wacky twists and I am not falling for THAT again. But the deeply weird and wonderful &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is back, and the pilot had Christine Baranski and Audra McDonald at their best, so I can’t wait to see what happens this season (although we said goodbye to two of the show’s best characters, boo). Also can we talk about &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;? We probably can’t without giving away spoilers but episode three gave us a LOT, most of which I suspect were attempts at misdirection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQN1sH"&gt;I got so engrossed in writing last Sunday’s trailers post that I totally missed the new &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; trailer that dropped that day. Derp. Don’t worry, I’ve included it here (in case you haven’t already watched it 1,000 times like I have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OPphFJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKz5kZr8mrg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AUbM7U"&gt;The Harder They Fall &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iPeNzE"&gt;This trailer (sorry, it’s the official &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teaser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) for a Western about rival outlaw gangs opens with a train heist where Regina King and Lakeith Stanfield free Idris Elba from captivity— with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zWRjgathjA&amp;amp;ab_channel=gd73"&gt;“Let’s Start”&lt;/a&gt; by Fela Kuti playing — and then proceed to shoot their way out in slow-motion. It’s almost too much cool to take in all at once. Our plot: Outlaw Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) and his gang Stagecoach Mary (Zazie Beetz), Bill Pickett (Edi Gathegi), and Jim Beckwourth (RJ Cyler) are rivals of the newly-released Rufus Buck (Elba) and his crew, Treacherous Judy Smith (King), and Cherokee Bill (Stanfield). Delroy Lindo and Damon Wayans Jr., also star in &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;, (what a cast!) which is directed by Jeymes Samuel and is coming to Netflix soon (hurry up pls!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yRcGXN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reP1gVGpFKo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R4dHfK"&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RXhhjk"&gt;Ted unleashes his alter ego Led Tasso to be tough and mean to the floundering Richmond football club and it’s so goofy and ridiculous but so very &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; (lol he calls them “turd birds” what?). Jason Sudeikis and the rest of the crew are back in the second season, and we have less than a month to wait for new episodes, you guys (side note: you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543775/apple-tv-ted-lasso-merch-kit-jersey-trailer-season-2"&gt;buy Richmond jerseys&lt;/a&gt; at the Ted Lasso merch store). Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; premieres July 23rd on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3khcqb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eg5ciqQzmK0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="B9yc13"&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V7HVWx"&gt;Is Idris Elba in every movie coming out this summer? (for the record I am very OK with this). James Gunn’s take on the band of supervillains led by Elba as Bloodsport (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1407730256283193351"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; at last!) has them taking on even badder bad guys on a remote jungle island. Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Michael Rooker, Pete Davidson, Nathan Fillion, and John Cena also star in&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PKpjTu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YjFbMbfXaQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QJyLPV"&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HCs08s"&gt;We saw a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teaser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for this movie back in April, but this is the official &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trailer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and again, I don’t think there’s really much difference between teasers and trailers anymore, but I digress). Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi, trained as an assassin as a child, who is trying to escape to have a normal life. This latest movie in the Marvel cinematic universe has an almost entirely Asian cast, including its title character. And yes, the giant monster Shang-Chi is shown fighting in a cage match &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MCU_Direct/status/1408233747082878988?"&gt;looks to be Abomination&lt;/a&gt;. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Awkwafina also star in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters September 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7PAyF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKG0RodrzVo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EPVmei"&gt;Schmigadoon! &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCQ1aL"&gt;Keegan Michael Key and Cecily Strong play a couple trapped in a musical until they find true love. OK, sure, why not. This six-episode series has an all-star cast of musical talent, including Kristin Chenoweth, Alan Cummings, Fred Armisen, Jane Krakowski, and Martin Short. This feels like one of those flicks that is either going to be super funny or super cringe (although I did laugh at Strong’s character realizing that musicals kill people off all the time, so that’s a good sign). &lt;em&gt;Schmigadoon! &lt;/em&gt;(I’ll let them have the exclamation point) comes to Apple TV Plus on July 16th, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I00scW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked renders of Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 show four color options </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCMLh66kl6MC5vA3noHW2AMLBF8=/127x0:1074x631/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510367/samsung_galaxy_buds_2_render_feat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gomkgu"&gt;Leaked renders of the Galaxy Buds 2 obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/"&gt;gadget site&lt;em&gt; 91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the next iteration of Samsung’s earbuds will look pretty &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;similar to&lt;/a&gt; Google’s Pixel Buds. A May &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-buds-2-fcc-leak/"&gt;filing with the FCC&lt;/a&gt; showed the earbuds woud come in a white case with rounded edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmcV4k"&gt;The new images confirm &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/05/galaxy-buds-2-color-report/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt; that the buds will come in four different colors: black, green, purple, and white. The cases in the new renders show each will have a white exterior, while the internal color will match the buds. There aren’t a lot of other details available yet, including price, but the new renders show that the Galaxy Buds will have two microphones for improved noise reduction, and their in-ear design will include silicon tips, much like the Galaxy Buds Pro. According to &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;, the Galaxy Buds 2 aren’t expected to have active noise cancellation, but will have active noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WNi8eLwp2I1XVBMO78CrLXAP5Ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22684459/samsung_galaxy_buds_2_renders_09.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WtUU69"&gt;The FCC filing showed the Buds 2 with a charging case that holds a 500mAh battery, and each earbud will have a 60mAh battery. &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles &lt;/em&gt;speculates that Samsung may unveil the Galaxy Buds 2 at Mobile World Congress, which gets underway on June 28th, but also hold out the possibility that the buds will be revealed in August, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;Samsung may launch&lt;/a&gt; new Galaxy Z devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube reportedly took down videos by group documenting human rights abuses in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1F1aLPakXJdu5gT_KkNoMxoUvks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69510143/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="inZKkl"&gt;YouTube took down several videos from a human rights organization’s channel, which was attempting to document human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang province, for violating its anti-harassment policy, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-youtube-takes-down-xinjiang-videos-forces-rights-group-seek-2021-06-25/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJQvWt"&gt;On June 15th, Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights said the Google-owned video platform disabled its channel entirely, telling the group it had received too many strikes against its channel for videos where people displayed identification cards showing they were related to missing Xinjiang residents. That apparently broke YouTube’s rule against displaying personal information, which led to the videos’ removal. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5uns79sHr1AZiUw1ikV7PQ"&gt;The channel&lt;/a&gt; was restored three days later, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Iglq"&gt;YouTube reportedly asked Atajurt to cut out or conceal the IDs in the videos, but the channel’s administrator said  they didn’t want to do so out of concern that such action would damage its credibility. Atajurt has been praised by organizations including &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/21/silencing-activist-shows-kazakhstans-contempt-rights"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; for helping to expose human rights violations. According to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/24/1027048/youtube-xinjiang-censorship-human-rights-atajurt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Atajurt posts testimonies from the family members of people detained in Chinese internment camps in Xinjiang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9j5ec"&gt;Most of the videos that were removed have been restored following appeals, but some remained unviewable, and according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Atajurt is backing up its videos on blockchain-based video platform Odysee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yR2Upn"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Sunday, but told &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; that it welcomes “responsible efforts to document important human rights cases around the world.” YouTube has “strict policies that prohibit harassment... including doxing,” which is why it doesn’t allow personally identifiable information to be published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhMiCq"&gt;A June 10th &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/"&gt;report from Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; found that the Chinese government had conducted state-organized persecution, including torture, against people in Xinjiang provice in western China, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs. The United Nations has estimated that at least 1 million &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/22/china-rejects-uighurs-genocide-charge-invites-uns-rights-chief"&gt;Uyghurs are being held&lt;/a&gt; in internment camps in China, a claim that China has disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I75BZ5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XGr6m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC filing shows Verizon has built a smart display powered by Amazon’s Alexa </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWjuB7hdClKKJ9M-IahFNqXbg5I=/126x0:1248x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508856/verizon_display_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image of a smart display device from a patent application Verizon filed with the FCC | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzMYwW"&gt;According to a Friday filing with the Federal Communications Commission (first &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/verizon-smart-display-alexa"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Verizon is preparing to launch a smart display device based on the Alexa voice assistant. &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU"&gt;The FCC filing shows&lt;/a&gt; a basic-looking device that resembles an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;, with an 8-inch display and front-facing camera, and the specs show it has 4GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, Bluetooth, wi-fi and 4G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAXnhT"&gt;It’s not clear from the filing what the user interface will look like on its screen but the device, referred to as LVD1, will “wake” when users speak the phrase “Hi Verizon” to it. That would seem to confirm, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, that the device is part of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231336/amazon-alexa-auto-ai-custom-digital-assistants-car-makers"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows companies to build their own versions of Alexa for their branded devices. building Alexa skills specific to certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zvd4"&gt;A user manual included in the FCC filing indicates the device supports the BlueJeans videoconferencing platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223454/verizon-bluejeans-video-zoom-conferencing-rivals"&gt;Verizon acquired last April&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a logical use for it. At the time of the acquisition, Verizon said in a statement that “BlueJeans will be deeply integrated into Verizon’s 5G product roadmap, providing secure and real-time engagement solutions for high growth areas such as telemedicine, distance learning and field service work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pe3mo"&gt;Verizon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen plans to stop selling combustion engine vehicles in Europe by 2035</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="innDt7"&gt;Volkswagen plans to stop selling combustion engines in Europe by 2035, a board member told German newspaper &lt;em&gt;Muenchner Merkur  &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/vw-end-sales-combustion-engines-europe-by-2035-2021-06-26/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Lnb90"&gt;Klaus Zellmer, Volkswagen’s board member for sales, told the newspaper that the company would “exit the business with internal combustion engine cars in Europe between 2033 and 2035.” But, he added, it would take longer to stop selling combustion engines in the US and China— that will come “somewhate later,” he said— and in South America and Africa, where he said “it will take a good deal longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCpK1a"&gt;Zellmer said the automaker’s entire fleet will be carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest. He wants to see electric vehicles to account for 70 percent of the company’s total sales in Europe by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHgy1V"&gt;Volkswagen’s carbon-neutral targets are close to several competitors; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; will only sell electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and plans to spend $1 billion to convert its factory in Cologne, Germany, into an EV production line. And in April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;Honda said it plans&lt;/a&gt; to phase out gas-powered cars by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td3AC3"&gt;Several European countries have their own targets for banning traditional gas-powered vehicles, with Norway aiming for 2025 and France looking at 2040, and the UK planning &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54981425"&gt;on 2030&lt;/a&gt;. In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California plans&lt;/a&gt; to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, with several other states adopting California’s model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson settles opioid case with New York for $230 million</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5XARA0"&gt;Pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson will pay $230 million to settle an opioid lawsuit with the state of New York, the state’s attorney general said Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZyu5f"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-reaches-230-million-settlement-treatment-and-prevention"&gt;release from New York AG Letitia James&lt;/a&gt;, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson “has committed to ending the manufacture and sale of all opioids and opioid products for distribution in the state of New York, as well as to no longer ship these products anywhere within the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6mC6i"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-reaches-opioid-settlement-agreement-with-new-york-state-consistent-with-terms-of-previously-announced-broader-settlement-agreement-in-principle"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Saturday that it “made the business decision in 2020 to discontinue all of its prescription pain medications in the United States.” The settlement removes Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson from a trial &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-settles-new-york-opioid-case-for-230-million-11624716067?mod=hp_lead_pos1"&gt;scheduled to begin in New York on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, but not from other cases across the US, where local governments, states, and Native American tribes have sued pharmaceutical companies over the flow of opioids into their communities.  &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnsons-oklahoma-opioid-penalty-reduced-to-465-million-11573854343?mod=article_inline"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson was ordered to pay $465 million&lt;/a&gt; in an opioid case in Oklahoma in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ78bm"&gt; “Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson helped fuel this fire, but today they’re committing to leaving the opioid business — not only in New York, but across the entire country,” James said in a statement. “Opioids will no longer be manufactured or sold in the United States by J&amp;amp;J.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAqswQ"&gt;The drugmaker said in its statement Saturday that the settlement was not an admission of liability or wrongdoing, and is “consistent with the terms of the &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/statement-on-opioid-resolution"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; $5 billion all-in settlement agreement in principle for the resolution of opioid lawsuits and claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune release date has been delayed yet again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDDxOlU8K9y3bSKGxSlV4WQYVc0=/288x0:1574x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508062/chalamet.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9xhJrPXop4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures" target="_blank"&gt;WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwgNNr"&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;was among the big 2020 movies that saw its release date delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. After being moved to October 1st, Dune’s release has been pushed back yet again, this time to October 22nd, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dune-delayed-warner-bros-1235005456/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. The move was one of several releases Warner Bros. rescheduled, with the Clint Eastwood-directed &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924245/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cry Macho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; moved to September 17th, and &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110232/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, moved to October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHrZsV"&gt;The adaptation of the 1965 Frank Herbert sci-fi classic has an all-star cast that includes Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, and Javier Bardem. &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;is slated to be the first of two movies based on the book. The movie coming out in October (at this point, anyway) will cover the massive novel’s first half, while a second as-yet-unnamed movie is planned to cover the rest. There was also an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/6/10/18660412/dune-villenueve-dune-movie-streaming-show-sisterhood"&gt;HBO Max prequel series&lt;/a&gt; in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7OWyQi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9xhJrPXop4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mTD8H6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is among the upcoming Warner Bros. movies slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; at the same time it hits theaters. That controversial decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;announced by Warner Bros. in December&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t sit well with many in the industry including Villenueve. He blasted the studio’s then-parent company AT&amp;amp;T, saying in a &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that it had “hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T announced in May&lt;/a&gt; that it would spin off its WarnerMedia business to merge it with TV company Discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXBIwa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is still scheduled to have its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival in September.&lt;/p&gt;
