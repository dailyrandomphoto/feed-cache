    <title>Google gives Chrome users an easier way to sync info across devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELHcVs7SH1ZtVvfNrmnqHnXbPuk=/0x0:912x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483208/Image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature lets Android users sign into their Google Account on the browser with a single tap.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuWXnB"&gt;Google is making it easier for Chrome users to sync their passwords and payment information across devices, the company has announced &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/seamless-payments-and-password.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The new features will roll out “over the coming weeks and months,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FluKRU"&gt;Chrome on Android will be able to access saved payment information after you log into the browser with a Google Account. Payments can be confirmed by entering a card’s CVC or via biometric security. Logging into a Google Account in the first place on an Android device will also be simplified. If you’re already logged into a Google service like Gmail, the option will be given to sign into the browser with a Google Account on the device “with a single tap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQuWBh"&gt;Chrome’s desktop version is also being updated to give access to saved passwords if signed in with a Google Account. When you save a new password, Chrome will give the option to save it either on the device, or to a Google Account to have access across all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HmE6ayc1zUj4jZDL0EXc9eJ2kDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22156714/Image_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On desktop, you’ll have the option of saving passwords to the device, or to a Google Account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X9IMNt"&gt;Similar functionality is already available in Chrome via its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277"&gt;sync feature&lt;/a&gt;, which carries your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings across devices, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/08/chrome-sync-optional/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. But Google says the problem with this approach is that it relies on the sync option being turned on for each device. The new approach, signing into a browser with a Google Account, makes it “simpler and more intuitive” to access your information, the company claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7e1zj"&gt;These are just the latest changes Google is making to how information gets synced across devices. Last year, the company added the option to access &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2019/07/easier-payments-with-chrome.html"&gt;saved payment info on its desktop browser via Google Accounts&lt;/a&gt;, without having to turn on Chrome sync. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FireEye cybersecurity tools compromised in state-sponsored attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNOeA_nX_xxAqbPPaynZqLnjX1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483064/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ltEORH"&gt;One of the US’s leading cybersecurity firms, FireEye, &lt;a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s been hacked by a state-sponsored attacker. Hackers targeted and accessed the firm’s so-called Red Team tools, which it uses to test customer security and find vulnerabilities. Now there’s concern that the hackers could release these tools publicly or use them to attack others, though there is no evidence that this has happened yet. FireEye says that it does not believe any customer information was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD8hu9"&gt;Although the blog post, authored by FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, does not say who is responsible, it says that the attacking nation has “top-tier offensive capabilities.” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-cyber-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-breached-by-nation-state-hackers-11607461408?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Russia is a suspect, specifically its foreign-intelligence service known as the SVR. However, the investigation into who is responsible is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZqDbZg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This attack is different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sR207z"&gt;“This attack is different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years,” Mandia wrote in the post, noting that the attackers “are highly trained in operational security and executed with discipline and focus.” The disclosure did not say when the hack took place or when FireEye became aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xko0kr"&gt;“They operated clandestinely, using methods that counter security tools and forensic examination. They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past,” wrote Mandia. FireEye says it’s investigating the hack alongside the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as industry partners like Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzljPL"&gt;FireEye’s disclosure of the attack, which the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes caused its shares to drop around 7 percent in after-hours trading, was praised by US Senator Mark Warner, who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chairs the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus. “I applaud FireEye for quickly going public with this news, and I hope the company’s decision to disclose this intrusion serves as an example to others facing similar intrusions,” he said, adding that the attack “shows the difficulty of stopping determined nation-state hackers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8edIsL"&gt;In response to the attack, FireEye said it has developed over 300 countermeasures to help its customers and the cybersecurity community defend against the stolen tools. It’s implemented these countermeasures into its own security products, shared them with “colleagues in the security community,” and is &lt;a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/unauthorized-access-of-fireeye-red-team-tools.html"&gt;making them publicly available&lt;/a&gt;. FireEye intends to share further countermeasures as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom, murder hornets, Among Us, and Joe Biden topped Google trending searches in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A2GXCpsrz5xhz8e7tIsVacUUeI4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483016/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vk7wl0"&gt;Google has released its list of the top trending searches in the US for 2020, and as one might expect, “coronavirus,” “election results,” and “Zoom” led the way. To be clear: these aren’t top searches or most-searched topics. Rather, they’re “searches that had a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2020 as compared to 2019,” Google said. As year-in-review content goes, it’s pretty depressing; also among the top trending searches were Kobe Bryant, Naya Rivera, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406395/chadwick-boseman-death-cancer-black-panther-marvel-jackie-robinson"&gt;Chadwick Boseman&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom died in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qmrb04"&gt;Google’s top trending searches in news included “stimulus checks,” as the government’s distribution of $1,200 payments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222749/irs-coronavirus-get-my-payment-portal-payment-status-not-available-stimulus-explanation"&gt;didn’t exactly go smoothly&lt;/a&gt;; “unemployment,” as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html"&gt;millions lost their jobs &lt;/a&gt;due to pandemic lockdowns; “Australia fires” which, I have to be honest, I forgot was actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21048891/australia-wildfires-koalas-climate-change-bushfires-deaths-animals-damage"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;; “Super Tuesday”; and “Hurricane Laura.” Also among the top news results was the creature that should probably be the mascot for this hellscape of a year: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245617/tldr-murder-hornet-2020"&gt;“murder hornet.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFyjtP"&gt;The top people in Google’s trending searches included President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Kanye West, Tom Brady, Tom Hanks, and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eu65dH"&gt;All in all, it’s been a pretty terrible year, and the search topics mostly bear it out. But there were a few bright spots in the entertainment categories — and thank goodness for streaming services because we really needed the distraction while we were all locked down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYdvvJ"&gt;Under movies, the top trending searches were for Best Picture winner &lt;em&gt;Parasite, Black Panther, Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132868/harley-quinn-birds-of-prey-name-change-seo-warner-bros-opening-weekend-trailers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix dominated the top trending TV shows, which included the one we could not escape no matter how hard we tried: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202720/tiger-king-documentary-review-netflix-joe-exotic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; along with &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit, Cobra Kai, Outer Banks&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt; as well as Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188528/little-fires-everywhere-review-hulu-miniseries-race-kerry-washington-reese-witherspoon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBhgSZ"&gt;And under games, the little game that could from 2018, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, topped the 2020 list, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Valorant, The Last of Us 2&lt;/em&gt;, and, of course, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDXpnQ"&gt;There was also a “during coronavirus” trending search category; people wanted to know whether they could visit the dentist, buy a house, find a job, date, or get an Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAeZZW"&gt;So that’s what searches trended on Google in 2020, a year that felt decades long. Let’s meet back here next year, when, hopefully, things are looking a bit brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCnbvL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The hard-to-find PS5 and RTX 3090 have each inspired daring heists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FQxIVIRj8bFzMNFLuE_xBidDuk=/85x0:988x602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68482621/kNmhDjg.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dASHp9"&gt;The 2020 holiday shopping season has been defined by how difficult it is to purchase consoles like the PS5 and GPUs like the GeForce RTX 3090, prompting some people to use other, less legal methods to get both products. Bots account for some of the consoles up for resale, but theft is apparently another source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HJj54"&gt;Around $340,000 worth of GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs were stolen from MSI, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/MSI-nvidia-rtx-3090-stolen-china?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That amounts to 40 containers of the popular cards, based off the translation of an internal document from MSI embedded in the tweet below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QsIP10"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MSI Chinese mainland factory was stolen, stolen 40 boxes RTX3090, the total value of 2200000RMB ...... &lt;br&gt;MSI has been officially announced and informed to the police ,Reward of 100000 RMB for reporting effective information. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JWw8hOMioG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JWw8hOMioG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 夕惕若厉 (@GoFlying8) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoFlying8/status/1335856080711110658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0c5An"&gt;The GeForce RTX 3090 sits at the high end of of Nvidia’s line at $1,499, and often sells for hundreds of dollars more on eBay, which seems like enough motivation to steal them. What’s less clear is how these cards were stolen. &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; says that MSI’s communications cite video surveillance and inspections of each truck as the main security for GPUs shipping out of warehouses. This has led MSI to believe company “insiders” are the thieves, but there hasn’t been any information provided other than that document in the tweet, which is dated Friday, December 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lcLscl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCWNAJftXlg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WJiQKZ"&gt;On the PS5 side of things, thefts in the UK have involved a method that seems &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-07-gangs-are-hitting-lorries-on-the-run-to-steal-ps5s"&gt;far more dramatic and dangerous&lt;/a&gt;. In a maneuver&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Farticle%2Fgangs-rise-up-to-hit-lorries-on-run-0fhcw8hr9%3Fwgu%3D270525_54264_16074704053731_fd4b16de4c%26wgexpiry%3D1615246405%26utm_source%3Dplanit%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3D22278&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22164020%2Fthieves-ps5-rtx-3090-out-of-stock-reselling#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; refers to as a “rollover”&lt;/a&gt;, thieves use cars, one in front of a delivery truck and one behind, to slow down the truck from the front and open its back while standing on the hood of the car that’s following. This method reportedly requires some kind of insider information about what’s actually in a given truck, but &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;says it’s been used 27 times this year, increasing in frequency as holiday shipments have started to carry more and more expensive products. You can see an example of a “rollover” in a video from Romania above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z9KLHd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PS5&lt;/a&gt; day everyone. Tried to document our one’s unveiling, but Amazon have tricked us with an unsolicited air fryer instead (after giving delivery password). Anyone else had this problem today? &lt;a href="https://t.co/99IUSzSJUU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/99IUSzSJUU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bex April May (@bexlectric) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bexlectric/status/1329510558987644947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GE2VKF"&gt;In another likely theft, Amazon PS5 buyers received air fryers, cat litter and other household objects instead of the console. &lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;found a collection of customers who received a “PS5” box with resealed tape different from Amazon’s traditional Prime-branded black version. Conversations with current Amazon employees suggested that it would be very difficult to smuggle PS5s out of an Amazon warehouse, but it’s possible the consoles were switched out from the delivery trucks. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-continuingly-confusing-case-of-the-uks-missing-ps5s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;’s full odyssey is worth a read&lt;/a&gt;, but as of now, affected customers &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-missing-consoles-amazon-uk-new-stock"&gt;are receiving actual PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and the culprits remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2qyQU"&gt;Getting a PS5 or GeForce RTX card at this point requires dealing with prices higher than what both products retail for. Given that you can't just easily buy one at a store, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;the true prices&lt;/a&gt; aren’t $499 for a PS5 and $1,499 for a GeForce RTX 3090, but what they cost at resale. We saw average prices of the PS5 reach $1,024 and GeForce RTX 3090 averaging $2,076 when we last surveyed eBay. You can start to see why both products have become the targets of thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyVXS6"&gt;If there’s any lesson to be learned besides “don’t steal,” it’s that sellers and manufacturers need to offer ways to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;pre-orders and sales more fair&lt;/a&gt;. The pandemic has impacted the amount of consoles and graphics cards that can be safely manufactured, but creating scarcity with limited restocks only worsens the problem. Until there’s an easier method to guarantee a purchase, reselling, and the occasional theft that helps it happen, will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCO1O6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7QXQN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfZbAR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqzXjG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0kug0"&gt;Cloudflare is &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/"&gt;proposing a new DNS standard&lt;/a&gt; it developed with Apple that’s designed to help close a blindspot in my (and I’m sure many others’) internet privacy measures (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The protocol is called Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH), and it’s meant to help anonymize the information that’s sent before you even make it onto a website. Whether that will help you with your overall net privacy is something we’ll tackle in a second, but first, we need to understand how regular DNS works, and what Cloudflare has added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrIyJY"&gt;Basically, DNS lets us use the web without having to remember the IP address of every site we want to visit. While we humans can easily understand names like “theverge.com”, or “archive.org,” computers use IP addresses (like 207.241.224.2) to route their requests across the internet instead. This is where DNS comes in: when you type in a website’s name, your computer asks a DNS server (usually run by your ISP) to translate a name like “theverge.com” to the site’s actual IP. The DNS server will send it back, and your computer can load the site. (&lt;a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/05/a-cartoon-intro-to-dns-over-https/"&gt;There are WAY more steps in this process&lt;/a&gt;, but this basic flow is all we’ll need to know to understand ODoH.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZYFCp"&gt;If you’re concerned about privacy, you may have noticed that this system lets whoever runs the DNS server know about (and keep track of) every website you’re visiting. Usually, it’s your ISP running that server, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/3/15105582/trump-signs-internet-privacy-rule-reversal-fcc"&gt;there’s nothing stopping them&lt;/a&gt; from selling that data to advertisers. This is the problem Cloudflare and co are looking to solve with ODoH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzQ23c"&gt;The protocol works by introducing a proxy server between you and the DNS server. The proxy acts as a go-between, sending your requests to the DNS server, and delivering its responses back without ever letting it know who requested the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49Pnt"&gt;Just introducing a proxy server, though, is only moving the problem up one level: if it has the request, and also knows you sent it, what keeps it from making its own log of sites you visited? That’s where the “DNS over HTTPS” (DoH) part of ODoH comes in. DoH is a standard that’s been around for a couple years, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/"&gt;though it isn’t very widespread&lt;/a&gt;. It uses encryption to ensure that only the DNS server can read your requests. By using DoH, then routing it through a proxy server, you end up with a proxy server that can’t read the request, and a DNS server that can’t tell where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dgmI4K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Staying private online isn’t something you can achieve by setting up a single tool&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvCxC3"&gt;This leaves the question: Will all this actually protect your privacy? It does mean that the DNS server won’t be able to keep a log of which sites &lt;em&gt;you specifically&lt;/em&gt; are visiting, but if you’re hoping to hide your browsing information from your ISP, ODoH (or similar technologies, like DNSCrypt’s Anonymized DNS) probably won’t be enough. ISPs still route all your other traffic, so just hiding your DNS may not keep them from building a profile of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GApIX"&gt;The truth of the matter is that staying private online isn’t something you can achieve by setting up a single tool. It’s a lifestyle that honestly may be unobtainable in the real world (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1336373138871873537?s=21"&gt;at least for me&lt;/a&gt;). With that said, anonymizing your DNS requests is a brick to add to your privacy wall when the technology becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suiloG"&gt;Cloudflare has already added ability to take ODoH requests to their 1.1.1.1 DNS service, but you may have to wait until your browser or OS support it, which could take a while (DoH, for example, was ratified in 2018, and is only on by default &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/"&gt;in the US version of Firefox&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re anxious to use the new protocol, Firefox might be the one to watch for ODoH, too: its CTO says the team is “excited to see it starting to take off and are looking forward to experimenting with it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is officially launching fall 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qozT4rXW7wG-D93n3QbIy8sKGwI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481593/hi_multiplayer_map_2_1920x1080_4b85484a2b294c07951bec8b636d2270.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 343 Industries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwDPxX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, the next game in Microsoft’s iconic franchise, will officially launch in fall 2021, developer 343 Industries announced in a blog post &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-december-2020"&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgIZfY"&gt;The game was originally supposed to launch alongside the Xbox Series X / S in November, but it was delayed to 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; due in part to challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Microsoft hasn’t specified a month or day, this fall 2021 window could effectively mean that the game gets delayed as much as an entire year from its original release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1X3Vt"&gt;Microsoft did demo &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;July Xbox Series X games showcase&lt;/a&gt;, but received some criticism for the graphics and visuals shown during the demo (a dead-eyed enemy shown then even spawned the now-infamous &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/craig-from-halo-infinite-is-the-new-xbox-mascot-jokes-xbox-chief"&gt;Craig meme&lt;/a&gt;). In Tuesday’s blog post, 343 Industries said that it is working hard to “create the best-looking Halo game ever,” and spends some time delving into graphics specifically. According to creative director Joseph Staten, it’s already possible to play through the entire campaign, so much of the work remaining is polish, fixing bugs, and multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines offers at-home COVID tests for US travel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AVIATION-ACCIDENT-BOEING-AMERICANAIRLINES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdOZi-JJR8kyKCc2AuL-hb5UVk4=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481482/1229909022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by COOPER NEILL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M3FLzl"&gt;American Airlines is &lt;a href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Offers-Preflight-COVID-19-Testing-For-All-US-Destinations-with-Travel-Requirements-OPS-DIS-12/default.aspx"&gt;about to start offering at-home COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; to domestic fliers in order to help them meet various state travel restriction requirements, the company announced Tuesday. The airline is partnering with direct-to-consumer home testing company LetsGetChecked, which will sell the tests for $129 on top of the cost of travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkZ6a8"&gt;The at-home tests help travelers check off one of the most common travel restrictions that states have implemented, which is a negative test result either before departure or upon arrival. It will also help customers get reliable access to testing, which is still hit-or-miss in many parts of the United States. But there are still holes in the process; it is still possible to get infected on the way to or at the airport, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tgzRf"&gt;Different states also have different restrictions. Some states still require travelers to quarantine even with a negative test result. So American Airlines and LetsGetChecked are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.letsgetchecked.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Famerican-airlines%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22164032%2Famerican-airlines-home-covid-19-tests-domestic-flights-cost#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advising customers to make sure they know what’s required of them when they land&lt;/a&gt;. American Airlines previously offered at-home tests for travelers heading to international destinations with restrictions, like the United Kingdom, Belize, and Chile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tRj3NX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Receive a kit, swab your nose, send it back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bZ1lV3"&gt;LetsGetChecked’s test kits use a nasal swab, so customers will have to take a sample at home and send back through the mail (using UPS) to be run through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184015/coronavirus-testing-pcr-diagnostic-point-of-care-cdc-techonology"&gt;Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR, test&lt;/a&gt;. That whole process takes a few days, so LetsGetChecked says travelers should be sure to order their tests at least five days before their flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gPIka"&gt;American Airlines is the first to offer access to at-home testing for domestic flights. But other major airlines and airports have also been trying to introduce testing protocol as part of a way to encourage travelers to return to the skies. Delta Air Lines and Alitalia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721520/quarantine-flights-rome-fiumicino-airport-italy-us-delta-alitalia"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; they will test passengers multiple times on flights from New York’s JFK airport, New Jersey’s Newark Airport, and Georgia’s Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport to Rome’s Fiumicino airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELBzqw"&gt;Facing historic losses but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363675/delta-america-united-airlines-layoffs-cash-covid-19-losses-loans-cares-act"&gt;buoyed by billions of dollars in government aid&lt;/a&gt;, companies like American and Delta have been trying to resurrect the industry after the coronavirus pandemic devastated air travel earlier this year. The number of fliers did dramatically increase over the Thanksgiving holiday despite a sharp increase in case counts and warnings from the Centers for Disease Control, but it’s not yet clear whether people will remain as willing to fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeqkMq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUBdIH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 2 has gotten its last update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3Bbm49tan4sB3mVTYElmT9rD98=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481108/jbareham_171013_2050_0159.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were flawed-yet-likable devices with a camera that stood out from the competition | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wimsdZ"&gt;After three years of support, the Pixel 2 has received its last update from Google: a delayed November security patch going out to the devices this month, as &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/rip-pixel-2-google-rolls-out-its-final-update-phone"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&amp;amp;nexus_devices"&gt;device support schedule&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL aren’t guaranteed security updates after October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXne4T"&gt;Google announced the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL in October 2017. The two devices were identical in every way except size, and they earned plenty of praise for their somewhat groundbreaking camera. Google was early to really lean into camera software and computational photography, and the results showed in the Pixel 2 — its single rear-facing camera was in many ways ahead of the multi-camera-toting competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="09Ge0p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 2 review: plainly great","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16486108/google-pixel-2-xl-review-android-phone-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ddQoQO"&gt;Aside from a highly capable camera and an overall likable design, it wasn’t without its troubles. The Pixel 2 XL’s screen suffered some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16489756/google-pixel-2xl-awful-lg-oled-screen"&gt;well-documented woes&lt;/a&gt;, including a tendency toward a blue color cast when viewed at slightly off angles. Shortcomings aside, the 2 and 2 XL will be best remembered as the smartphones that put truly incredible image processing capabilities into your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fL7SfU"&gt;Nevertheless, time marches on, and current Pixel devices will see a December security patch arriving this week. The Pixel 3 and newer will also be receiving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158452/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-features"&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt; borrowed from recent devices, like adaptive sound and Extreme Battery Saver mode.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix wants to help parents connect with their kids by explaining what they’re watching</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wbOR3w5sWowhUq5l-p0iyDmOpYM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481072/Netflix_Kids_Activity_Report_3_phonesmockup.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="otJejR"&gt;Netflix is rolling out a new tool for parents to better understand and monitor what their kids are watching. Called the Kids Activity Report, as seen in the image above, the new breakdown includes data on what type of programming kids are spending the most time watching, who their favorite character is, and recommendations for new shows based on their interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utHhQY"&gt;Emails sent out to customers who have kids accounts enabled started going out this weekend, letting parents know they could opt into the report. The report also comes with a “joke of the day,” coloring pages (based on Netflix characters and shows) to print out for kids stuck at home, and prepared questions to ask their kids based on their favorite show or character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzcrCT"&gt;Parents will hopefully be able to better connect with their kids by having a more thorough understanding of what they’re watching — even if they don’t want to watch it themselves, Michelle Parsons, who leads Netflix’s product innovation team for kids and family, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNTkpbb5zpiwD4oRVxq_rNgV3ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155498/Netflix_Kids_Activity_Report_phonemockup.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DsvhcZ"&gt;“Most parents have a pulse on what their kids like, based on their Halloween costumes or toys they ask for at Christmas, but we don’t always know what those shows are about,” Parson said. “What is the show, in essence, talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LibQBG"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21211338/netflix-parent-controls-filter-movies-tv-shows-rating-pin-password"&gt;kids profiles&lt;/a&gt; are typically made for children between “pre-school and pre-teen” ages, Parsons said. If older kids don’t want their parents knowing what they’re watching — or just don’t like the idea of being monitored — that’s a conversation for families to have, Parsons added. Parents can opt out of the reports at any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHExGM"&gt;Alongside the new kids report, Netflix is also rolling out a global test for a Family Profile setting. Unlike regular profiles or kids-only profiles, family profiles will pull in TV shows and films that people can select as family-friendly, and it will appear in one profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG3l2k"&gt;Netflix accounts are designed around individual interests. The algorithm learns what people are into and suggests recommended programming to keep them glued to their screens. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Try &lt;em&gt;Cursed&lt;/em&gt;, or something along those lines. The family profile uses ratings to bring in a number of different titles that are then prioritized and recommended based on those individual interests. Movies up to a PG-13 rating and TV shows up to a TV-14 rating will appear. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AQtUNnKCGTsaoPFMQC9FZGU-VPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155491/Family_Profile_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgM0cc"&gt;“The key thing to understand is that it creates a family profile with co-viewing in mind that’s most relevant for specific family audiences,” Parsons said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VekCe"&gt;What people won’t be able to do right now, however, is add shows or movies in that are more mature than PG-13 or TV-14. Hypothetically, if a family wanted to watch &lt;em&gt;The Witcher &lt;/em&gt;together, that wouldn’t show up because of the rating. Parsons acknowledged that the team is communicating with members about what they want out of a family profile, and Netflix can work on a setting that allows subscribers to add titles beyond the PG-13 and TV-14 rating if that becomes a popular request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikoq58"&gt;The family profiles are rolling out today as part of a global test, while the kids activity report is also rolling out in select markets as part of a global test. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pornhub limits uploads and disables downloads after New York Times exposé</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Times Square billboard for PornHub from 2015&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hF1lBJ"&gt;Pornhub has made significant changes to its content policies after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; detailed the damage done by nonconsensual videos posted to the platform, often involving underage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCChq6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002934613"&gt;In a statement today&lt;/a&gt;, Pornhub announced a new set of policies aimed at keeping nonconsensual videos off the site. Most significantly, the platform will no longer accept uploads from unidentified users, a significant shift for a company that built its platform on non-professional uploads. In the short term, that will restrict uploads to content partners and members of the platform’s Model Program, although Pornhub plans to roll out a broader verification process for regular users in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dc7hRM"&gt;Once content has been uploaded, Pornhub will block downloading content entirely, no longer allowing users to export content from the site outside of paid downloads triggered through the company’s verified system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R12ych"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“these seem significant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zhk6it"&gt;PornHub has also pledged to increase moderation of content currently on the platform through a newly established “Red Team,” dedicated to “proactively sweeping content already uploaded for potential violations and identifying any breakdowns in the moderation process.” The company has also pledged to publish its first transparency report in 2021, detailing the results of moderation from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUbdyD"&gt;In its statement, Pornhub attributes the changes to an independent review launched in April, aimed at eliminating all illegal content from the platform. However, the move comes just four days after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;a searing &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from Nicholas Kristof, which triggered a significant backlash against the company and its practices. The report highlighted a number of young girls who appeared in videos uploaded to Pornhub without their consent. Even after the videos were flagged and removed, downloaded copies continued to circulate, often with severe and alarming personal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWXIny"&gt;In the wake of Kristof’s article, Pornhub’s business partners faced mounting pressure to cut ties with the platform — particularly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/visa-mastercard-pornhub.html"&gt;payment processors like Visa and Mastercard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M894pN"&gt;Dawn Hawkins, senior vice president and executive director of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, was outspoken in calling for the site to be shut down. “Companies like Visa and MasterCard who partner with Pornhub are also profiting from the rape of children,” Hawkins said in a statement after the piece was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeXlIS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/1336413019769856008"&gt;Reacting to the changes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Kristof seemed cautiously optimistic. “A great deal depends on how responsibly Pornhub implements these, and it hasn’t earned my trust at all, but these seem significant,” he wrote. “A great deal will also depend on whether past content, already on the site, is vetted or removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvsI69"&gt;Pornhub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
