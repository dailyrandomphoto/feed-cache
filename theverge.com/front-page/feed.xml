    <title>Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips arrive at CES 2022 for its most powerful laptops ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRAObyJLWmYK0-A8LQTmB148BQc=/140x0:3860x2480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346708/12th_gen_mobile_chip_pose_06_4000px.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hE1ibE"&gt;Intel has announced its latest 12th Gen Alder Lake featuring the company’s new hybrid architecture at CES 2022 with its first laptop chip using the new design, led by the Core i9-12900HK, which Intel boldly claims is “the fastest mobile processor. Ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RHbZ8"&gt;Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;first wave of 12th Gen Alder Lake&lt;/a&gt; chips on desktop last fall were one of its biggest successes in years, allowing the company to offer a chip that could beat or compete with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X flagship across productivity and gaming. And now, Intel is bringing that same new approach to chip design — with its Arm-esque performance and efficiency cores — to laptops, starting with its most powerful 45W H-series models of chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="M6MEGN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips usher in a new generation of x86 processors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QZt1vX"&gt;But the laptop world also has gotten a lot more crowded of late, with Intel not just having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD’s resurgent Ryzen chips&lt;/a&gt; to contend with, but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s superlative M1 MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; — including the recently released M1 Pro and M1 Max chips in the company’s 2021 MacBook Pro models, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;offered the best performance we’ve ever seen&lt;/a&gt; from any laptop &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al5atN"&gt;In other words: Intel has a lot of catching up to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MdswpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel has a lot of catching up to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7iKxOJ"&gt;The good news is that Intel is coming out swinging at CES 2022, making the bold claim that its new Alder Lake chips — and specifically, its flagship Core i9-12900HK design and its 5.0GHz boosted clock speed — can outclass both AMD’s Ryzen 5900HX and Apple’s M1 Max as the top laptop processor around, for both gaming or productivity tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmee39"&gt;Specifically, Intel boasts that the Core i9-12900HK offers up to 28 percent faster gaming over its predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;Core i9-11980HK&lt;/a&gt;, although the largest jumps are still in older titles like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Newer games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt; show far more modest generational improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrX8z0"&gt;The company also touts big jumps in productivity tasks, with a 44-percent boost in PugetBench for Premiere Pro benchmarks (a task in which Intel says its new chip also can outclass Apple’s M1 Max), along with significant gains in Autodesk benchmarks. Additionally, it’s important to note that Intel is focusing its improvements here primarily on performance improvements: the company isn’t boasting of any big jumps in battery life, an area in which Apple’s chips in particular tend to excel. (As an additional caveat, Intel says it conducted its tests on December 10th, before the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834232/adobe-photoshop-ipad-smudge-sponge-tools-premiere-pro-m1-macs"&gt;latest round of Adobe Premiere Pro updates&lt;/a&gt;, which added additional M1 Mac optimizations — so those numbers may shift a bit.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LbeawtTzLalfoZmDVJ-Fd_LXsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143548/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_8.52.24_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BWdkk2"&gt;Of course, all those benchmarks are from Intel, so we’ll have to wait until laptops featuring the new chips make their way out into the world so that we can put them through their paces to see if Intel really has retaken its mobile chip crown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpK8el"&gt;Like the Alder Lake desktop chips from last fall, the new laptop chips offer dramatically boosted core counts, split between Intel’s “performance core” for jobs that need the most processing power and “efficient” cores for less demanding or background tasks. Intel is releasing a variety of Alder Lake chips in this latest batch, spanning 14-core i9 and i7 models with six performance cores and eight efficient cores. Other less powerful i7 and i5 models drop those numbers considerably, though, down to eight total cores (four performance, four efficient) on the base i5 model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="amMw0d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10950021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd8jE0"&gt;In addition to the performance gains, the new 12th Gen chips also come with a variety of other improvements, including Wi-Fi 6E, Thunderbolt 4, PCIe 4.0, and support for the latest in memory standards (with support for DDR5 memory at up to 4,800MHz and LPDDR5 at up to 5,200MHz both offered). Notably missing, however, is integrated support for the latest in HDMI standards (Intel’s chip tops out at HDMI 2.0b) and PCIe 5.0 lanes (the latter of which Intel does offer on its desktop Alder Lake chips). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hD9PZI"&gt;It’s also important to note that Intel’s new mobile chips that it’s announcing at CES are just the first wave of laptop chips it’ll be offering in 2022 with its new hybrid architecture design. Today’s news is just focused on the company’s most powerful 45W H-series models of chips meant for gaming or high-performance productivity laptops. But Intel also has plans for 15W and 9W U-series chips designed for “modern thin and light” designs, along with a new P-series class of 28W chips also in the works that’ll utilize it’s P-core and E-core designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwsnPE"&gt;And while it’ll still be some time before those chips make their debut (right now, Intel is only saying that they’ll arrive later this year), the company has already released a look at the SKUs for the new Alder Lake-based P-series and U-series chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="chbdBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10960187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4sr8QO"&gt;The first H-series Alder Lake laptops are set to be announced at CES 2022 for an early 2022 release, while computers with the lower-powered P-series and U-series chips should be announced and released later on in the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel updates its Evo laptop standard for better video calls and foldable laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aw5Th0jJEAUZTmE1mBbnKSzANzA=/188x0:1964x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346707/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_9.09.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wh2a8s"&gt;Intel has announced its third-generation update for its “Intel Evo” certification program at CES 2022, adding new requirements for better video calls for future devices, expanding the certification to include larger and more powerful laptops, and new foldable designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4aUBA"&gt;The Evo branding (itself an extension of Intel’s original Project Athena program) was introduced in 2020 alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen Tiger Lake chips&lt;/a&gt; as a simple and easy way for customers to know that they’d be getting a laptop that checked certain basic performance and experiential metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7uFDp"&gt;Specifically, in addition to offering one of Intel’s 11th Gen U-series or Y-series chips, Evo-branded laptops had to get over nine hours of “real-world” battery life, wake from sleep in “less than a second,” offer fast charging (for at least four hours of charge in 30 minutes), and offer Wi-Fi 6 and Thunderbolt 4 support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDQeKEyzkDqH1TjvF9nlpDbcnnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143567/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_9.08.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ly68Ey"&gt;Naturally, with the recently announced 12th Gen Alder Lake chips, Intel is also updating the requirements for Evo approval: new Evo laptops will have to feature Intel’s new 12th Gen chips, of course, but there’s also a new “intelligent collaboration” requirement (in addition to the battery life, fast charging, and other existing specifications) to mandate high-quality videoconferencing experiences. As part of that, the new Intel Evo standard will mandate at least a 1080p webcam (if not better), along with Wi-Fi 6E and AI-based audio enhancement to cut down on background noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4bGS9"&gt;Additionally, Intel is expanding the kinds of laptops on which it’ll be offering its Evo branding. Laptops with the company’s more powerful H-series chips can now get Evo branding the first time, with a few added requirements on top of the existing Evo rules: namely, they’ll have to use Intel’s upcoming discrete Arc graphics (instead of, say, an Nvidia RTX GPU). Intel says that its goal is providing a great experience for content creators here — given the professional focus of the Evo branding (and the battery requirements), it’s unlikely that gaming PCs will sport the logo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DoOdrw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel will give foldables its Evo badge of approval this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZl66j"&gt;And in what’s perhaps the most interesting bit addition, Intel is also introducing a third category of Evo certification for foldable laptops. Here, too, device makers will have to adhere to the usual Evo spec list, with the obvious addition of a large, foldable display. The first Evo-approved foldables are set to hit the market in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRKzTV"&gt;Additionally, Intel announced that it’ll be expanding its Project Athena program to desktops, starting with its new wave of 12th Gen Alder Lake chips that the company announced at CES 2022. Unlike the Intel Evo program for laptops, though, Project Athena for desktops will focus on different experiential requirements, prioritizing things like privacy and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP updates its business-focused laptop lineup with Intel 12th-Gen Alder Lake CPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCT28LE9C1iG1utZXbo9yUZMS14=/0x303:3300x2503/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346717/HP_EliteBook_1040_G9_Front_Left.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The HP EliteBook 1040 G9 has a 14-inch IPS display. | Image by HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ix9QmF"&gt;HP debuted its new commercial laptops at CES 2022, including its convertible Elite x360 devices, EliteBook 800 and 600 lineups, as well as its ProBook 400 G9 series laptops. Each Windows 11 laptop comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;Intel’s 12th-Gen processor, which was just introduced&lt;/a&gt; last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewtkbg"&gt;The HP Elite x360 1040 G9 and HP EliteBook 1040 G9 have almost the same internals; one of the main differences is that the Elite x360 is a convertible device with a touchscreen, while the latter is just your typical clamshell laptop. Each device has a 14-inch 16:10 IPS display, supports up to 2TB of storage, and comes with optional 5G connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwtsKA"&gt;While the Elite x360 supports up to 16GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory and 2TB of storage, the EliteBook 1040 G9 comes with up to 64GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory. Both laptops also have a battery life of up to 13 hours, in addition to a 5MP camera and 940nm IR camera that should show you more clearly during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhRxA1ecmasEycJMm29uvcHoi_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142902/HP_EliteBook_840_G9_Front_Open.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP EliteBook 840 G9 laptop has a 14-inch display with up to 64GB of memory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ydsTPv"&gt;HP’s 800 EliteBook G9 Series devices — the 830, 840, and 860 — are ultra-thin laptops that come in varying sizes and specs, all of which come with the option for 5G connectivity. You can choose from a 13.3-inch, 14-inch, or 16-inch 16:10 anti-glare IPS display. The 840 and 860 have up to 64GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory, as opposed to up to 16GB in the 830. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj8kHW"&gt;HP says each device also lasts up to 14 hours on a single charge and comes with the Intel Evo stamp of approval. There’s also the option of the convertible Elite x360 830 G9 with a 13.3-inch display, in case you don’t want the traditional clamshell design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DYtMRzrySFE4nG0wDO1S_9IcLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142915/HP_EliteBook_630_G9_Front_Right.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The EliteBook 630 G9 laptop has a 13.3-inch display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wkisYA"&gt;The EliteBook 600 G9 Series includes the 630, 640, and 650 laptops, offering the option of either a 13.3-inch, 14-inch, or 15.6-inch 16:9 display. All the devices in the 600 series come with up to 64GB of DDR4 SDRAM memory and anywhere from 256GB to 1TB of storage, depending on the configuration you choose. However, only the 650 comes with an Integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics card or the optional Nvidia GeForce MX570.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uj4_Vnx-UHGoOsyvTK_oBgk7-5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142924/HP_ProBook_440_G9_Rear_Left.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Intel ProBook 440 G9 laptop comes with either an Intel Integrated graphics chip or Nvidia GeForce MX570.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jopk0S"&gt;There are only two laptops in HP’s ProBook 400 G9 Series, which Intel says are ideal for “growing” businesses: the 440 14-inch ProBook and 450 15.6-inch ProBook. Both devices support up to 32GB of DDR4 SDRAM memory and various storage options (with the highest option being 1TB) and come with either an Intel Integrated graphics card or Nvidia GeForce MX570.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieSIDb"&gt;HP’s latest lineup of commercial Intel-based laptops will be available in March of this year. Pricing information isn’t available for any of these products just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s upcoming Arc GPUs inch closer to their debut with latest OEM update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPWwmtqE39NiepZPDgq2ZLuL6vI=/1x0:1654x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346703/intelarc2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UxSPJ1"&gt;Intel’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;highly anticipated Arc GPUs&lt;/a&gt; have gotten a step closer to gamers’ hands: the company announced at CES 2022 that it’s already started shipping its first-generation Alchemist GPUs to OEM customers for desktop and laptop systems, including Acer, Asus, Clevo, Dell, Gigabyte, Haier, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, MSI, and NEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5UbCy"&gt;The Arc GPUs are a big deal for Intel, set to package the company’s new Xe graphics architecture into discrete laptop and desktop GPUs, marking the biggest foray yet for Intel (which is best known for its CPUs) into the graphics world. Arc GPUs promise support for high-level gaming and creative features, too, including hardware-accelerated ray tracing and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631061/intel-arc-gpu-alchemist-xe-ss-super-sampling-ai-architecture-day-preview"&gt;XeSS, Intel’s AI-accelerated supersampling&lt;/a&gt;. In short, Arc is Intel’s biggest effort yet to take on AMD and Nvidia’s GPU hegemony for both laptops and desktops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ih9XLb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel’s first Alchemist GPUs are almost here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7vx9Q"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s still no word on when exactly the first computers with Intel’s Arc GPUs will be shipping, either in pre-built OEM desktops and laptops or for customers to buy on their own and integrate into their existing gaming rigs. Similarly, there’s no official word yet on crucial details like how many different models of Alchemist GPUs there will be, what the actual specs on the graphics cards are, or — most importantly — how much they’ll cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvZjsI"&gt;Intel also announced at CES 2022 that discrete Arc GPUs will be required on Intel Evo-branded laptops featuring its new 12th Gen H-series chips, so it’s likely that we’ll start to see at least mobile versions of the new graphics systems make their way out in the world in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkapL2"&gt;Mobileye, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Intel, and Geely, China’s largest automaker, are joining forces to develop a consumer-ready autonomous vehicle that they claim will be ready by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLQ9ao"&gt;The self-driving car, which will also be battery-electric, will be produced under Geely’s Zeekr brand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346358/geely-electric-vehicle-brand-zeekr-china"&gt;which was unveiled last year&lt;/a&gt; as the automaker’s “new electric mobility technology and solutions company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITK6cL"&gt;The new car will be equipped with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, meaning it will handle 100 percent of the driving tasks under certain conditions, like favorable weather or within certain geographic limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI2k4G"&gt;The vehicle will operate with a number of Mobileye’s branded AV systems, including six of the company’s EyeQ5 System-on-a-chips and its Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="33i3fr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To date, there are no self-driving cars for sale to consumers as personally owned vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3YZPKZ"&gt;The vehicle will be built on Geely’s open-source Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), which includes redundant systems for braking, steering, and power. Mobileye, which is based in Israel, also plans on growing its presence in China by hiring more employees and building a data center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhppUr"&gt;To date, there are no self-driving cars for sale to consumers as personally owned vehicles. Most AV companies are choosing to deploy their vehicles as part of fleets of autonomous taxis as a way to defray the enormous hardware and software costs associated with highly automated driving. Other companies, like Tesla, claim their vehicles are “self-driving,” but in reality, they are only equipped with Level 2 advanced driver assist systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0TRFN"&gt;Most experts assume that autonomous vehicles will eventually be sold to consumers but at a much later date, when the manufacturing costs have declined and the margins are more favorable to a company’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAZjqd"&gt;But Mobileye and Geely believe that date is coming sooner than most people anticipate. The companies claim their vehicle will go on sale in China in 2024, making it the world’s first Level 4-capable vehicle available to consumers. They also hope to introduce it to other global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJc4Xs"&gt;Mobileye isn’t the only AV company to team up with Geely, which also owns Volvo and the new electric subbrand, Polestar. Last week, Alphabet’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858144/waymo-geely-partnership-all-electric-self-driving-minivans-zeekr"&gt;Waymo said it would work with the Chinese auto giant&lt;/a&gt; on a fleet of electric robotaxis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHnEXZ"&gt;Waymo has also partnered with Stellantis and Jaguar Land Rover to deploy and develop its autonomous capabilities, while Geely plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708804/volvo-ipo-value-geely-polestar-electric-cars"&gt;take Volvo public&lt;/a&gt; as an all-electric company, after doing the same with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;new Polestar brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG83lO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93CB9x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel announces 22 more 12th Gen CPUs for mainstream consumer desktops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejcrDyj9maynhRAa9IHcZgIb3-c=/314x0:2462x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346713/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.51.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbbjsB"&gt;At CES 2022, Intel is announcing the rest of its Alder Lake desktop lineup: 22 new chips, spanning the $489 Core i9-12900 to the $42 Celeron G6900, designed for mainstream desktops, all-in-ones, and other PC designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QGpOj"&gt;Now, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; launched for desktops last fall&lt;/a&gt;, but the lineup then was pretty limited: just six chips (three, if you don’t count the variants without GPUs as separate models), almost entirely focused for pricey, high-powered gaming setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VUUfz"&gt;Admittedly, there’s a fair amount of duplication here. A lot of the new chips — like the top-of-the-line Core i9-12900 — are extremely similar to the first wave of unlocked chips Intel already released last fall, albeit with lower power demands (the new wave of chips largely runs at 65W) and without the option for overclocking. Additionally, Intel is also releasing its usual “F-series” variants that lack integrated graphics, along with low-power 35W “T-series” versions of most of its chips. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/URfzzpa5pB7Vbd_JoY6tpCAX3Ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144176/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.11.53_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JubO-O2FqiGxo_eOtCZSxzUbr08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144175/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.12.01_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s 35W T-series Alder Lake desktop chops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rJph8K"&gt;As with their more powerful counterparts, the new Alder Lake chips feature the same hybrid architecture design that Intel introduced last year, offering a mix of performance and efficient cores (how many depends on the specific chip) to maximize power and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpiKSP"&gt;Along with the new chips, Intel is also expanding its ecosystem of motherboards and coolers to go with it. On the motherboard side, there are three new consumer-focused SKUs for its 600 series chipset: the H670, B660, and H610, which join the top-of-the-line Z690 boards. The new models are less feature packed than the Z690, offering fewer PCIe lanes and USB ports but still support major new features like Wi-Fi 6E and PCIe 4.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGe6Dc"&gt;Intel also has a trio of new coolers that it’ll be bundling in with the more powerful 65W versions of its chips: the Intel Laminar RH1, which has RGB lighting and will be included with the i9 models; the Intel Laminar RM1, for the Core i7, Core i5, and Core i3 chips; and the Intel Laminar RS1 for Pentium and Celeron chips. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DFR2vsNVJr-tkGxrhhdHy57I5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144232/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_9.10.57_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pXHF18"&gt;The new 65W and 35W 12th Gen Alder Lake chips for desktops are available starting today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP adds two new Dragonfly models to its business lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Eite Dragonfly G3 seen from above on a marble table. The screen displays a multicolor background. To the left is an open notebook with a pen on top. To the right are two cups and a phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGYB3dytoY7uTKoqrx0igeOGKBU=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346712/3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pretty fly.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A76KBe"&gt;HP will release business laptops of all shapes and sizes this year, but the ones the C-suite will likely have their eyes on are members of the Elite Dragonfly line. If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;its predecessors&lt;/a&gt; are anything to go by, the Elite Dragonfly G3 will be a light, powerful, beautiful, and undoubtedly expensive Windows PC. The HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, more intriguingly, will bring a Chrome OS platform to the line for the first time. That could be the premium, well-built device for which Chrome OS fans in the business sphere have been waiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFZiFt"&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook features a haptic trackpad (the first one we’ve seen on a Chromebook to date), a fingerprint sensor, and a Sure View Reflect privacy screen. For a better conference call experience, the device includes “AI-enhanced video and audio.” These features are all staples of the Dragonfly line but rarities in the Chromebook space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oqVYG"&gt;You can configure the Dragonfly Chromebook with up to 512GB of storage and 32GB of RAM. It includes 12th Gen Intel processors and will be the first Chromebook to support Intel’s vPro platform. The battery is 51Whr, and HP claims it can charge up to 90 percent in 90 minutes, which would be fast for a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A worker uses the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook in a cafe setting." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KReHQP0c34v83OiirzcgdKLwtao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144523/2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the Dragonfly Chromebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AQsSxi"&gt;The Dragonfly G3 doesn’t look too different from the Dragonfly Gen 2. The most exciting change is that it’s finally abandoned the 16:9 aspect ratio in favor of a 3:2 display. (The Chromebook mentioned above sticks with a 16:9 display.) More vertical space, hooray! Also interesting to note is that HP appears to have abandoned the convertible form factor — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;the Gen 2 was a 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;, but the Gen 3 is a clamshell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NE6iO"&gt;Like its Chromebook sibling, the G3 includes AI features for conference calls (including an “appearance filter” to tweak your video feed and noise reduction that’s supposed to help mitigate muffling from a mask) and has been bumped up to 12th Gen Intel processors that support the vPro platform. It includes up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, as well as a 68Wh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three workers converse in an office. One uses the HP Elite Dragonfly G3." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXUwCOP9nje0OOR_R8elhXerrxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144538/1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fly for the boardroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Swdvdf"&gt;Last year’s Elite Dragonfly laptops were really the best of the best. The Dragonfly Max was one of the most beautiful devices I tested last year and would absolutely be my laptop of choice — except that it was way too expensive to be a realistic purchase for most people. Hopefully the addition of a Chromebook to the line will help bring the Dragonfly’s exceptional build and state-of-the-art security and AI features to a more accessible price point. It may also be a good option for workers who prefer Chrome OS to Windows but haven’t yet had an option with the security and stability their jobs require. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yf7Hj2"&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is expected to be available in March, while the Chromebooks are coming in April. Pricing has not been announced for either — but I think it’s safe to assume they won’t be cheap. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Death Stranding Director’s Cut is coming to PC this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bvXoEBJPtr8JE5FncCwpSOhs4Hk=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346704/51298386042_570941bddd_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BheZTm"&gt;The director’s cut for &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PC, following its release on PS5 a handful of months ago. It’ll launch simultaneously on Steam and the Epic Games Store this spring, so you won’t have to wait long. Kojima Productions timed up this announcement to coincide with Intel showing off its new Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) graphics tech, a machine learning tech that claims to boost performance and elevate visual fidelity, similar to Nvidia’s DLSS tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dts59Z"&gt;In terms of the content arriving in the director’s cut on PC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696322/death-stranding-directors-cut-ps5-kojima-3d-audio-dualsense"&gt;it’s likely a match to what PS5 owners received&lt;/a&gt;. Publisher 505 Games shared that the director’s cut on PC will bring photo mode and ultrawide monitor support to the game, though the standard version of the game already has those features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAAM6H"&gt;We’ll likely find out more about the director’s cut soon, including details on any upgrade path for current owners (if one exists) and the price for people jumping in for the first time. You’ll be able to wishlist &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on Steam &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This breathing PC case looks like it’s alive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NpfFgPYc6jXvR8PSwKovET2fWsw=/0x34:3200x2167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346679/Kinetic_main_1A.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uVJkPV"&gt;I’m a sucker for RGB fans in my PC, but CyberPowerPC’s new PC case goes one step further to turn a typical tower into a breathing computer. It has 18 mechanical vents that automatically open and close when your PC needs some more air, and it looks like something you’d expect to find in a video game like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;. It’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cool-looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtHxVh"&gt;It works by reading sensors for your PC temperature every five seconds, and it will open and close different vents accordingly. If you’re just watching YouTube videos, or your PC is idle, then the vents will stay closed, but the vents will gradually open as the temperature increases. If you’re running the latest game at max settings, then expect the vents to be fully open to suck in as much air as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEOBwCzQBXmU3Z1QPwXwxcvocuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144814/cyberpowerpcbreathing.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CyberPowerPC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberPowerPC’s breathing PC case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9HUmr5"&gt;It’s extremely unusual, as &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/562598/cyberpowers-new-breathing-kinetic-pc-looks-insane.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, but I absolutely love its purposeful design. It’s inspired by buildings like the Al Bahr Towers that have a computerized dynamic façade, sunshades, or even modern satellites that expand and collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZNvwG"&gt;“These adjustments are not limited to a simple open and close, but rather the opening and adjusting real time to every single degree of temperature change,” says CyberPowerPC’s Nam Hoang in a video for the PC case. “It senses the environment and is constantly contracting and expanding to adapt to the situation with micro-adjustments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wZCSM"&gt;CyberPowerPC has been working on this design for more than six months, and Hoang admits the case “isn’t about maximum airflow, but intelligent airflow.” &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/562598/cyberpowers-new-breathing-kinetic-pc-looks-insane.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the case will first be available in CyberPowerPC’s Kinetic Series of PCs later this year and that the company is considering selling the case on its own for around $250 if there’s sufficient demand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s X14 is its first 14-inch gaming laptop since the Windows 8 era</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware X14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDMo0GWJ0fNADd541bbXGtAZQkk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346640/cfaulkner_141231_4943_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tM8KQN"&gt;For CES 2022, Alienware is updating the specs in its X- and M-series laptops, but the company is also introducing an all-new laptop called the X14. It’s a 14-inch gaming laptop that fits right in with the X15 and X17 in terms of design, though obviously, it’s made for people who don’t want to lug around a hefty machine. It’s about four pounds, compared to the X15 that starts at around five pounds. This puts it at a similar weight to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Razer’s Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bPzUl"&gt;The X14 starts at $1,799.99, which is by no means affordable, but you’re getting some capable specs in this 14-inch laptop. It has Intel’s latest 12th Gen processors (up to the Core i7-12900H), up to the Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics (the X14’s RTX 3060 yields a total graphics power of 85W once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;the laptop’s dynamic boost feature kicks in&lt;/a&gt;), and DDR5 RAM clocked at 5,200MHz — that’s much faster than what’s currently available in most gaming laptops. The X15 and X17 for 2022 also support up 5,200MHz RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZAvL23MwLRkXsoI1CxsgQL-jq5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120513/cfaulkner_141231_4943_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the X14 sitting atop the X15. Cute, no?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TLQ07X"&gt;The RAM can’t be added or changed post-purchase, as Alienware is soldering it to the board. Though, the single M.2 slot can be swapped with up to a 2TB M.2 SSD, if you want to upgrade down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1doRI"&gt;Alienware is touting that the X14’s 14.5mm-thick chassis is the thinnest 14-inch gaming laptop in existence and that it’s the only laptop of this size to feature both an Nvidia G-Sync display and Nvidia’s Advanced Optimus feature. That allows the laptop to automatically run off the dedicated GPU for more power or scale back and work with the integrated graphics for better battery performance. The X14’s 80Wh battery may deliver better-than-expected results for a gaming laptop, but Alienware didn’t have a battery life claim to share in time for CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another shot of the X14 showing off just how tiny it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WmUFhp"&gt;Alienware hopes to release the X14 in early 2022, and we’ll be sure to compare it to other 14-inch gaming laptops during our testing. It’s a surprisingly competitive space, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702219/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2021-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;, the Razer Blade 14, and others, so I’m curious to see how it stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;
