    <title>Server glitch allowed Eufy owners to see through other homes’ cameras </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CM2d1sAUqObuTp1q-fCWuu-oUrI=/60x0:675x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299620/evercam_eufy_4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eufy’s home security camera | Image: Anker / Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHzHSV"&gt;Last night, a number of Eufy home security camera owners discovered they were able to access smart camera feeds and saved videos from users they had never met, due to an apparent security glitch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/huge-eufy-privacy-breach/"&gt;First reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the issue came to light in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/neayuo/access_to_random_cameras_in_another_country/"&gt;an extended Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, in which users from around the world detailed their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H76KJQ"&gt;“Basically I could see every camera, their front door and backdoor bells, master bedroom, living room, garage, kitchen, their motion recordings, everything,” one Eufy owner noted. “I was wondering what was going on as it still had my email and name as signed in and noticed that some unknown email, I’m guessing of the Hawaii owner, was in my shared guest account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcpiqH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For a security product to become completely unsecure, it’s pretty worrying”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K2aABH"&gt;Some reported that signing out of their account and signing back in resolved the behavior; by now, whatever problem caused the behavior appears to have been fixed. Still, many users are left concerned that their own cameras and feeds might have been exposed without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDLpEV"&gt;“For a security product to become completely unsecure, it’s pretty worrying,” the users continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3igQsA"&gt;Eufy did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/journeydan/status/1394342460394987522"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the problem lasted only an hour and did not affect baby monitor products. On Reddit, users higlighted a message sent to customers attributing the issue to a server error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nOEmmZ"&gt;Dear user, &lt;br&gt;The issue was due to a bug in one of our servers. This was quickly resolved by our engineering team and our customer service team will continue to assist those affected. We recommend all users to: &lt;br&gt;1.Please unplug and then reconnect the home base. &lt;br&gt;2.Log out of the eufy security app and log in again. &lt;br&gt;Contact &lt;a href="mailto:support@eufylife.com"&gt;support@eufylife.com&lt;/a&gt; for enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3noul8"&gt;There’s no indication that specific individuals were targeted as part of the bug, but it’s still a troubling behavior for a service that often monitors private homes. Eufy also makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16308470/eufy-genie-amazon-alexa-review"&gt;an Echo Dot-style voice assistant called the Genie&lt;/a&gt;, although Genie products appear to have been unaffected by the bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAfroF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:54PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Eufy statement to &lt;/em&gt;Android Police&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Phone app can now announce who’s calling when the phone rings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bG99qIER1grtTGL-hNvbWMfIxf8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299471/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7banju"&gt;Google is rolling out a new feature for the Google Phone app that announces who’s calling when the phone rings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/17/google-phone-gains-caller-id-announcement-feature-to-help-you-manually-screen-calls/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s rolled out to you, you can set whether you want the app to announce caller ID every time the phone rings, only when you’re wearing a headset, or never, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyJmwN"&gt;iOS has had a feature like this for some time, and it seems like Google’s version for the Phone app works similarly to Apple’s implementation. On my iPhone, I find caller ID announcements to be really useful — it’s very handy to know who’s calling before I even look at my phone. Caller ID announcements are also a great accessibility feature, allowing people with visual disabilities to more easily know who is calling them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lDqf3"&gt;Sadly, most of the call announcements I hear are for spam calls or numbers I don’t recognize. I really wish that Apple offered something like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122390/google-assistant-screen-call-robocalls-spam-phone-pixel"&gt;Google’s automatic call screening&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en"&gt;all Pixel users in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk impersonators have stolen more than $2 million in cryptocurrency since October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Elon Musk Receives Axel Springer Award" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34UJVTL74XMCJ50p94qm6ivMIgk=/0x58:4000x2725/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299408/1229901686.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDychf"&gt;Consumers lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency to scammers impersonating Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over the last six months, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/spotting-cryptocurrency-investment-scams"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission reported Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BmjA9"&gt;“Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams,” the commission said in its Monday report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z6oJai"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="561eGT"&gt;For years, scammers have posed as Musk in order to fraud social media users out of cryptocurrency. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17096128/twitter-vitalik-buterin-elon-musk-cryptocurrency-scams"&gt;They use deceptive tactics on sites like Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, often using the same avatar images as Musk’s own account and slightly misspelling his username. Pretending to be Musk, the scammers will ask victims to send currency to a specific wallet address in exchange for receiving a larger payment in return. The scams violate &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation#:~:text=You%20can't%20mislead%20others,we%20take%20into%20consideration%20include%3A&amp;amp;text=use%20of%20intentionally%20misleading%20profile%20information%2C%20including%20profile%20location."&gt;Twitter’s policy against deceptive accounts&lt;/a&gt;, but moderators have struggled to rein in the activity, and it remains prevalent on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDhtIW"&gt;The $2 million figure was revealed in a larger report on cryptocurrency published by the FTC on Monday. Since last October, consumers reported losing more than $80 million in cryptocurrency scams, increasing “more than ten-fold year-over-year,” the commission said. Consumers lose around $1,900 through these scams on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQoqa0"&gt;Musk himself was a target in one of the largest Twitter bitcoin scams last summer. In one of the largest breaches in Twitter history, attackers compromised accounts belonging to Musk, President Barack Obama, President Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and even Apple to promote a bitcoin scam. The attackers received nearly $120,000 from the scam &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;that forced Twitter to block&lt;/a&gt; all verified users from posting new tweets for several hours. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focusing on personal responsibility still isn’t a good way to manage public health</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9uRNMmUG4j3ELlWGnLrsN2NKBLk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299361/acastro_200512_1777_faceMask_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wAnQyn"&gt;Public health experts and communities around the country are still struggling to make sense of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new mask guidelines. Last week, the CDC said it no longer thinks people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 need to wear masks in most situations. But cases of COVID-19 are still high in many places, and &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;less than 40 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZTQaG"&gt;In efforts to clarify and explain the agency’s thinking, CDC director Rochelle Walensky focused on the risk COVID-19 poses to each individual person who decides to wear a mask or not wear a mask. People who are vaccinated can decide to skip a mask knowing that they’re safer, and people who aren’t vaccinated should keep them on or sign up for a shot. If they don’t wear a mask, they could be more at risk of catching COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbIQxL"&gt;“I might say people are responsible for their own health,” Walensky told &lt;em&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands.” She posted similar language &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1393312416373645317"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: “Your health is in your hands.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlPctv"&gt;But over a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, if we’ve learned one thing about infectious diseases, it’s that our health is never just in our hands. It’s a core idea of public health: even if people make the best possible effort to stay well, they can still get sick. If there’s more virus around in a community, everyone is more at risk, regardless of what precautions they take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hj4Ama"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It is a fundamental tenet of public health that no one’s health is completely in their own hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to transmission of infections, many societal, environmental, and political forces override our best attempts at staying safe &amp;amp; healthy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N2Y3ZknlW7"&gt;https://t.co/N2Y3ZknlW7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr Ellie Murray (@EpiEllie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1393645496691052550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTynVN"&gt;Easing up on mask-wearing recommendations could still be a good call — or at the very least, a reasonable one. The new guidelines might encourage more people to get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines also work extremely well: people who are fully vaccinated are at very low risk of catching and getting sick from the disease, so they may not need the extra protection from a mask. They’re also not a major danger to others: there’s a very low chance they’ll have COVID-19, and if they do catch the virus, they probably won’t have enough of it in their bodies that they can pass it to someone else. So they don’t need a mask to block potentially infectious particles from spraying into a room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bazVDN"&gt;But it’s frustrating that Walensky chose to stress a shift to personal responsibility as the rationale — only &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/04/06/984745020/biden-will-direct-states-to-make-all-adults-vaccine-eligible-by-april-19"&gt;four weeks&lt;/a&gt; after vaccine eligibility opened up to all adults (and just days after 12- to 15-year-olds became eligible). People who got their shots recently still aren’t fully vaccinated. Others may not have found the time to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/1394055840865337344"&gt;schedule a shot&lt;/a&gt; around their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/us/covid-vaccines-vulnerable.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;work hours&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmtA0w"&gt;With those limitations, pushing the burden of staying safe onto individuals makes things hard on everyone. In response to the CDC announcement, for example, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/walmart-trader-joes-costco-no-masks-customers.html"&gt;stores like Walmart and Costco&lt;/a&gt; are no longer requiring customers to wear masks. Most say unvaccinated people still need to wear masks, but they’re not going to ask for evidence that someone is vaccinated before they go into the stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KknNRu"&gt;Someone who isn’t vaccinated could easily decide to not wear a mask in Walmart. In an indoor space like a crowded store, they’d be more at risk of contracting COVID-19, especially in an area where the virus is still circulating. That person is taking their health into their own hands — but they’re also putting the people around them at risk.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wn0lZ"&gt;Kids under 12 can’t get vaccinated yet, and even with a mask on, they could catch the disease from a maskless unvaccinated adult. Even people who &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;vaccinated are at increased risk. The shots aren’t perfect, and some vaccinated, otherwise healthy people still end up catching COVID-19. The situation is worse for people who are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/health/coronavirus-vaccine-immune-system.html"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, like people who have had organ transplants. For them, even if they are able to get a shot, their vaccine might not work as well as someone else’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nArTKw"&gt;The amount of risk that comes with taking a mask off isn’t just determined by the vaccination status of the person who decides to remove it. It’s also affected by the decisions of the people around them — whether they decide to take their masks off and whether they’re vaccinated. Health is, as always, collective. The way the CDC talks about its decisions should reflect that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhHql3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo’s electric van will start at $34,750</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24C17SWG3VhE7wY-Ww0VsE-VYtk=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299197/1_midlander_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHUt3R"&gt;California EV startup Canoo has finally &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/56/promises-kept---canoo-pricing-for-lifestyle-vehicle-is"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; pricing for the electric van it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"&gt;announced back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The “lifestyle” van, as Canoo calls it, will start at $34,750 and cost as much as $49,950 for the most capable model, before additional equipment or tax incentives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxnMkS"&gt;Canoo has also started accepting $100 deposits for the van as well as for the electric pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;truck it revealed in March&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;delivery van it debuted late last year&lt;/a&gt;. Pricing was not given for the pickup, though Canoo has said the base price for the delivery van will be $33,000. Canoo’s lifestyle van is slated to go into production sometime in 2022, though it won’t start production on the other two vehicles until at least 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ5diH"&gt;All three vehicles are built on the same modular electric vehicle platform that Canoo has been developing for a few years. In the largest configuration, with an 80kWh battery pack, the lifestyle van should get around 250 miles of range. Canoo also says it will sell the van in four different trims, including an “adventure” version with more ground clearance and “a more muscular profile.” Exactly who will build the van remains a mystery; Canoo has said it will tap a contract manufacturer, but it has not formally announced one yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSp7JR"&gt;Originally called Evelozcity, Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a group of executives and engineers who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;split off from EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;struggling mightily at the time&lt;/a&gt;. They created the van but also tried to license out the platform it’s built on to other automakers and companies looking for a quick solution to bringing an electric vehicle to market. Canoo signed a deal with Hyundai to build vehicles on the platform in 2020 and to provide some engineering services to the automaker. And as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported in January, Canoo even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;held talks with Apple about using its electric vehicle platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fxe59n"&gt;That founding group’s original goal was to offer the electric van on a subscription-only basis, but a lot has changed at Canoo in the last year. The startup merged with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) and is now publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange, raising some $600 million in the process. Canoo’s leadership has also been overhauled. Tony Aquila, a businessman who came in as an investor near the start of the SPAC merger process last year, became Canoo’s executive chairman and is now also its CEO after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;one of the startup’s founding executives resigned in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9pC4v"&gt;Aquila has focused Canoo more on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;commercial market for electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; since taking power at the startup. He downplayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;the subscription model in March&lt;/a&gt;, though Canoo does still plan to offer it in some capacity. And he pivoted Canoo away from providing engineering work to other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;apparently killing the deal with Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nreal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pgdadR"&gt;Epic Games has sued smart glasses maker Nreal for infringing on its Unreal Engine trademark. Epic, which &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nced.187547/gov.uscourts.nced.187547.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed the case late last week&lt;/a&gt;, claims it’s “no coincidence” that Nreal’s name “looks and sounds virtually identical” to Unreal’s branding. As Nreal plans a US launch later this year, Epic wants to recoup damages and scuttle its application for a trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q71JJv"&gt;Epic argues that on top of “Nreal” sounding a lot like “Unreal,” both companies are competing in the same space. The China-based Nreal makes an augmented reality headset known as the Nreal Light, which projects 3D objects into real space, and it’s developed &lt;a href="https://developer.nreal.ai/nreal-tower"&gt;a demo game&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Nreal Tower. &lt;/em&gt;Its glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362407/nreal-light-ar-glasses-lg-uplus-samsung-galaxy-note-retail-launch-availability-price"&gt;shipped in Korea&lt;/a&gt; last year, and Nreal has gradually expanded their availability, announcing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/22/nreal-unveils-enterprise-edition-of-mixed-reality-glasses/"&gt;plans for a US launch&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG6QM8"&gt;Meanwhile, Epic’s Unreal Engine is a ubiquitous game-making tool that’s also used for films and general purpose 3D design. Epic has &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/epic-games-ceo-ar-glasses-will-eventually-replace-smartphones/"&gt;signaled interest&lt;/a&gt; in augmented reality, although it hasn’t indicated that it’s building hardware. And the lawsuit notes that “Epic expects Unreal Engine to feature prominently in the creation of a virtual metaverse, a real time three-dimensional social platform where friends meet to interact and have enjoyable experiences.” Nreal’s glasses even support the Unreal Engine. Epic claims that all this potential crossover could confuse customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uds28J"&gt;Epic and Nreal have been quietly fighting over the “Unreal” trademark for years. Epic filed to block Nreal’s trademark in 2018, and the companies &lt;a href="https://next.reality.news/news/epic-games-enters-settlement-talks-with-nreal-over-trademark-naming-dispute-0213689/"&gt;discussed a settlement&lt;/a&gt; after that. But Epic’s suit claims the discussion was “fruitless.” And Nreal recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nreal/status/1392811921473216521"&gt;tweeted a promise&lt;/a&gt; of “big news” on May 20th, saying that “something you’ve all been waiting for is on its way.” Epic sued the day after that tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make an AirTag holder for your pet’s collar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzttfcZZg-DE7iVzlfQ8d3zQmGM=/0x88:2040x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298626/verge_IMG_7566_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hank being a good boy with an AirTag sleeve fitted to his existing dog collar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocCNe3"&gt;One seemingly obvious use for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag&amp;amp;sharedid=vergeairtagholderpet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29 AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt; is for pets. As a new dog owner, I wanted to add an AirTag to my dog’s existing leather collar, but the options currently available are lousy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjrJAr"&gt;AirTags are small, but they’re not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; small. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fairtag&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Most AirTag holders&lt;/a&gt; currently available from Apple and its partners assume I’m okay with dangling a 0.39-ounce (11-gram) pendant off my medium-sized beagle’s neck. I’m not, which is how I came up with the idea for a DIY neoprene sleeve that keeps the IP67 water- and dust-resistant AirTag snuggly attached to Hank’s existing collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mE3gf7"&gt;I’m not going to suggest that AirTags are the best way to track your pets — they’re not. But they’re relatively cheap, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gps-pet-trackers/"&gt;dedicated GPS / GSM pet trackers&lt;/a&gt; that require monthly subscriptions. Apple’s Find My network coverage is also more limited. Nevertheless, an AirTag is better than nothing, especially in populated areas where any nearby iPhone can alert you to your missing pet’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="K7nISO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZy_FBQ2NrPfmtHmQwYAGs9D_ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519991/verge_IMG_7489_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sewn version of the AirTag sleeve and the dog collar it was designed for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F26NeP"&gt;Why not buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6OfWYP"&gt;A few companies have already announced AirTag accessories designed specifically for pets. The problem is that none of them are currently shipping, and most are downright expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ldl1as"&gt;There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeAirpodPetTags&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-pet-tag-airtag-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29.95 Nomad Rugged Pet Tag&lt;/a&gt; case, which can be engraved with your phone number for an extra $19.95. But it’s still just a pendant and doesn’t ship until August. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.studioproper.com.au/products/dogtag"&gt;€19.95AUD Studio Proper DogTag&lt;/a&gt; that fits snuggly to existing collars but doesn’t ship until the end of July. And finally, there’s the expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.followpaw.com%2Fproducts%2Ffollowpaw-dog-collar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$47.95 FollowPaw collar&lt;/a&gt; with built-in AirTag pocket, which doesn’t ship until June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGyXkk"&gt;One day, I’ll probably buy a dedicated AirTag holder for my dog — one that fits snuggly to his existing collar and comes engraved with his name and my phone number so that I can remove his redundant dog tag. Until then, DIY seems like the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtE_EAbr5Un32piTYC01K4HwHtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519973/verge_IMG_7515_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need scissors, neoprene fabric, and either neoprene glue (easy!) or the ability to sew (easy for some!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YkkKlo"&gt;Materials needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IH6UIl"&gt;My AirTag sleeve is built from neoprene, a durable and stretchy material that’s easy to find. I’d suggest buying it from a local crafts or fabric store so you can check out the colors, thicknesses, and stretchiness in person. You might even be able to haggle for a few free scraps instead of buying in bulk as required by most Amazon sellers. The neoprene I used is 2mm thick and lacks any additional waterproofing, allowing it to be soft and stretchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H7Irx"&gt;If sewing isn’t an option, then you’ll need some neoprene glue. As an avid surfer, I had easy access to scraps of neoprene, which I could assemble into a tube with the neoprene glue in my wetsuit repair kit. For everyone else, you can expect the glue and neoprene to cost no more than $10 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EKn0AK"&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="bmAvKk"&gt;Cut the neoprene into a rectangle about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) in length and wide enough to wrap snugly around your pet’s existing collar with enough overlapping material to either glue or sew it into place. A longer tube might help prevent the AirTag from popping out over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Xf6DhZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KsQjok"&gt;Shape into a tube that just fits the width of the pet collar and then glue or sew the neoprene into shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Njzclo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rVM5Yu"&gt;Slide the collar through the tube, then slowly work the AirTag into one end of the neoprene sleeve until it is centered. It helps to rotate the AirTag as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNNAjX"&gt;Attach to dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>You can now explore a surreal Gucci garden inside Roblox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgpRta3TQ9-eomcvltUbDco4TXQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298531/Come_as_You_Are_RSVP_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NuOkjI"&gt;For the next two weeks, the virtual realm of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is getting a dose of high fashion. Currently, fashion house Gucci is hosting an artsy garden space, &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/05/gucci-garden-experience/"&gt;which will be available for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; users to explore starting today through to May 31st&lt;/a&gt;. The space was conceived as a virtual counterpart to a real-world installation called the Gucci Garden Archetypes, which is taking place in Florence, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FOyMd"&gt;Both the virtual and IRL spaces are described as multimedia experiences, which are divided into a series of themed rooms with names like “urban romanticism” and “Tokyo tribe.” It all sounds pretty surreal. Here’s the official description of what you’ll be doing in the digital version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aI3qdw"&gt;As they enter the Gucci Garden experience, visitors will shed their avatars becoming a neutral mannequin. Without gender or age, the mannequin symbolizes that we all begin our journeys through life as a blank canvas. Wandering through the different rooms, visitors’ mannequins absorb elements of the exhibition. With every person experiencing the rooms in a different order and retaining different fragments of the spaces, they will emerge at the end of their journey as one-of-a-kind creations, reflecting the idea of individuals as one among many, yet wholly unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;aside id="Vw2bjX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The latest modern art installation is inside Fortnite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21308391/fortnite-creative-manchester-international-festival-art-exhibition-laturbo-avedon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EchAEqIEazWTV726-7yNGSZ63cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520042/In_Bloom_room_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-ASMYD12TUlob9vXV110_g8VZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520058/The_Collectors_Room_1__Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/of3NgwnFmYVj-OyfGQF8Dkj2OGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520063/Tokyo_Tribe_room_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1VLZKw"&gt;It may sound like a strange combination, but over the last year, fashion and gaming have become much more closely connected. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22340775/honor-of-kings-burberry-skin-fashion-video-games"&gt;Burberry launched in-game outfits for a Chinese strategy game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;Balenciaga made a post-apocalyptic world in place of a traditional runway show&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;Louis Vuitton dressed up a virtual hip-hop group made up of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; characters&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, this isn’t even Gucci’s first foray into the space; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340621/gucci-virtual-25-sneaker-ar-vrchat-roblox"&gt;the company previously made a pair of virtual sneakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqt1Nf"&gt;Just remember: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340621/gucci-virtual-25-sneaker-ar-vrchat-roblox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is definitely not a video game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redbox still exists, plans to go public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Redbox 3 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgpRPR080ir28LDsgQgl1DJq0YU=/0x0:1017x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298429/DSC_0952-VERGE.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H3UqZd"&gt;If you live in a major metropolitan area with great high-speed internet, you will be forgiven for forgetting Redbox exists. But the company that rents new releases from big red kiosks at grocery stores is still alive and kicking, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/redbox-goes-public-spac-1234974560/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; it intends to go public after it was acquired by the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Seaport Global Acquisition Corp. The new company is reportedly valued at $693 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSrAkF"&gt;Redbox has had success operating completely counter to Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and all the other behemoth streamers that rely on set-top boxes, new TVs, and solid internet to function. According to Redbox, around 70 percent of its customers would be classified as “late adopters.” They’re people who still use CRT TVs, dabble with DSL, and if they’re anything like the Redbox users I know, glare at cloud-based computing suspiciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJwA8E"&gt;However, despite focusing on what appears to be my mother and her best friend, the company has begun to branch out from kiosks. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138485/redbox-free-live-tv-ad-supported-streaming-platform-launch-rollout"&gt;February 2020, it launched an ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165692/redbox-ad-supported-free-streaming-movies"&gt;added videos on demand in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hdd085"&gt;Redbox told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;it plans to use the cash from going public to pay down debt and expand its VOD services. With just 40,000 kiosks and 39 million subscribers, it will need to do some rapid expansion to keep up with its rivals. Disney Plus, which launched in 2019, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;over 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix, which Redbox began as a rival to in 2002, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/20/netflix-new-subscriber-numbers/"&gt;has over 200 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXwknU"&gt;Redbox is expected to go public in the third quarter this year with the ticker symbol “RDBX.”&lt;/p&gt;

You can spend a lot on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;best gaming mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt;, and on a keyboard.

&lt;p id="LG0fDN"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi routers from Amazon’s Eero 6 lineup are discounted both at Amazon and at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740809378744705856#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Just one router &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $103&lt;/a&gt; instead of $129, but if you want a Wi-Fi router and an extender to cover more space with Wi-Fi signal, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B085WS7H6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that’s $159&lt;/a&gt;, down from $199. Both of these options are good for small living spaces without a bunch of devices that don’t require being hard-wired to Ethernet. (Note: the Eero 6 router has two Ethernet ports, while extenders have none.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbzxo9"&gt;However, if you live in a bigger place or you want to ensure that all of your favorite gadgets are wired in instead of using Wi-Fi, get the three-pack of Eero 6 routers at Amazon for $279.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YDdcJR"&gt;LG’s 65-inch CX OLED 4K TV is $1,896 at a few retailers, which is the same price that we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday last year. Amazon currently has this price, as does Costco, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740810152791662584" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This TV model is well-suited to handle any kind of content, with unparalleled picture quality and contrast. It also has HDMI 2.1 ports, so you’ll be able to get up to a 120Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution in devices that support it, like the Xbox Series X, PS5, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="n9i28m"&gt;If you want to save $20 or so on the Apple AirPods Pro and you don’t mind betting on a refurbished set, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740810617716332006#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling certified refurbs for $170. The page description says that this model includes small and large silicone ear tips, a wireless charging case, and a Lightning to USB-C cable for recharging. The most affordable price for a new set is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$197&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve seen them sell new for $189 regularly. If you can’t wait, this deal at Best Buy might be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
