    <title>Canon’s new camera kits make it easier to turn your DLSR and mirrorless into webcams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dSPjzwvsH1-flwPiEt8VhqLDhX8=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984133/vlcsnap_2021_03_17_15h19m52s233__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UisRoq"&gt;If you’ve got a recent Canon DSLR or mirrorless camera and are interested in getting more use out of it, Canon announced today that it would soon begin selling webcam accessory kits, allowing Canon owners an easier way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241305/canon-cameras-dslr-eos-webcam-utility-released"&gt;retool their cameras as high-quality webcams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUFL66"&gt;Each kit has different parts, but all three packages include a USB cable to connect your camera to your desktop computer or laptop, and a battery insert and power cord so that you can continually keep your Canon camera powered with a wall outlet. It is important to note that none of these kits include a tripod to mount your camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7YKZcj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Webcams have been in high demand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jv78cf"&gt;Canon has announced three versions of its accessory kit, which are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fl%2F%3Fsearchinfo%3Dcanon%2520webcam%2520kits%26sel%3DItem-Condition_New-Items&amp;amp;subid1=CanonWebcamStory03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Canon+webcam+kit&amp;amp;i=amazon-devices&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735187887684653293#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DCanon%2520webcam%2520kits%26filters%3Dfct_a_filter_by%253A07_NEW_RELEASE%252Cfct_category%253Aaccessory_kits_4969&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22336762%2Fcanon-webcam-accessory-kits-dslr-mirrorless-cameras" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, with both retailers noting that preorders are expected to ship on March 25th. The two most affordable kits are compatible with &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Ficawcskm.html&amp;amp;subid1=CanonWebcamStory03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;EOS M cameras&lt;/a&gt; (M50, M50 Mark II &amp;amp; M200) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/17351879635939234593donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EOS Rebel cameras&lt;/a&gt; (Rebel T3, T5, T6 &amp;amp; T7), and cost $89.99 each. The more expensive kit, which works with &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630732-REG%2Fcanon_1425c009_eos_webcam_accessories_starter.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EOS RP cameras&lt;/a&gt;, will retail for $159.99. Alternatively, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACK-E18-Adapter-Charger-Coupler-Replace/dp/B074K181L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a third-party charging kit&lt;/a&gt; and supply your own USB cable for less than the Canon kits cost; or if you don’t own a camera at all, you can buy a webcam starter kit for as low as $466 on &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fdslr-webcam-bundles#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VZaMJ"&gt;Within the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;webcams have been in high demand&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic as many people work from home or rely on videoconferencing tools to communicate. Canon, like its competitors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241305/canon-cameras-dslr-eos-webcam-utility-released"&gt;already released software&lt;/a&gt; that allowed owners to repurpose select Canon cameras as webcams to address the shortages. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola’s Ready For brings a DeX-style desktop to the Edge Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yLQp0sZ0n56nOcF9EuGWI_6YvYU=/0x258:5792x4119/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983843/motorola.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O2YGmO"&gt;Motorola is expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241919/motorola-edge-plus-review-android-phone-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;Edge Plus flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; with a new, desktop computer interface called Ready For. Similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15495036/samsung-dex-station-galaxy-s8-review-desktop-dock"&gt;Samsung’s DeX&lt;/a&gt;, Ready For allows users to plug their smartphone into a larger screen (using either a USB-C to USB-C or USB-C to HDMI cable), allowing the Edge Plus (and presumably, future Motorola phones) to be used as a computer or even a set-top box alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5u8jR"&gt;The company actually envisions four different use cases for Ready For. On the most basic level, users can convert the Edge Plus into a mobile desktop computer setup, complete with a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard — similar to DeX. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1crHudJe_wDrGHgdy1q0iSCVbmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378484/Ready_For_Edge__Bundle_1_Campaign_Wallpaper.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VyRT5v"&gt;But Motorola also has more interesting ideas for how to use the Edge Plus. One more, for instance, turns the Edge Plus into a videoconference station, using the superior cameras on the smartphone (either the 108-megapixel main lens or the 16-megapixel ultrawide lens) for a better video chat experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNW2oW"&gt;There are also entertainment options. Players can pair a controller and use the Edge Plus as a makeshift console, either for native mobile games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or with game-streaming services like xCloud. Users can also hook up their phone as an easily portable set-top box — Motorola envisions plugging the Edge Plus into a hotel room TV, for instance, giving you access to all your already logged-in streaming apps when you’re traveling without having to worry about your room’s Wi-Fi setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBoASV"&gt;Ready For (or DeX) isn’t the first attempt to turn a smartphone into a computer. Mobile phone history is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837263/samsung-dex-note-10-plus-palm-foleo-motorola-atrix-celio-redfly"&gt;littered with past attempts&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-05-30-palm-foleo-hands-on.html"&gt;aborted Palm Foleo&lt;/a&gt; or Motorola’s own &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmotorola-lapdock%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22336800%2Fmotorola-ready-edge-plus-verizon-dex-desktop-atrix-lapdock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Atrix 4G’s LapDock accessory&lt;/a&gt;. And while Motorola’s use cases here are a little ambitious (and, perhaps, a little optimistic about the number of users who routinely keep HDMI to USB-C cables around), there are certainly more creative ideas for converting a phone to a larger screen beyond a half-baked desktop computer experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuezOC"&gt;Motorola’s Ready For experience is set to roll out to Edge Plus users on Verizon starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnSaL4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/caCIHhBVZoua5nMBOOaobh1UtEY=/0x0:5600x3733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983577/DSCF3107.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pY1Fcn"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked Lordstown Motors for more information about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;allegations&lt;/a&gt; that the EV startup misled investors about its progress to date. Lordstown Motors said Wednesday that it is cooperating with the inquiry and that its board of directors has created a special committee to review the claims. The startup is backed by General Motors, which has a seat on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eljDcb"&gt;The allegations came last Friday from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;short-selling firm Hindenburg Research&lt;/a&gt;, which disclosed along with the report that it had taken a short position in Lordstown Motors. The firm previously released a report about hydrogen trucking startup Nikola that similarly led to probes from the SEC and the Department of Justice. (General Motors was also planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726594/gm-nikola-deal-equity-badger-truck-hydrogen"&gt;take a stake in Nikola before that report&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fn75tI"&gt;Hindenburg claimed in the report that some of the EV startup’s biggest preorders were made by companies that do not appear to have the money required to purchase big batches of Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck, which starts at around $50,000. Hindenburg also claimed that Lordstown Motors misled the public, investors, and the government about the progress it’s made so far on the prototypes of its Endurance electric pickup truck, and pointed to a recent fire as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rPCEa"&gt;“We want to take a moment and acknowledge that we are aware of the short-seller’s report,” CEO Steve Burns said on an earnings call Wednesday, before disclosing the SEC inquiry and the internal review. “That is all we can say, and we cannot comment on this during the Q&amp;amp;A period following this call, or any follow-up questions and conversations, until the special committee has finished its review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NkZKj5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I3ha7a"&gt;Lordstown Motors went public in late 2020 as part of a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, and raised $675 million in cash. Wednesday’s earnings call was the startup’s first with investors as a public company. Just before it, the company reported that it lost $101 million in 2020 but finished the year with $630 million in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUz9SQ"&gt;Burns previously said the Hindenburg report was full of half-truths and lies, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ev-startup-lordstown-motors-is-targeted-by-short-seller-hindenburg-research-shares-fall-16-11615569913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s always haters,” he said on Monday, according to local outlet &lt;a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/theres-always-haters-lordstown-motors-ceo-responds-to-negative-report/"&gt;WKBN&lt;/a&gt;. “I quoted Taylor Swift to somebody the other day: ‘Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. You gotta shake it off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4af7e"&gt;The SEC’s inquiry and the internal review aren’t slowing down Lordstown Motors, at least not yet. The startup said Wednesday that it’s accelerating development of a second vehicle: an electric van. Burns also said Lordstown Motors remains committed to shipping the first Endurance electric pickup trucks this coming September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;at the Lordstown, Ohio facility that the startup bought from General Motors in 2019&lt;/a&gt; — a deal that was praised by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUWkMa"&gt;Lordstown Motors is only targeting commercial fleet sales in the near term for the Endurance, but the startup is nonetheless racing to bring the electric pickup to market so that it can be the first one produced at scale. The startup is at an advantage compared to some of its peers because it basically got started with a factory in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXKnU"&gt;Burns said Wednesday that he believes the Endurance will be an attractive option for state and local governments, especially following President Biden’s push to electrify the federal fleet. He also said the military is interested, though he did not share any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2igLPy"&gt;“Everybody feels demand is not going to be our problem,” Burns said. “There is no company on planet Earth six months away from entering into mass production — not hand building — mass production of a full-size electric pickup truck.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gILvbp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV finally adds Nick Jr. (and the rest of ViacomCBS’s channels)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NSz0OszL3Ithb2s61a4tTEMmFrs=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983498/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SWAFoG"&gt;YouTube TV added popular missing channels like MTV and Nickelodeon in 2020 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;striking a deal with ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt;, but now the streaming service is finally adding in the remaining stragglers like Nick Jr. and MTV2, according to &lt;a href="https://www.whattowatch.com/news/youtube-tv-adds-the-missing-batch-of-viacomcbs-channels"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatToWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSenRm"&gt;The new additions include Nick Jr., Teen Nick, Nicktoons, MTV Classic, MTV2, Dabl, and BET Her. Generally these channels are spinoffs of more well-known offerings like BET and MTV, but Nick Jr.’s younger children’s programming will definitely have some parents breathing a sigh of relief. Dabl — which I had never heard of before today — is apparently ViacomCBS’s “lifestyle-oriented network” for licensing cooking and homemaking shows like &lt;em&gt;Emeril Live&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Martha Stewart Living&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probably great for a late-night marathon or your daily background noise while working around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfylHk"&gt;Unlike the original addition of ViacomCBS’s biggest channels, this new drop won’t come with a price increase to YouTube TV, but it is the most recent in a collection of small updates the service has received in the last month. In February, YouTube TV announced that it plans to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286374/youtube-tv-4k-streaming-offline-viewing-announced"&gt;a 4K streaming option and offline downloads&lt;/a&gt;. That same month, it also introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289589/youtube-tv-hbo-max-showtime-starz-bundle-virtual-premium-cable"&gt;a $30 add-on bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz for $5 cheaper than they would be separately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube can now warn creators about copyright issues before videos are posted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRow8qz9JoKV5i7a_3BbdSA4Q84=/231x0:1287x704/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983312/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_3.25.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k0udkz"&gt;In an effort to make the process of uploading a video and receiving ad revenue easier, YouTube is rolling out a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/102365314"&gt;new tool called “Checks”&lt;/a&gt; that tells a creator ahead of time if their video contains copyrighted material and complies with advertising guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUdcyS"&gt;Prior to Checks, creators uploaded their videos to YouTube and hoped everything went off &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/10/17268102/youtube-demonetization-pewdiepie-logan-paul-casey-neistat-philip-defranco"&gt;without a hitch&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;uploads for copyrighted content&lt;/a&gt;, which could lead to takedowns or copyright holders claiming ad revenue, and whether the video runs afoul of advertising guideline issues. YouTube’s goal is to effectively cut down on the amount of “yellow icons” creators see next to their video, referring to the yellow dollar signs that suggest ad revenue is being held because of copyright or guideline problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxn6tH"&gt;This new system is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/13/12165194/youtube-content-id-2-billion-paid"&gt;reliant on Content ID&lt;/a&gt;. If YouTube’s copyright identification system finds a violation after a video is scanned, the rights holder’s policy will be automatically applied to the video, according to the company. This could result in either the video being blocked entirely or the rights holders monetizing the video instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qed1Dm"&gt;If Content ID matches content in the creator’s video to another rights holder, the YouTuber uploading said video will receive notice via Checks to find a way to remove that part of the video ahead of time. This means that videos can start earning revenue the second they’re uploaded instead of going through a claim dispute, which can impact the overall advertising revenue a creator earns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRE4wt"&gt;So what happens if a copyright claim is found, but the creator doesn’t think they’re doing anything wrong? YouTube will allow creators to dispute the claim prior to publishing. Since claims take a few days to process, YouTubers can either choose to wait until the dispute is settled before publishing, or they can publish the video while waiting for the final result. If the dispute finds that the creator did not use copyrighted content, ad revenue earned during that time is paid out to said person. If the dispute finds the rights holder is correct, the ad revenue is paid out to them instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJDbki"&gt;YouTube is simply making it easier for creators to find — and dispute — claims ahead of time. It’s part of the company’s ongoing efforts to ensure that creators can monetize their videos as quickly and effectively as possible. Other methods, including walking creators through how changes to metadata and tagging can affect revenue post-publishing, are at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4qGiVCqeqg"&gt;a new Creators Insider video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B0A1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRND5H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s70eeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKW9bX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Greek letters ‘will never be used again’ to name hurricanes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An El Salvadorian rescue team member navigates through the..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CnrQ3R5zwZh3Wll9W1AeMluw7Sw=/0x2:3000x2002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983310/1229690809.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An El Salvadorian rescue team member navigates through a flooded street. Hurricane Iota hit the Nicaraguan coast on November 16th as a Category 4 storm. It was the second Category 4 to make landfall in Nicaragua within two weeks and again brought catastrophic rainfall into Honduras after Hurricane Eta.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Seth Sidney Berry / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2awRff"&gt;Greek letters will no longer be used to name tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, the World Meteorological Association (WMO) announced today. “The Greek alphabet will never be used again as it was distracting and confusing,” the WMO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WMO/status/1372254010875514888"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBuLoa"&gt;The WMO also retired the names of three especially devastating hurricanes from the 2020 season: Laura, Eta, and Iota. The name Dorian, from the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, was retired as well. The decision was made this week during a meeting of the WMO’s Hurricane Committee. They meet every year to determine which storms caused so much damage and death during the last hurricane season that they should be removed from rotating lists of storm names. 2019 names were also discussed this year because the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted last year’s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mjd9Cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the first time that any Greek letters have been retired&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T3EcBh"&gt;Alphabetical lists of names for Atlantic tropical cyclones repeat every six years. There are 21 names per list, and names that have been retired are replaced with names that start with the same letter. In the past, the Greek alphabet was used when there were more storms in a single hurricane season than names on the list. That’s only happened twice, in 2005 and 2020. Last year’s Atlantic hurricane season was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;most active on record&lt;/a&gt;. Back in 2006, the committee “&lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/2020-hurricane-season-exhausts-regular-list-of-names"&gt;agreed that it was not practical&lt;/a&gt;” to retire Greek names because they’re used so infrequently. If the committee had stuck to their 2006 decision, then this year, Eta and Iota would have&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;remained in rotation, but “Eta 2020” and “Iota 2020” would be added to the list of retired names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhrHoK"&gt;Eta and Iota forced the WMO to reconsider those plans. Together, the storms killed 272 people and caused $9 billion in damages across Central America. “There was no formal plan for retiring Greek names, and the future use of these names would be inappropriate,” it said in its statement. This is the first time that any Greek letters have been retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3jmUnW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That took attention away from the actual impacts of the storms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yJwfL"&gt;The WMO gave a list of more reasons why it’s now decided to abandon the Greek alphabet altogether. Use of the Greek alphabet generated a lot of headlines in 2020 because it was so rare, but that took attention away from the actual impacts of the storms, the WMO said. On top of that, the names can be confusing when translated to other languages. Similar-sounding letters — Zeta, Eta, and Theta — also caused some miscommunication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7SKul"&gt;The WMO decided to replace the Greek alphabet with a &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/supplemental-list-of-tropical-cyclone-names-raiv"&gt;supplemental list&lt;/a&gt; of names. Like the standard list of names, that supplemental&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;list will also be based on the modern English alphabet, excluding Q, U, X, Y, and Z. The WMO said in a press release that names starting with those letters are “not common enough or easily understood in local languages to be slotted into the rotating lists.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7zFPT"&gt;Dexter will replace the name Dorian. Dorian struck the Bahamas as a devastating Category 5 storm, damaging 75 percent of all the homes on the Abaco and eastern Grand Bahama Islands. The name Leah will replace Laura. Hurricane Laura was responsible for 47 deaths and more than $19 billion in destruction in the US and Hispaniola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVj4AD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NSfpm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s season 6 opening cinematic was co-directed by the Russo brothers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxdLQE-9fuWLWCxhqWt1CirddpU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68983086/16BR_Gameplay_Screenshots_Cinematic_Still6_1920x1080_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdYTxO"&gt;The start of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s latest season&lt;/a&gt; began with a three-minute-long cinematic that set up season 6’s story, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;the game’s first narrative-driven single-player experience&lt;/a&gt;. It was like a short, animated action movie — which makes sense, since it was co-directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, the pair best known for their work on &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt; movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEeAzb"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the Russo brothers said, “It’s been fantastic working with the team at Epic. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; holds a unique place in pop culture, and we think Donald Mustard is a visionary storyteller, who continues to take us all into unexplored territory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QUkYTJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We instantly had a shared vision.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L13gbu"&gt;The crossover isn’t too surprising, given the collaboration between Marvel and Epic in the past. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; even featured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;an entire Marvel-themed season that started last summer&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership dates back even further, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17326678/fortnite-avengers-crossover-thanos"&gt;to when Thanos appeared in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, as part of an &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; crossover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVr4gB"&gt;In fact, according to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; creative director Donald Mustard, it was Thanos’ appearance and the Russos that inspired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;the copious brand crossovers that are now so central to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQHgxB"&gt;“I got so lucky that early on I met Joe and Anthony Russo,” Mustard tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It wasn’t like we just became friends, it was like I found a lost family member or something. We instantly had a shared vision. It was when they were finishing up &lt;em&gt;Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;, and I took them through the whole story of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. ‘Here’s my idea of what we could do.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oKmcK"&gt;“And they were the first people to really help me, and help us, get through a lot of the barriers of how you bring different worlds together in a way that feels authentic. It started there, with Thanos, but it’s led to where we are now. In fact, that opening cinematic yesterday, that was directed by me and Joe and Anthony Russo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRqPWp"&gt;Stay tuned on more from our interview with Mustard soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Facebook is getting in the newsletter game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wWU5MSzOgSlOl8BnwOvdrsbJelo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68982975/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j4xBhk"&gt;Today let’s talk about platforms’ growing interest in building newsletter tools — and whether Facebook, against all conventional wisdom, might have an opportunity there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ROwGvi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="B56oeh"&gt;Newsletters made headlines today after Facebook announced a plan laying out some of its intentions in the space. In a blog post entitled “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/supporting-independent-voices"&gt;Supporting independent writers&lt;/a&gt;,” the company explained its point of view and sketched out the products it is now building. Campbell Brown, the company’s vice president for global news partnerships, and Anthea Watson Strong, a product manager for news, laid it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JH5fBi"&gt;A free, self-publishing tool with robust styling options to create individual websites and an email newsletter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cYJe9Z"&gt;An integration with Facebook Pages to enable publishing across various multimedia formats including photos, live videos, and stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SgEon6"&gt;The ability to create Facebook groups and nurture a community of readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0GSnLP"&gt;In addition, Facebook plans to offer features to help writers find audiences and sell subscriptions, as well as analytics tools and an accelerator program “to help creators come together and learn best practices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O7KsF"&gt;Before I go any further, let me acknowledge my conflicts here. As noted in my &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/platformer/Ethics-Policy-e8ee22c0ce7b4228b5da482a83b2ab76"&gt;ethics statement&lt;/a&gt;, I receive a health care subsidy and legal support from Substack, the company with which Facebook is most prominently competing here. At the same time, it’s in my interest to see lots of newsletter services thriving. As in most things, the more big companies that are competing for writers, the better off most writers will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89MSpg"&gt;That said, I still find Facebook’s move into newsletters a bit surreal, if only because I started a newsletter in 2017 as an end run &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; Facebook. Or rather, as an end run around the idea of algorithmic feeds in general. After the better part of a decade chasing audiences from platform to platform, I set out to build a strong, direct connection to an audience that wants to hear from me, and that I can reliably reach no matter how many likes, upvotes, or retweets any individual post happens to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDXjYw"&gt;I won’t rehearse Facebook’s long history with the news business here, but suffice to say it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/facebook-driven-video-push-may-have-cost-483-journalists-their-jobs/573403/"&gt;rocky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/links/instant-recall.html"&gt;mostly unsatisfying&lt;/a&gt; for just about everyone involved. At the same time, since the clear-eyed and opinionated-in-a-good-way Brown joined the company in 2017, Facebook’s news efforts have gradually bent toward realism. If the Facebook of old promised publishers the moon, the Facebook of today is more likely to promise as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1lzzxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;turning individual writers into successful tiny media companies feels like a logical next step&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hgIizS"&gt;But as the platform’s dominance has grown, so has the threat of onerous regulation. As their digital advertising revenues have shrunk, publishers around the world have gotten better at convincing lawmakers that Facebook (and Google) owe them a cut of that revenue. (&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-returns-news-to-australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; is the most recent example of this, and it will not be the last.) Facebook has grudgingly paid up, to no real material benefit to society — as I like to say in this space roughly once per day, the United States lost 16,000 journalism jobs last year. Platform subsidies have not been enough to stop the bleeding in the past, and I have no reason to believe they will do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eODlX6"&gt;Still, demands for those subsidies will only increase over the next year. For platforms, the natural response to those demands is to try to change the laws. Facebook will certainly continue to lobby around the world, but with newsletters it’s attempting a secondary strategy: it’s trying to &lt;em&gt;change the publishers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMt8h4"&gt;Facebook’s oft-repeated mission is to “give people a voice,” and yet for the first decade-plus of its existence, its media partnerships have largely been with big companies like CNN and News Corp. A more Facebook-like approach to media partnerships would be to start at the level of the individual and help people start building their businesses that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFLn9N"&gt;After a long period of inattention to creators, Facebook has been developing new ways for individuals to make money from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/new-ways-to-monetize-on-facebook-instagram"&gt;their large followings on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. It is doing the same in its Twitch rival, Facebook Gaming — which, incidentally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331623/twitch-facebook-gaming-pandemic-hours-watched"&gt;saw its watch time grow 79 percent last year&lt;/a&gt;. Viewed in this light, turning individual writers into successful tiny media companies feels like a logical next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhFu86"&gt;Not to say that Facebook’s newsletter ambitions have been received particularly warmly. “&lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161736/facebook-found-new-way-ruin-media"&gt;Facebook Has Found a New Way to Ruin Media&lt;/a&gt;,” a headline in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt; announced today. Jacob Silverman’s piece doesn’t really say anything specific about how Facebook newsletters would “ruin the media”; instead, it recounts how difficult the media business is for the people who work in it, and it casts doubt on the idea that solo entrepreneurs and small groups of collaborators can do much to change that. (My humble retort is that, uh, maybe we could try it first?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AAWXzr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;how committed will Facebook be to these creators over the long term?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EdfLn7"&gt;Certainly there are questions that any would-be media mogul should ask before throwing in with Facebook, and I asked the company a couple. For starters, will these “individual websites” be hosted on domains controlled by Facebook or the author? (If the author, yay; if Facebook, run.) Facebook told me it was “too soon to discuss those details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUQlq2"&gt;Second, will Facebook take a cut of subscription revenue? No answer there either, but a spokeswoman pointed out that Facebook currently takes no cut from revenue generated by subscriptions initiated through its Instant Articles product, and it has said it will not take a cut of any video creator revenue through at least August. If those are hints that Facebook will take a zero percent commission on newsletter subscription revenue — well, that will get the attention of at least a few creators who are currently giving up 5 or 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4sARh"&gt;The third question, and the most important one, I didn’t bother asking: how committed will Facebook be to these creators over the long term? Much of journalists’ enmity toward the company stems from the fact that what the platform amplifies changes all the time, making it shaky ground on which to build a business. But even assuming that Facebook’s enthusiasm for newsletters wanes over time, it might not be as catastrophic to the individual as the pivot to video was for big publishers. As long as creators can export their mailing lists and customer relationships when the time comes, they may find that the hassle was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BOICJ8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tbKOiq"&gt;Those are all questions about what’s in it for creators, though. Perhaps just as interesting is what’s in it for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYfw2K"&gt;On the surface, it may not seem obvious why the company would take an interest in helping people build businesses off the platform. But that view is rooted in the company’s old view of the News Feed, as a place that blended posts from your friends with links to articles from publishers on the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPkH13"&gt;Two years ago, though, Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/3/6/18253922/facebook-privacy-meaning-implications-mark-zuckerberg-pivot-analysis-interface-casey-newton"&gt;would gradually shift its product development to focus on private messaging and groups&lt;/a&gt;. And groups are the real opportunity for Facebook when it comes to newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yrwjDt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That looks like a win-win for Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLsDdL"&gt;The historian Heather Cox Richardson is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/business/media/heather-cox-richardson-substack-boston-college.html"&gt;the most successful individual authors on Substack&lt;/a&gt;, on track to earn more than $1 million in subscription revenue this year. Many of her subscribers come from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/heathercoxrichardson"&gt;her Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, which has 1.4 million followers. For most of us on Substack, newsletters offer a way to monetize our Twitter followings. But if you’re a Facebook executive, you look at Richardson and wonder whether you couldn’t help more people monetize their Facebook pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCqlhl"&gt;If Facebook could do that, and create a thousand Richardsons around the world, it would prove that the company can support a different kind of publishing, giving it a shiny new talking point as it wrestles with lawmakers around the world. And it would help to realize the company’s visions for groups as the starting point for many, or even most, of the discussions that the average person has on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5koGFp"&gt;That looks like a win-win for Facebook and ought to give prospective participants in this new experiment at least some confidence that the company’s commitment is real. (It’s also notable to me that Facebook announced these tools months before they are publicly available — a sign that the company wants them to be on the mind of anyone considering making a move in the short term, particularly those who have large Facebook followings and might otherwise consider Substack or the newly Twitter-owned Revue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHB66k"&gt;Anyway, I don’t know if any of this will &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; for Facebook. But it seems clear to me why the company would want to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2BhNsb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VsGbYj"&gt;Another reason why Facebook might have an opportunity is that Substack seems intent on giving them one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGFvAs"&gt;Some writers on the platform have been unhappy since Substack &lt;a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers"&gt;published a blog post last week announcing its “Pros” program&lt;/a&gt;, in which it offers some writers big advances to lure them to the platform. The list of writers to whom advances have been offered is not public, and I believe it to be more diverse than the public conversation over the past week has made it out to be. But among the Pros who have been open about their involvement, most of them are white and male like me. (I was offered an advance last year but turned it down, though I accepted other benefits, as disclosed above. If Substack considers me part of the “Pro” program, I am not aware of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mkglet"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I would lean all the way away from the culture war&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yrhYSl"&gt;The blog post characterized the decision to offer advances as “business decisions, not editorial ones,” which came across as wishful thinking. Meanwhile, some of the people who have taken advances have written various offensive things, both on and off Substack, and now some other writers are wondering &lt;a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay"&gt;whether remaining on the platform makes them complicit&lt;/a&gt;. (The logic is that their paid subscriptions are generating revenue that will then be used to fund further advances for people who attack journalists, or stoke fears about transgender people, and so on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4U9IC"&gt;Amid all this, Substack CEO Chris Best tweeted, without any other context, “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cjgbest/status/1370087142316109826"&gt;Defund the thought police&lt;/a&gt;,” seeming to side with the platform’s most lucrative edgelords over its more centrist and liberal creators. I’ve since received a few inquiries from writers asking whether being associated with Substack will damage their reputations over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmEXS7"&gt;If I were Substack, I would take pains to demonstrate that the platform offers financial support to creators across the political spectrum and draws hard lines around targeted harassment and bigotry. I would hire a really good head of communications and give her the passwords to the founders’ Twitter accounts. I would lean all the way away from the culture war — and toward building products and services that generate more revenue, for more people, than anyone else does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rba440"&gt;Because if Substack doesn’t, someone else will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8g8eaC"&gt;And it might just be Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FGnurW"&gt;
&lt;p id="sbsV0r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is giving away Horizon Zero Dawn and a bundle of great indie games for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Horizon Zero Dawn" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1FYQLcrZuj6iPIKCxFN0YMsjbzE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68982681/Aiming_at_Thunderjaw.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tcL47"&gt;As part of its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297009/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;Play at Home&lt;/a&gt;” initiative, Sony has announced &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/17/play-at-home-2021-update-10-free-games-to-download-this-spring/#sf244024254"&gt;the next 10 games&lt;/a&gt; it is giving away completely for free to PlayStation owners, including &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; and indie darlings, such as &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Witness. &lt;/em&gt;Incredibly, all of these games will be yours to own on PS4 and PS5, with no PlayStation Plus subscription required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWfRcl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; will be free to own beginning on April 19th at 8PM PT / 11PM ET and through May 14th; the game is one of the few PS4 exclusives missing from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, though that paid offer required both a PS5 and a PlayStation Plus subscription. Getting &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; completely for free now may be good timing for PlayStation owners, too, as the highly anticipated sequel, &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West,&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294561/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-release-date-2021-guerrilla-games-details-playstation"&gt;slated to launch on PS4 and PS5 sometime this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pbDeRf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony plans to offer more titles for PS4 and PS5 owners to claim&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt8BFV"&gt;Before the &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; promotion goes live, there’s a huge stack of other excellent games you can claim for free on PS4 and PS5 as well: &lt;em&gt;ABZÛ,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Rez Infinite, Subnautica,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Witness&lt;/em&gt;. Additionally, Sony will offer four PSVR titles for free: &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot Rescue Mission&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moss&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thumper&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Paper Beast. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgvgKW"&gt;Sony plans to offer more titles for PS4 and PS5 owners to claim, with the initiative slated to conclude sometime in June. Currently, Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308943/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony-ps-plus"&gt;offering &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; free of charge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;until March 31st at 8PM PT / 11PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
