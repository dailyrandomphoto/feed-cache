    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning: all the news about the electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M05kuoAxAe5w76vk5ExiZMxxYBY=/248x0:1193x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311382/2021_f_150_reveal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The electric version of the bestselling pickup truck is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="vMPVO7"&gt;Here’s everything you need to know about Ford’s new electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning. The automaker claims that this will be the most powerful F-150 ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUewwa"&gt;But when it goes into production next year, it will find itself in a suddenly very crowded market. Not only is Tesla’s polarizing Cybertruck expected to be out at the same time, but so is the GMC Hummer EV, Rivian R1T, and various other electric trucks from startups like Canoo and Lordstown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKSwwX"&gt;The US is a country of truck drivers. These boxy rigs are equally popular among hard-hat wearers and Costco shoppers alike. And while EVs represent only 2 percent of the overall car market, the opportunity to grow is enormous, with trucks occupying a $90 billion-a-year industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWOihm"&gt;The F-series is Ford’s most popular lineup. And it’s electrification represents a huge milestone for the company, for the auto world, and for the US economy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google made AI language the centerpiece of I/O while ignoring its troubled past at the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EhZY_Sr2nga1sfkcTOsM-1baRw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311376/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kinUzi"&gt;Yesterday at Google’s I/O developer conference, the company outlined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442328/google-io-2021-ai-language-model-lamda-pluto"&gt;ambitious plans&lt;/a&gt; for its future built on a foundation of advanced language AI. These systems, said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, will let users find information and organize their lives by having natural conversations with computers. All you need to do is speak, and the machine will answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SG1uy9"&gt;But for many in the AI community, there was a notable absence in this conversation: Google’s response to its own research examining the dangers of such systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jwU7Nk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Language models like Google’s come with a host of challenging risks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IB8ily"&gt;In December 2020 and February 2021, Google first fired Timnit Gebru and then Margaret Mitchell, co-leads of its Ethical AI team. The story of their departure is complex but was triggered by &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;a paper the pair co-authored&lt;/a&gt; (with researchers outside Google) examining risks associated with the language models Google now presents as key to its future. As the paper and other critiques note, these AI systems are prone to a number of faults, including the generation of abusive and racist language; the encoding of racial and gender bias through speech; and a general inability to sort fact from fiction. For many in the AI world, Google’s firing of Gebru and Mitchell amounted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22370158/google-ai-ethics-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing-reputation"&gt;censorship of their work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDRDki"&gt;For some viewers, as Pichai outlined how Google’s AI models would always be designed with “fairness, accuracy, safety, and privacy” at heart, the disparity between the company’s words and actions raised questions about its ability to safeguard this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQjWQa"&gt;“Google just featured LaMDA a new large language model at I/O,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mer__edith/status/1394740252410003458"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Meredith Whittaker, an AI fairness researcher and co-founder of the AI Now Institute. “This is an indicator of its strategic importance to the Co. Teams spend months preping these announcements. Tl;dr this plan was in place when Google fired Timnit + tried to stifle her+ research critiquing this approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UodbE0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google just featured LaMDA a new large language model at I/O. This is an indicator of its strategic importance to the Co. Teams spend months preping these announcements. Tl;dr this plan was in place when Google fired Timnit + tried to stifle her+ research critiquing this approach &lt;a href="https://t.co/6VObPJ1ebo"&gt;https://t.co/6VObPJ1ebo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Meredith Whittaker (@mer__edith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mer__edith/status/1394740252410003458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IOUH0d"&gt;Gebru herself &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1394717504119971844"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “This is what is called ethics washing” — referring to the tech industry’s tendency to trumpet ethical concerns while ignoring findings that hinder companies’ ability to make a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oy5sd5"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Emily Bender, a professor at the University of Washington who co-authored the paper with Gebru and Mitchell, said Google’s presentation didn’t in any way assuage her concerns about the company’s ability to make such technology safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rctYLn"&gt;“From the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; [discussing LaMDA] and given the history, I do not have confidence that Google is actually being careful about any of the risks we raised in the paper,” said Bender. “For one thing, they fired two of the authors of that paper, nominally over the paper. If the issues we raise were ones they were facing head on, then they deliberately deprived themselves of highly relevant expertise towards that task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jr9Nsj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google needs to be clearer about how it’s tackling these dangers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHT6g7"&gt;In its blog post on LaMDA, Google highlights a number of these issues and stresses that its work needs more development. “Language might be one of humanity’s greatest tools, but like all tools it can be misused,” writes senior research director Zoubin Ghahramani and product management VP Eli Collins. “Models trained on language can propagate that misuse — for instance, by internalizing biases, mirroring hateful speech, or replicating misleading information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwYa1Z"&gt;But Bender says the company is obfuscating the problems and needs to be clearer about how it’s tackling them. For example, she notes that Google refers to vetting the language used to train models like LaMDA but doesn’t give any detail about what this process looks like. “I’d very much like to know about the vetting process (or lack thereof),” says Bender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYOuHV"&gt;It was only after the presentation that Google made any reference to its AI ethics unit at all, in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-ai-chief-says-reputation-hit-to-unit-is-real-after-turmoil/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; with Google AI chief Jeff Dean. Dean noted that Google had suffered a real “reputational hit” from the firings — something &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22370158/google-ai-ethics-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing-reputation"&gt;has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; — but that the company had to “move past” these events. “We are not shy of criticism of our own products,” Dean told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. “As long as it’s done with a lens towards facts and appropriate treatment of the broad set of work we’re doing in this space, but also to address some of these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvXYry"&gt;For critics of the company, though, the conversation needs to be much more open than this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield, Neil Jones made the game he always wanted to see</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/88c4FmE85zwBKL75NRXDqmmWEig=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311321/AKNY_SS4.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An explosive and stylish endless runner&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q2ig7J"&gt;Fighting for inclusion within the gaming industry had always been at the forefront of Neil Jones’ heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feR6kv"&gt;The thought of seeing protagonists in video games that looked like him was something that he felt helped elevate the gaming experience to another level, and he knew that was the case for other gamers as well. So, when it came time for Jones to come up with the concept and direction for &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;, he had already decided he would draw from the idea of inclusivity as one of his many forms of inspiration. Jones set out on his lonesome to create a gaming experience and narrative that appealed to players of all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feTnUI"&gt;“A father made a comment on Twitter about how he really enjoyed the game with his son and helping him with the hard levels in the game,” says Jones, a Black game developer and the creator of &lt;em&gt;Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;. “It gave me flashbacks to playing games with my grandma as a kid in Detroit. Growing up, I spent a lot of time outside making up random games to play with other kids who lived around me, as well. I think that’s why I love video games so much; they’re for everyone, and everyone can play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjNjnt"&gt;Born and raised in Detroit, a city with the highest percentage of African Americans in the US, Jones understands the importance of diversity, inclusivity, and representation. Before becoming a full-fledged game developer, Jones got his start working for small app-based studios, mainly specializing in making apps for cars. He also assisted smaller projects with friends, such as &lt;em&gt;Dot’s Home&lt;/em&gt;, a game that explores historical housing injustices faced by Black people, and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/4/20/11461312/clique-game-overview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is aptly described as a game about facing prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gkh0sU"&gt;This work experience furthered Jones’ understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in game development and helped him decide what he would do differently on his own to continue the standard of representation that he achieved through collaboration with his friends. “Representation matters to me because the more we include everyone, the more interesting stories and ideas we have to draw from,” Jones says. “That’s not only for the characters in the games but the members of the development team making the games as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="RjgR2a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFFD6ZPzAdQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ2gjo"&gt;Jones’ mindset stands in direct opposition to that of the gaming industry, which often perpetuates the racial biases that exist outside and inside of the gaming microcosm. These obstacles, unfortunately, lead to little or no Black representation in the games being made and the teams creating them, resulting in Black characters becoming mere stereotypes. Jones actively wanted to work to do his part in remedying this injustice, so when making &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;, he made the conscious decision to work on the project by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="X20Y36"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There really isn’t a team, just me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QM3qxi"&gt;“Some of the biggest obstacles I faced as a Black developer starting out were just being taken seriously and making sure I didn’t let anyone come and try to change the vision of my game’s voice. That’s why I handled everything from even cutting all the trailers myself. There really isn’t a team, just me,” says Jones. “[With] &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; in particular, I didn’t have a hard time with obstacles because I had already given up on pitching games and going that route. So, no major company ended up seeing it ‘til it was halfway done. I don’t think [these gaming companies] would have understood what I was going for without playing it anyway. But [publisher] Headup and their affiliates noticed me during this showcase I was involved in called The Mix. I wasn’t looking for a publisher, but Headup’s email stood out to me, so they ended up helping me with the game towards the end of development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZZGoT"&gt;Much like other independent video games by Black developers, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kaizen_creed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 Force Fighters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1319850/ValiDate_Struggling_Singles_in_your_Area/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ValiDate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jones’ creation of &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; is an enormous deal. It serves as one of the latest steps in an overarching march toward a far more inclusive vision of what gaming, and the gaming industry, should be: diverse stories and narratives for a diverse base of players. And &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; is hoping to be exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRbOQj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; is a 3D side-scrolling endless runner, or “narrative runner,” as Jones passionately calls it, where the player must jump, dash, slide, and race to complete each level. The protagonist is a young Black boy named Wally who has recovered a mysterious artifact from the heart of a Tokyo-styled Detroit that could help save the rest of humanity. Running through a multitude of culturally vibrant environments, Wally must evade obstacles and enemies hell-bent on retrieving this stolen good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1d80oh_P6Ndm2K35_d0KWMvrak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511639/AKNY_SS12__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDOMnt"&gt;“The concept of the game was always to take a cool game mechanic that’s been around for a while and mix it up a bit and really make it my own by adding a lot of styles you wouldn’t normally find in that genre. That’s why I call it a ‘narrative runner.’ The game’s setting has always been based on my weird take on Detroit, but it’s not one-to-one,” says Jones. “Also, I think the main character, Wally, stands out a lot, especially in the indie space, not just because he’s a Black main character but because his story stands out. I hope players have fun piecing together his story and what’s going on in that world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu06hJ"&gt;Fans got a taste of his unique concept in April during the release of the game’s demo. The reaction? An overwhelming amount of anticipation, support, and love. “You are the first dev (to my knowledge) to create a game with a protagonist that looks like my babies,” @DadPadGaming said on Twitter. “Stay strong because you’re showing my kids they can be heroes. #NeverYield #RepresentationMatters.” “You’re doing amazing work! Keep representing us and killing it out here,” says another Twitter user named @L1keMike. “Ignore the haters!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LYP2TZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted anyone, anywhere, to be able to play and enjoy this game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2GKEWe"&gt;Along with his decision to create a game seeped in inclusion, Jones also ensured that this passion project would be a blast to play. Jones states that he wanted to push this particular genre forward with new and exciting gameplay elements and invite players into the genre who may be playing this type of game for the first time. “I added a lot, such as how you control the character, adding a story and cutscenes, progression, and replayability,” Jones says. “People have reached out after playing the demo and said how they don’t normally play these ‘types of games,’ referring to endless runners, but this one really drew them in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1TOEA"&gt;The culturally significant experiences that come with being Black compounded with Jones’ own unique lived experience and development skills shine throughout &lt;em&gt;Never Yield&lt;/em&gt;. These subtleties separate &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; from endless runners of the past and present. It features a well-constructed soundtrack courtesy of Danime-Sama — a Black main character with a prosthetic leg doing parkour — and little to no dialogue, which purposefully shifts the player’s focus toward the design of the game’s culturally rich aesthetics and equally excellent music. “I don’t really care for a lot of dialogue. I wanted anyone, anywhere, to be able to play and enjoy this game, so I tried to do everything in animations,” he says. “My intent with making &lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; was to give myself an opportunity to make something dope that I would have never gotten the opportunity to do otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbrNaO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield&lt;/em&gt; launches on consoles and PCs on May 19th at a turbulent time for the US. The verdict for the George Floyd case has sent shockwaves through the nation, and ignominious acts of police brutality continue to impact African Americans at a disproportionate rate. Jones understands that his game won’t solve major issues on that particular front. Still, he is hopeful that the success of this game will create a moment of solace where players become more curious and interested in exploring Black-led games and become familiar with the lives, experiences, and narratives that come along with the rich cultures of Black people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="r5CokG"&gt;“I’m not sure how or if my game will or can affect the whole industry. That also sounds like it would be a lot of pressure for me or anyone to think about. I just hope enough people buy the game so I can make more of it. If the game does well, then it shows that Black characters actually do sell well,” Jones says. “The climate is definitely wild right now. So, I hope people look at my game and realize that Black talent that’s never been given the opportunity to grow in the games industry; there are so many people that are so much better than me that were never given a chance. I hope that the next wave of Black game devs is given those chances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvOjI3"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Aerial_Knight’s Never Yield &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches May 19th on the Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, and PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Last of Us Part II gets long-awaited 60fps update for PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vsm7rk5JI6DFMPTkAjIWtRLYqcM=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311148/the_last_of_us_state_of_play_screen_02_ps4_us_24sep19.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDQWeD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; is getting a long-awaited PlayStation 5 patch on Wednesday that lets you play the game at a targeted 60fps frame rate, Sony announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="362wXP"&gt;“Once patch 1.08 for &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II &lt;/em&gt;is installed on your PS5, you will find a toggle in the Display options that allows you to choose between a Framerate Target of 30 FPS or 60 FPS,” developer Naughty Dog &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/05/19/the-last-of-us-part-ii-performance-patch-for-ps5/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “This allows you to choose your preferred framerate to complement the rest of the enhancements that are part of the PS5 backward compatibility with PS4 games, such as an enhanced resolution, faster load times, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USw4fL"&gt;You can catch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKTikTO4dE"&gt;a trailer for the patch&lt;/a&gt; at the top of this post, and in my opinion, it looks great. I’ll definitely be checking out the patch myself just to see how the game runs. (Though, I’m not sure I’m ready to put myself through another full playthrough of the grueling but excellent game just yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vk9kia"&gt;If you want to check out a technical deep dive about the patch, &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; has a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aj919idPr18"&gt;nearly 20-minute video testing it out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WblU2C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aj919idPr18?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o8Gf9y"&gt;Sony is also reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375262/sony-remake-the-last-of-us-ps5-studio-reorganization-report"&gt;working on another remake of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this one for the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Imperfect offerings: inside the complex new world of trans tech</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apps lie at the heart of one of the most enduring conflicts in the trans community&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="39D9ad"&gt;In late February, a small company called Euphoria became the day’s main character in trans Twitter circles. The company tweeted an article about their suite of apps — Clarity, Solace, and Bliss — which were designed to be companions for trans people at different points in their transition. Euphoria was announcing a new round of funding from Chelsea Clinton, the Gaingels venture investment syndicate, and other investors, expressing gratitude “for the trust and confidence they’ve placed in us to continue to build more trans tech.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIEeZk"&gt;The company had received very little engagement on Twitter until then. But that tweet in particular gained traction, with hundreds of people quote-tweeting to dunk on the company’s products, calling them grifts or “woke capital” and urging people to seek out community to meet their needs rather than downloading the apps. Trans artist Matt Lubchansky tweeted “my brain is in hell” alongside screenshots of the Euphoria and Gaingels Twitter profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOb0PE"&gt;The apps themselves, sleek and butterfly-themed, look fairly innocuous. The Clarity app consists of three sliders, for gender identity, expression, and attraction, to track a person’s sense of self from day to day. Solace is a sort of guidebook to transition, with goals to choose from and information on a wide variety of transition-related topics. Bliss hasn’t launched yet but will be a savings and financial planning app for transition goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwwGGz"&gt;Most critics were skeptical: were these apps data-mining scams? Were they made to replace the function of trans communities? Because so many trans people are rejected both from family and from wider society, community ties are often critical for guidance, support, and survival. “This is yet another product to replace community, giving tips and helpful goals for all things trans, without ever needing to talk to another person,” said trans writer Niko Stratis. “I cannot stress enough that these are all things you can get from community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A butterfly logo with a blue to pink gradient above the word Solace and a log in button.

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Solace login page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X6gWoY"&gt;Other startups for trans people received similar pushback. Plume (which Euphoria partners with) and Folx are both subscription-based hormone services that faced scrutiny from people skeptical of venture capital solutions to health care disparities. Folx has &lt;a href="https://www.folxhealth.com/library/folx-vc-funded"&gt;an entire page&lt;/a&gt; in its FAQ section titled “Yes, Folx is VC-Funded.” There’s even a highlighted segment — “Venture capital is one of the few avenues available to take the risks necessary to tear down the current system and build anew” — that calls to mind a familiar question for queer people. How can someone dismantle a system while operating within its parameters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQtqDl"&gt;Twitter users don’t reflect the entire human population,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but the argument that played out was a microcosm of a larger historical conflict within queer communities. Some people want to assimilate into dominant society while others seek to liberate themselves from it entirely. That tension has been present for decades, as gay rights gained mainstream attention and pride events turned from political rallies to corporate-sponsored parades. Some trans people will accept, happily or begrudgingly,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;whatever tools might make their lives easier, while others reject solutions that are entangled in the same structures that have kept them ground down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmRyyu"&gt;For a population that is consistently rendered socially, financially, and politically powerless, it can feel insulting to be offered a product sanctioned by the society that has robbed them of their power. Trans people who reacted with anger and disbelief to Euphoria’s offerings are coming from years of distrust for anything that bypasses community building in favor of the whims of investors and marketers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sc23wq"&gt;Trans people live with constant uncertainty. Compared to the general population, trans people, especially trans women of color, are significantly &lt;a href="https://transequality.org/issues/resources/national-transgender-discrimination-survey-full-report"&gt;more susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to discrimination and violence and experience higher rates of &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-poverty-us/"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-homelessness-us/"&gt;homelessness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/suicidality-transgender-adults/"&gt;suicidal thoughts&lt;/a&gt;. Many don’t have even basic health care, let alone insurance that will cover hormone therapy or surgeries. Wave after wave of &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/over-half-of-us-states-tried-passing-anti-trans-bills-2021-3"&gt;proposed legislation&lt;/a&gt; threatens to strip away rights, from bathroom bills to laws severely restricting young trans people’s access to gender affirming health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IrsvI"&gt;At the same time, trans people are the latest population to become marketable, targeted with rainbow products and boilerplate statements from brands that offer validation through consumerism. While trans people struggle to be more than the most frequently ignored letter of “LGBT,” corporations want to &lt;a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/why-marketers-must-evolve-their-outlook-on-gender-or-lose-out/572584/"&gt;flaunt their trans acceptance&lt;/a&gt; to both cis and trans consumers. Communities cobble together mutual aid funds for housing, transportation, and health care while startups like Folx, Plume, and Euphoria attract attention from investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQZPrt"&gt;Robbi Katherine Anthony, or RKA, one of Euphoria’s founders, developed the apps after reflecting on her own transition, which she describes as a rocky road. She says that one of the Solace entries, titled “Loving Yourself,” is a love letter to her former self, telling other trans people the things she wishes she could have heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cILKtj"&gt;When she tried to research for certain goals early in her transition, she would find an abundance of conflicting information. It took her years to start hormone therapy, partly because “if I had to have 50 tabs open and cross reference against all of them to find the kernel of truth, I usually just kind of took a break from it, because it was so stressful.” She and her co-founder decided to start making apps with the goal to “make transition suck less.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBa0Rw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I see us as a complimentary effort rather than an extinction event”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L4VKUC"&gt;RKA easily brushed off the Twitter kerfuffle. “There’s a contingent of people in the trans community that are very, very opposed to capitalism, companies, for-profit services,” she says, “and will just stake out opposition to anything of that nature.” For her, claims that the apps seek to replace networks of community care don’t hold much water. She wants Solace to be one solution among many for trans people. Some people will still want to be involved in their communities and go to support groups, she says, “and as long as we don’t preclude anyone from doing that, I see us as a complimentary effort rather than an extinction event, if you will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCPskR"&gt;For her transition, RKA preferred to do things solo rather than trying to find a community of other trans people. “At the end of the day, I’m just looking for a conformist experience,” she says. “I’m just looking to blend in. And so the idea of being part of a community felt almost opposed to my transition goals.” The apps cater to people who feel similarly, and the majority of Solace users prefer the app to community functions, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmQywS"&gt;Angry tweets aside, RKA says the overall response to the apps has been positive. She says surveys have shown that users find transitioning more achievable with Solace in their pocket. Most importantly, she says the company receives thousands of messages and emails from users saying their suicidal ideation has decreased. “I have had suicidal thoughts pertaining to body dysphoria, but Solace helps me realize I can’t give up,” reads one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A word bubble that says “Hey friend! It’s good to see you, [name]. How can I help today?” The bubble is coming from a circle that is pink in the center with concentric circles that become blue at the edge. Underneath is a simple illustration of a mountaintop with a trans flag at the top, labeled “goals and progress.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DsHxj9y80uojwL_4Fe_p1k7z7wY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512159/IMG_5488.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The homepage of the Solace app, where users can choose goals, track progress, and read a curated news feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUgQD0"&gt;Lilly DeLoe, who uses Solace, turned to books, internet digging, and chats with friends to find information about transition. But she says Solace was the first resource that offered “some semblance of a roadmap with a reasonable amount of variability in regards to possibilities for transition.” Like RKA, she didn’t entirely trust forums because the information shared in them could be inaccurate or overly specific to individual people. She’s been using Solace for about eight months and is amazed at the progress she’s made in her transition goals in that time. She had held off on transitioning for a long time, but she says if a comprehensive resource like Solace had existed 20 years ago, “I wouldn’t have waited until I was 39 to transition. I wouldn’t have lost 20 years of my life, pretending to be someone I wasn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRgCeE"&gt;Still, others are concerned that the apps signal a concerning shift toward individual-based solutions to the symptoms, rather than the causes, of inequality, and a shift away from the communal care that has often been central to trans people’s lives. Euphoria’s products are another individualized approach to the massive gaps in US health care, one of many opportunities for capitalism to pat itself on the back for addressing problems it causes, says Zein Murib, assistant professor of political science at Fordham University. People with political or financial power back apps and hormone delivery services without actually changing the system that makes gender confirmation care unobtainable in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRV6rm"&gt;It makes sense that people pushed back against a set of venture-backed apps that aim to solve trans people’s complex problems, Murib says. Turning to venture capital is contrary to many trans people’s desire to escape profit-based systems that have kept them marginalized by deeming them unprofitable for companies and therefore worthless. Any product that pitches itself as a guidebook for transition, no matter how nuanced and flexible, can be perceived as a call to assimilate, both into cisnormative society and the capitalist system that comes with it. “I’m not surprised that there was this big Twitter response by people saying, on one hand, not only do they not want to assimilate,” says Murib, “but also from a lot of people saying, ‘what if I can’t assimilate?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu8OrV"&gt;Solace is clear that its listed goals are not the be-all, end-all of transition, that everyone’s transition will be different and there’s no single correct way to be trans. But it still echoes white, middle class, and cisnormative ideals of what transness looks like, says Chris Barcelos, assistant professor of women’s, gender, and sexuality Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Solace is also hindered by the word count of its entries; picking and choosing which complexities are worth mentioning in its introductory summaries of topics that could (and do) fill books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A list of goals including: coming out to family, coming out to friends, coping and confronting harassment and discrimination, coping with infidelity, creating a hidden photo vault, dating and sex, and dealing with being misgendered. The misgendered goal appears twice." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f-sEYumbX7lSfRIsaMhKwgAQ6iU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512207/IMG_5489.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are over 150 goals in the Solace app, divided into legal, lifestyle, and medical. (Duplicate goals appear if the user chooses “they” pronouns because the app presents masculine and feminine versions.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wyqxhG"&gt;Several people pointed out that Solace is more focused on people of binary genders — woman or man — with little inclusion of nonbinary people. Binary transition narratives are usually the most palatable to cis people, and people who fall outside of that binary are often stung by the feeling that they’re an afterthought in mainstream discussions of transness, leading to tension not just between cis and trans people, but also between binary and nonbinary trans people. “We look at transgender men and transgender women as our greatest point of focus,” says RKA, “because that’s the largest chasm to cross.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV72no"&gt;The Solace app understands transition through consumption: buy these clothes, get these surgeries, and you’ll be successfully trans, says Barcelos. Even in the goals that aren’t about consumption, the app tries to quantify things that can’t be easily distilled into a checklist, Barcelos says. Checking off goals along the path of transition can be incredibly meaningful for someone like DeLoe, but Barcelos and Murib both argue that self-surveillance and constant tracking could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72isab"&gt;The apps are pitched together for a fixed timeline of transition. Use Clarity when you’re figuring yourself out, use Solace to identify and learn about your goals, and use Bliss to help achieve them. But transition is rarely one continuous path. Many people are out in some spaces and not others, have to stop their hormones for long stretches of time, or put off gender-affirming procedures. Some trans people have no plans to ever medically transition, or see transness as a space for experimentation with no end goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gn852a"&gt;“Part of what contributes to transphobia and trans oppression is these essential ideas of ‘this is what trans means, this is what transition means, this is how you know you’ve completed it,’” says Barcelos. “And I think it’s dangerous to take that up and implement it in our own communities.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phAVqm"&gt;Beyond the substance of the app itself,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;many of Euphoria’s critics took issue with the overall framing that a guide to transition is a novel idea. Trans people have been seeking and sharing information among their communities for ages. Zines like Lou Sullivan’s &lt;em&gt;Information for the female-to-male crossdresser and transsexual &lt;/em&gt;circulated in queer social networks in the ‘80s. There were online message boards in the ‘90s. Nowadays, people turn to Discord groups, subreddits, Facebook groups, and other online forums to seek advice and find affirmation. One of the frequent calls in response to the Euphoria tweet was “if you have questions about transition, don’t download an app, DM me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A slider labeled “Gender identity?” has female at the left end and male at the right end. Below the slider is text that says “Gender identity is: A person’s innate sense of having a particular gender, which may or may not correspond with one’s natal sex. Think about this as the default way you think of yourself. The person you are around others and when you are by yourself. There isn’t a right or wrong answer here." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3K5mFS9W2tE-L9fQ2YuKi25ghrc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512161/IMG_5492.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Euphoria&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first slider in the Clarity app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6OKKoJ"&gt;Even before making the decision to socially or medically transition, many people turn to peers, rather than sliders on an app, for help sorting out their feelings about their identity. Transness is often explored not just in self-reflection but in conversation. “A lot of trans experience is communal,” says Alyssa Videlock, who moderates several trans-specific subreddits and Discord groups. She finds joy in helping other trans people find validation during their first moments of exploration. “They come into it and they leave with a sense of self that they didn’t have before,” she says. “Getting them to a point where they can say, ‘I’m more solid in the identity that makes me happy.’ It makes me happy to see, even if they choose not to do anything about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGKq1V"&gt;Before she started transitioning, Kath Bigfrog, another moderator of trans groups, traveled with two other trans women to the apartment of Rita Hester, the Black trans woman whose murder sparked Transgender Day of Remembrance. They brought flowers and held a small vigil. It was in that moment, full of emotion, that Bigfrog decided, “I have to do this, I have to transition and be who I’m supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SsdJhI"&gt;“Part of the problem is you can’t really make a comprehensive resource, because so much of trans community and trans history is just things that you can’t put in a guidebook,” says Bigfrog. (&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: In the interest of full disclosure, I met and became friends with Bigfrog through one of the groups she moderates.) &lt;/em&gt;She points out that Solace actively discourages people from seeking hormones on the “grey market,” a term used for trans people sharing hormones within their communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjmFpB"&gt;Taking hormones without the guidance of a doctor can be dangerous, but trans people have a long history of sharing hormones because so few have access to gender-affirming care. There are often self-taught experts within communities who guide other trans people through hormone regimens. Euphoria’s discouragement is well-intentioned, and a smart choice to avoid liability, but the framing of its advice is aggravating for many trans people who have struggled to navigate a health care system that is so often hostile, even harmful, to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fd5zKn"&gt;“If you don’t trust medical providers, you should strongly reconsider your position even if only as a matter of personal health and preservation,” says the Solace entry about the grey market. This call to action doesn’t acknowledge why many trans people are distrustful of established medical systems, assuming they can access them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlm4d4"&gt;Faced with a history of medicine that has pathologized and traumatized them, trans people find medical advice in surprising places.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“I’ve seen a bunch of posts from the same person [on Lex, a queer dating app] that are just like, ‘Oh, thanks for all the help with top surgery shit’,” says Bigfrog. “You could literally just log on to Lex and be like, ‘I want to get top surgery’ and you’ll get a bunch of gay people in your DMs telling you where to go and what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="loklSA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is a bit of a cultural rub going on”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pTymnm"&gt;DeLoe approaches the apps from a pragmatic viewpoint. Maybe venture capital isn’t the best answer to trans people’s problems, but she at least had a concrete resource she could use to teach her therapist about transness. It’s hard to see Solace as a grift when it has materially improved the lives of DeLoe and others like her. The app is, instead, another incomplete solution that highlights the precariousness and desperation of trans existence, a response to the difficulties of life within an unjust society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNO5fs"&gt;“There is a bit of a cultural rub going on right now in which solutions have to be perfect for everyone to be seen as worthwhile,” says RKA. “But in some sense, that’s a really ineffective way to make change. Because the suggestion is, don’t do anything until it’s perfect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73GdQi"&gt;There are no perfect solutions as long as transphobia is rampant and health care remains a nightmare. Even successful fundraisers for trans medical care, tangible demonstrations of community power, are tangled up in internalized biases. The crowdfunding campaigns that raise the most money are usually for young white men, and campaign descriptions are often constricted to normative understandings of transness, echoing “wrong body” narratives that appeal to cis people. “We’re both caring for each other by circulating the same $20 around in trans communities,” says Barcelos, “but also complicit in larger patterns of inequality.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uWownw"&gt;Euphoria, with its imperfect offerings, puts forth options for people who prefer to transition on their own or who are exhausted at the idea of trawling through forums to find pearls of wisdom. But community conversations, online or in person, leave room for complexity and experimentation. It’s among communities that people are able to explore their identities in more expansive terms than simplified Gender 101, where people organize calls to their representatives, discuss how much they’re willing to assimilate, strategize about fundraising, laugh, and mourn. Of her trip to Hester’s apartment, Bigfrog says, “That sort of camaraderie you can’t get from an app, you know? You ain’t sobbing over flowers with the sliders or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rNa2z5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s Streambar&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few double-duty soundbars out there that can also connect to your TV to stream TV shows and movies in 4K HDR from all sorts of services, like Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and more. If that sounds appealing to you, this compact 14-inch soundbar is just $100 at a variety of retailers today, costing $30 less than usual. The Streambar has four full-range drivers, and on its back is an HDMI port, an optical audio port, and a USB port. This soundbar can be wall mounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Z59pO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10488551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WYMRX4"&gt;Acer’s excellent 13.5-inch 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 713 &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740999584841405951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740999584841405951#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;s $429 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, down from $629. My colleague Monica Chin rates the Spin 713 as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best Chromebook you can currently buy&lt;/a&gt; because of its 3:2 aspect ratio QHD display, a backlit keyboard that’s comfortable to type on, and a processor capable of handling a heavy load of tabs with no slowdown. We’ve occasionally seen it sell for $529, but this is a much better deal that seems to be exclusive to Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vi69Sq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxArUu"&gt;If you’re a Costco member, you can get a good deal on the Apple Watch SE. This model usually sells for $270, but members can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/apple-watch-se-40mm-gps.product.100457716.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm model with GPS connectivity for $240&lt;/a&gt;. This $30 price cut might not be worth getting a membership for on its own, but current Costco shoppers might want to check this deal out.

    <title>Lofelt’s new haptics framework is ready to bring good vibrations to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm Lofelt" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owHO1DVBrVcpvFHKo7sgIRSPo2o=/69x0:807x492/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310907/0_66eU5_KB84vIXV7A.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lofelt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htfuLm"&gt;Haptic feedback on Android phones is usually terrible, at least compared to devices that have Apple’s Taptic Engine. You know it, I know it, and a haptics company called Lofelt apparently knows it, too. Today, though, Lofelt, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;partnership with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s making its VTX haptic framework available to OEMs, with the hope that these manufacturers will start putting better haptics into more Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeMuxB"&gt;The framework will allow OEMs to utilize high-definition haptic vibration on phones running the latest Snapdragon 8-series and 7-series without any hardware tweaks. The system is “tightly integrated with Snapdragon and fully validated by Qualcomm,” according to Lofelt. While the framework is technically compatible with older phones that have a Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series chipset, it’s at the discretion of each OEM whether to add support. It seems more likely that companies will make the big effort to implement improved haptics in upcoming phones than adding it to older models. As for which newer models will feature the framework, none have been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNU9eK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VTX comes with “no performance trade-offs,” says Lofelt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsR6Fl"&gt;Ahead of this announcement, I got to actually feel the difference myself that Lofelt’s improved haptics can make on a phone through software tweaks only. The company sent over a custom Google Pixel 4 packed with demos that show off how its vibrations feel compared to the stock Android implementation (the same setup can’t be duplicated on other devices). Compared to phones designed to take full advantage of Lofelt VTX’s integration with the chipset, this Pixel 4 was running the haptics tricks through the application layer as a proof of concept. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m54Hgt2LU3SXibxUiEMAat33Vzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522947/lofelttoggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lofelt’s app let me feel the difference between stock Android vibrations and the company’s own — and the difference was noticeable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2vih4G"&gt;Each of the demos featured a toggle that lets you switch between the stock Android vibration and Lofelt’s refined haptics, as shown in the bottom right of the picture above. One instance ran through a few scenarios in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. The vibrations varied in strength and duration depending on the kind of gun being shot, and I was able to feel distinct pulsations of a helicopter soaring through the sky. A demo for &lt;em&gt;Asphalt 9: Legends&lt;/em&gt; let me feel the roar of an engine through haptics, as well as the fast, crunchy pulsing of the vibration motor when the car ran over a dirt median. Even though the Pixel 4 and earlier models don’t natively support VTX, these demos were far more expressive than standard Android phone vibrations. If you’re someone who takes mobile gaming seriously, to the point of owning something like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi controller&lt;/a&gt;, haptics could make your favorite games feel more immersive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPUkDo"&gt;The big challenge for Lofelt isn’t in proving that these sorts of immersive haptic experiences are worth building (give the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lofelt-studio/id1482238306"&gt;Lofelt Studio app for iOS&lt;/a&gt; a try if you need convincing yourself). The real work is ensuring that as many phones as possible can eventually get them, and that it won’t take too much effort for developers. That’s where Lofelt’s AX (adaptive experience) signal processing tech built into VTX comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0AHjL"&gt;According to Lofelt, AX converts a universal haptic signal into vibrations that play to the strengths of each individual phone, taking into consideration its haptics driver, actuator hardware, and control algorithms from the manufacturer. The goal is for Android devices to catch up to Apple’s excellent Taptic Engine that’s in modern iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Older phones with the Snapdragon 7-series and 8-series can be updated as OEMs see fit, but you’ll likely find better haptics in new phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LNUdA2"&gt;App and game developers can design advanced haptics using Lofelt Studio, which integrates with Unity, Unreal, and Xcode, and create a universal .haptic file that works across multiple devices. According to Lofelt, these files contain “universal parameters, such as whether the haptics should include smooth, continuous signals or more punchy, dynamic events.” In other words, you’ll only need to build it once, then the framework can deliver a consistent experience across different phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bERQJA"&gt;Existing games and apps running on supported Snapdragon hardware won’t be left in the dust. Lofelt claims that framework will also be able to convert the audio stream coming from an app into vibrations in real time without any hardware or coding modifications. So, you won’t necessarily need to wait for every developer to create bespoke haptics in order to start feeling some tactile enhancements with apps you already know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3gtcJ"&gt;Lofelt says that its VTX framework comes with no performance trade-offs, and that it aims to deliver better haptics “while minimizing the impact on battery and actuator.” That sounds great, and the demo I tried feels ready for deployment. But now, the wait begins for some phone manufacturers to kickstart what could be a big, positive change for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are uncomfortable with digital health tools used to control COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3GDGazX19HQe0rdDrH0m93t-Fg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310908/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Bb4sh"&gt;Most people in the United States don’t want their digital data used to control the spread of COVID-19, a &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.10918?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=051921"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found. More than half of the people in the study remained wary of sharing their data in different scenarios, including a smart thermometer company sharing information with public health officials, or using the Google and Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222161/apple-google-bluetooth-contact-tracing-system-coronavirus-health"&gt;exposure notification app&lt;/a&gt; to track infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgKd6k"&gt;“I was surprised a bit about the degree of skepticism when the potential benefits are so high,” says study author David Grande, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vaGiT"&gt;Grande and his team collected survey responses from 3,547 US adults during July 2020 about their attitudes toward the use of digital information to respond to the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5LeGJ"&gt;The survey asked whether or not they approved of using aggregated data pulled from social media to set health policies or contact people for COVID-19 testing. It asked whether they were okay with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;data from smart thermometers being used for either health policies or contact tracing. It asked about three versions of the Google and Apple exposure notification app: one where using the app and any data sharing with health officials is optional; a second where using the app is optional but it automatically shares data with health officials; and a third where the app is mandatory. Finally, it asked whether people approved of the use of cellphone data to enforce quarantine and identify people at high risk for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4ymnU"&gt;The lowest support was for monitoring social media to set health policies — only 28 percent of people approved or strongly approved of that scenario. The highest level of support was for a version of the Google and Apple exposure notification app where use was optional but information was shared with health officials, of which 43 percent of people approved or strongly approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8m3uim"&gt;Grande thinks people may be more interested in the exposure notification app than official use of social media data because they get a more direct benefit, even though it’s a more invasive tool. “Some of the other uses, people may think, ‘I’m contributing my data for the common good but how is it going to protect me as an individual?’” he says. A tool that was developed to tell people if they’ve been exposed to a virus may seem worth the trade-offs around privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AWtTys"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Everyone was facing massive disruption in their lives. I thought that people would be more accepting” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Azr5PQ"&gt;Still, that program only had explicit support from less than half of the people surveyed, even though the survey went out just as the country was coming out of the first wave of COVID-19 and lockdowns. “Everyone was facing massive disruption in their lives,” Grande says. “I thought that people would be more accepting.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxuQEM"&gt;Having personal experience with COVID-19, like a family member getting the disease, didn’t impact people’s approval of these tools, the study found. Neither did living in an area with high rates of COVID-19. People who were politically conservative, though, were less likely to support the use of digital data to manage COVID-19 than people who were liberal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CimmVB"&gt;In general, people tend to be worried when they start hearing about the collection and use of health data, Grande says. Their personal digital data might already be collected by companies and used for things like advertising, but it might not be as apparent — and they’re not asked direct questions about it. People also don’t realize that virtually all of the data collected by companies can be analyzed to infer things about health, like their mood or behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nJoW3"&gt;“I suspect that if we ask people direct questions about many commercial uses of their data that are currently taking place, we would see much greater resistance to those,” Grande says. “It’s just that many of those other uses aren’t so visible to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLrzAC"&gt;The results of the study show that if they want people to use digital tools, public health officials will have to underscore the privacy protections that they have in place, and point out the direct benefits for users. A large chunk of people who responded to the survey said that they neither agreed nor disagreed with the use of data in the various scenarios — a sign that they could be persuaded. If most of that group backed something like the exposure notification app, officials would have close to two-thirds of people in support, Grande says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6D2ZT"&gt;“Through effective policies and communication, I think we can convince people that — assuming that protections are in place — these are a good idea,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chipset will put premium features in midrange phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpeqS7-xZs5K93r7a7GER8zE018=/0x0:895x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310906/Under_Embargo___Snapdragon_778G_Press_Note_Final_11__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qualcomm’s 700-series Snapdragon chipsets are popular among midrange and premium midrange phone manufacturers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dHT4li"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a new 700-series chipset for mobile devices: the Snapdragon 778G 5G. It will start appearing in premium midrange phones from manufacturers including Motorola, Xiaomi, Realme, Honor, Oppo, and iQOO in the next few months, bringing with it some video capture and AI capabilities borrowed from the Snapdragon 888, the current chipset of choice for flagship Android phones. The company has also made a couple of other announcements today designed to get 5G connectivity into more tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mhwNy"&gt;The Snapdragon 778G offers three image-signal processors, or ISPs — a feature Qualcomm touted in its flagship 888 chipset, and also appears in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;higher-end 780G&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it possible to capture photos and video from three different cameras at once. You can easily switch between different cameras’ video feeds during recording ala &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/mobile-devices/control-your-shots-with-directors-view-on-galaxy-s21-series/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s director view&lt;/a&gt; on the Snapdragon 888-powered S21 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgzGLZ"&gt;The processor also supports cameras with staggered HDR sensors like the 50-megapixel chip in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; for better HDR video recording. The 778G also includes some improvements for more GPU-efficient mobile gaming, and things like better noise suppression and camera experiences on video calls. Both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G are supported, as well as Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PGoBr"&gt;In “more 5G in more places” news, Qualcomm is also making M.2 reference designs available for current OEM customers of its X65 and X62 5G modems. This makes it easier for laptop, desktop, gaming, and IoT manufacturers to incorporate 5G connectivity into their products. The company is also debuting a new X65 5G modem, which Qualcomm says is more energy efficient and offers wider support of mmWave frequencies. It will start appearing in commercial mobile devices later this year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify enters the virtual concert business, starts selling $15 tickets to events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jDAwIgkefm7JvFJkkJxkqe0VPY=/0x0:1227x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69310892/spotifylivestream.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify is hosting virtual, prerecorded concerts starting in May.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQywgq"&gt;Spotify is entering the virtual concert business, just as in-person concerts are becoming more of a possibility. The company &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that people can now buy tickets to five different concert streams, which will air throughout May and June. Initial artists include The Black Keys, Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, and Leon Bridges. The streams all are prerecorded but can only be viewed at a given time through the web browser. The shows aren’t available on demand, and they aren’t accessible through the Spotify app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79LZSv"&gt;Tickets cost $15, and viewers must have a Spotify account to watch the show. (Viewers can set up a free Spotify account during the ticket-buying process if they don’t already have one.) You can check out the &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.live/faq"&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; for more details, but notably, tickets are tied to individual users’ accounts, so they’re non-transferable, and if you end up missing the show, you can’t get a refund. (Spotify says each artist’s recording will air at four different times to account for the world’s various timezones, so buyers have to select their preferred time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRS7CL"&gt;Spotify previously participated in the concert ecosystem by allowing artists to list shows through its app and link out to ones from specific partners, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15810710/spotify-eventbrite-integration-concert-recommendations"&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, the company said it &lt;a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-generated-40m-in-ticket-sales-last-year-now-its-accelerating-its-presence-in-live-music/"&gt;generated more than&lt;/a&gt; $40 million in ticket sales through its Fans First program, which gives fans extra perks, like early access to tickets. It also hosted its own in-person events tied to its playlist branding, including Rap Caviar and Viva Latino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fAodK"&gt;During the pandemic, the company started listing virtual concerts, too. Fifteen dollars for these prerecorded concerts feels a bit steep, especially because it isn’t much different than live sets you can likely find from late-night shows or other specials for free on YouTube or Instagram Live, but it seems like Spotify is trying to find a new revenue stream and way to keep fans engaged during a time when most have been disconnected from the idea of live music. It’s unclear if the company intends to keep up the virtual concert series. For now, these five shows are all the commitment we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyTbmr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
