    <title>Apple reportedly sends warning letter to Chinese leaker</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bH10md"&gt;Despite Apple’s efforts to keep anyone from finding out what it’s working on, leaks have continued to give the world early previews of new iPhones, Macs and more. Its campaign to plug the holes is apparently extending to threats of legal action, as the leaker known as “Kang” &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1694917363/KlE4Ozlsd?from=page_1005051694917363_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;ssl_rnd=1624542267.3793&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;posted to Weibo&lt;/a&gt; this week about a notice he received from the company (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/reliable-leaker-kang-hit-with-warning/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEq4Ok"&gt;Kang currently holds the &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/kang/"&gt;number one spot on the AppleTrack leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to compare the reliability of the information various leakers share, and &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-targets-leakers-and-collaborators-in-new-offensive-to-stop-rumors/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost"&gt;AppleTrack indicates&lt;/a&gt; that other leakers have received similar messages. Prior to the iPhone 12 launch, Kang posted about all four models that Apple had prepared, revealing their prices, colors and planned release dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WelwFO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 12: everything we think we know about Apple’s 2020 5G iPhones, which could be announced on October 13th ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21423811/apple-iphone-12-max-pro-leaks-rumors-specs-design-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FLVL0Q"&gt;According to Kang, the letter from a law firm claimed that his actions could share information with Apple’s competitors, or mislead consumers about devices that aren’t coming. It also included screenshots of his Weibo page, showing posts beyond the leaks, like ones where he talked about problems he’s had with Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKPO8n"&gt;For his part, Kang claims to have never signed an NDA, published undisclosed pictures or profited from his information. Still, the tracker shows his information has revealed details about everything from the iPhone SE to the HomePod mini. Content creator Ben Geskin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenGeskin/status/1408121541150269446"&gt;mentioned receiving&lt;/a&gt; a similar notice last year, while fellow leaker L0vetodream (number five on the source ranking list) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/L0vetodream/status/1408018049102356484"&gt;said they had not received anything&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnVfPT"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the letters or how many were sent. As for Kang, the post indicates he won’t post “riddles” or “dreams” about upcoming devices, so while the weight of the threat is unclear, it may have had Apple’s intended effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says its own customer support tools were compromised by the SolarWinds hackers</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="dIqS0m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/06/25/new-nobelium-activity/"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; some of its customer support tools were accessed by &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/21/december-21st-2020-solorigate-resource-center/"&gt;the hacking group Nobelium&lt;/a&gt;, which was also connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;the SolarWinds attacks&lt;/a&gt;, due to a Microsoft customer service agent’s computer being compromised. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-says-new-breach-discovered-probe-suspected-solarwinds-hackers-2021-06-25/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the agent had limited access, and was able to see things like what services customers used, and their billing contact information. According to Microsoft, the hackers used the info gleaned from the tools to start “highly targeted” attacks on specific Microsoft customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QeLAA"&gt;The attacks, Microsoft says, were part of a larger Nobelium campaign largely focused on IT companies and governments throughout the world. The company says it’s reached out to the customers who were impacted by the hacking group’s use of the tools, and that Nobelium no longer has access to the customer support agent’s device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jn2Cd"&gt;Microsoft has talked about security a lot today, especially in relation to its upcoming Windows 11, as the company tries to make the case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;requiring users to have specific hardware&lt;/a&gt; in order to upgrade. Incidents like these, where one compromised computer could give hackers a head start on future attacks, are illustrative of the cat-and-mouse game that Microsoft plays with those looking to breach its security.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know about the Pentagon’s UFO report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGjUQ6Q1lGKJM1OZDqPTf7C6PMo=/0x251:1454x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504421/Screen_Shot_2021_06_25_at_7.57.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Department of Defense/US Navy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For those who feel abducted by the recent UFO hype, this one’s for you &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Jz1cto"&gt;A highly anticipated report on the Pentagon’s research into Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), aka UFOs, was released today. It contains some very limited information from the Pentagon’s new UAP task force, which examines unknown objects through a national security lens. The Defense Department said last year it takes “any incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace very seriously...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMQQlN"&gt;The government’s UAP program and the report have spawned a news cycle that has shot UFO conspiracies back into the mainstream. Despite the hype, the report absolutely does not contain proof of aliens. Here’s what we know so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9roQWH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When will this Pentagon UFO report come out? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg1oZr"&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee squeezed in a comment within last year’s massive COVID-19 relief bill that &lt;a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/intelligence-authorization-act-fiscal-year-2021"&gt;asked the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; to cough up classified and unclassified versions of a UAP report in 180 days, or no later than Friday, June 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okuJcb"&gt;The nine-page report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550575/pentagon-ufo-uap-unclassified-report-congress"&gt;is now available online&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F4tL0R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UAP? Why not say UFO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFPuor"&gt;They’re basically the same thing. UAP stands for unidentified aerial phenomena, which is a new fancy way of saying unidentified flying objects. Naming a Pentagon program after UFOs would be far too silly for a big, very serious government intelligence program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7bg1E"&gt;More seriously, putting “objects” in the name could be too limiting of a word for a program that deals with the unknown. Can we really consider them “objects” if we’re only seeing strange shapes through fuzzy camera footage from military aircraft? “Phenomena” would be a bit more accurate. It’s defined as “a fact or situation that is observed to exist or happen, especially one whose cause or explanation is in question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G8TULb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did this start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cwgFOk"&gt;Depends on how far back you want to go. The US has dabbled in UFO research for decades, and various documents have been made public over the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0j299"&gt;The Air Force had &lt;a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/military/air-force/ufos"&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/a&gt;, which closed in 1969 after investigating more than 12,500 UFO sightings. The CIA &lt;a href="https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/ufos-the-central-intelligence-agency-cia-collection/"&gt;dumped a trove&lt;/a&gt; of historical UFO records in January, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdqjy/you-can-now-easily-download-all-cia-ufo-documents-to-date"&gt;revealing&lt;/a&gt; more government attempts to explain unidentified aerial phenomena in the years following Project Blue Book’s end. None of these historical records link any unexplained phenomena to extraterrestrial activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hqSxxI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pentagon takes UAP “incursions... very seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m9Tjnn"&gt;The government says it’s generally interested in UAPs / UFOs out of national security concerns. In one statement from August last year, the Defense Department said it takes “any incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace very seriously and examine each report. This includes examinations of incursions that are initially reported as UAP when the observer cannot immediately identify what he or she is observing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5l4Vw"&gt;Public fascination with UFOs generally &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/the-man-who-introduced-the-world-to-flying-saucers/372732/"&gt;dates back to 1947&lt;/a&gt;, when an amateur pilot flying his plane near Mount Rainier in Washington state reported sights of nine “saucer-like” objects darting across the sky. His recollection of what he saw spawned &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080413203646/http://www.mimufon.org/historical_folders/nicap_pages/ReportOnWaveOf1947.pdf"&gt;a wave of press attention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ckR4Fi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how did the most recent round of UFO... sorry — UAP — discourse start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HA6AJt"&gt;It started in 2017, when stories published by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/16/pentagon-ufo-search-harry-reid-216111/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a classified Pentagon project that began in 2007 to investigate unidentified phenomena and ended in 2012. Formally established under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and later transferred to the Defense Department’s headquarters, it was reportedly run primarily by former military intelligence official Luis Elizondo, who has said he resigned in 2017 over what he considered internal opposition to government-funded UAP research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhmAh3"&gt;(It’s worth noting that both the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reports have been criticized as being credulous toward &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/01/ufo-unidentified-history-channel-luis-elizondo-pentagon/"&gt;Elizondo’s claims&lt;/a&gt; and overly accepting of the remote possibility that UAPs can be attributed to alien activity. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22463659/ufo-videos-navy-alien-drone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of laying out some of the surrounding context and is worth a read.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxFtKJ"&gt;AATIP also gathered studies on wild ideas straight out of science fiction, from nuclear propulsion to invisibility cloaking, warp drives, metallic glasses, programmable matter, etc., &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18187178/pentagon-research-documents-invisibility-cloaking-wormholes-warp-drive-department-of-defense"&gt;according to a list&lt;/a&gt; of AATIP research products that was sent to Congress in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Former US Sen. Harry Reid&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UYY26K"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reports, AATIP’s initial “black” budget of $22 million — a minuscule amount compared to other Pentagon budgets — was pushed by former Nevada senator and space phenomena enthusiast Harry Reid. Most of that funding reportedly went to a Las Vegas-based space company owned by hotel chain magnate and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow, a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22463659/ufo-videos-navy-alien-drone"&gt;campaign donor&lt;/a&gt; to and longtime friend of Reid. Bigelow told the&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;that his company, Bigelow Aerospace, modified storage buildings at its headquarters to make room for mysterious “metal alloys” that were recovered during work on the AATIP contract. Though the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; never attributed the alloys’ origins to aliens, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-those-alien-alloys-in-the-new-york-times-ufo-story/"&gt;the claim also received criticism&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing on these alloys has been revealed since. Bigelow hasn’t talked publicly about them since his interview with the&lt;em&gt; Times, &lt;/em&gt;and a Freedom of Information Act request filed to the DIA in early 2018 remains open with no records turned over (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jt9sQX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwTIZf"&gt;While AATIP is now defunct, it has a successor. In June 2020, the Senate Intelligence Committee &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgx573/senate-intelligence-committee-confirms-the-us-navy-has-a-ufo-task-force"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the existence of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, situated within the Office of Naval Intelligence. The Pentagon &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2314065/establishment-of-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-task-force/"&gt;confirmed and announced&lt;/a&gt; the task force a few months later, describing in a statement the body’s mission “to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” Last December, the intelligence committee gave the Pentagon six months to produce a report detailing the task force’s findings on UAPs. That’s the one released on June 25th. A more detailed, classified version of the report was delivered to Congress on June 2nd, per a person familiar with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xVWbdV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the report include? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IMbhJT"&gt;It has always been very unlikely that the Pentagon report would tell us what the objects are, and it still doesn’t sound like US intelligence officials know much about them. It’s as much a mystery as it is a national security concern, it indicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8ytnX"&gt;The report was only able to confidently confirm the identity of a single UAP out of 144 reports. “In that case,” the report says, “we identified the object as a large, deflating balloon. The others remain unexplained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvPLc3"&gt;The task force focused on reports from military aviators made between 2004 and 2021, the majority coming out within the past two years, after a new reporting system was put in place. 18 incidents seemed to feature unusual flight patterns. 11 reports from aviators documented “near misses” with a UAP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ks0uIH"&gt;From the report: “Some UAP appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion. In a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with UAP sightings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nd3ZEX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any videos of the UFOs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zjhw"&gt;Yep, there are four videos — three were declassified and released via the Freedom of Information Act by the Navy in 2020 after being leaked in 2007 and 2017, and one was leaked and later authenticated by the Defense Department in 2019. The videos show four separate incidents. Reid, the former senator and UAP hawk, said disclosure of the three videos “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorReid/status/1254836730546384897?s=20"&gt;only scratches the surface&lt;/a&gt; of research and materials available” to the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2UnIVS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Pentagon UFO videos: FLIR, GIMBAL, and GOFAST|102729" data-volume-uuid="4089203ee" data-volume-id="102729" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-596" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k6E6AJ"&gt;The three declassified black-and-white videos, titled FLIR, GOFAST, and GIMBAL, are the most tantalizing. Captured by instrument cameras aboard Navy fighter aircraft in 2004, 2014, and 2015, they appear to show tiny, pill-shaped objects whizzing through the air. One of them appears to rotate midflight. Two videos show the objects speeding over ocean waters, coming with commentary from the pilots: “Look at that thing, dude!” one pilot yells. “It’s rotating,” says another. “There’s a whole fleet of them... They’re all going against the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NMCv05"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could the UFOs be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BIhWE9"&gt;We don’t know yet, and there’s probably not a single explanation for all of them. The report lists five possibilities for what the UAPs could be: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c1OHHH"&gt;Something extremely benign like UAVs, flocks of birds or other “airborne clutter,” like plastic bags, the UAP report said. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tZgSbc"&gt;Top-secret US technology that the Navy and other agencies don’t know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ifQ5qn"&gt;Foreign technology from US adversaries like Russia or China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qI5Uha"&gt;Some kind of natural phenomena — atmospheric conditions that get picked up on instruments or cause weird illusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KkOja2"&gt;Other — the catch-all term for ‘yeah, we have no idea.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EgET50"&gt;Intelligence officials ruled out the possibility that the UAPs were glimpses of secret US technology in action, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;report. The unclassified report published Friday said officials were “unable to confirm” that any reported UAPs originated from secret government programs. And it’s worth noting that the UAPs can be any number of those five theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0OmoQP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what about aliens? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OoxoTn"&gt;Aliens would fall pretty firmly into the ‘other’ category, and while the theory has captured the popular imagination, this is the most controversial idea out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22g8zA"&gt;Mick West, a pseudoscience debunker, told CNN that characteristics of the Naval aircraft videos make the objects appear more interesting than they should be. “It never really does anything interesting, and it might simply be a distant plane,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MickWest/status/1396136405349269511"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r119JWI04Ls&amp;amp;ab_channel=MickWest"&gt;In a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, West rebutted the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ use of the term “Glowing Auras” in the headline of its 2017 story to describe UAPs recorded on thermal video cameras, which sometimes makes objects look like they’re glowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3ya1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All options have to be on the table.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aBsgwe"&gt;Elizondo, the very vocal former AATIP director, would beg to differ with West’s assessment. He hasn’t claimed UAPs represent alien technology, but his colorful descriptions to the press continue to hype up that prospect: “We’re dealing with a technology that could be 50-1,000 years ahead of us,” he &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2021/06/08/ufos-national-security-with-luis-elizondo-former-director-advanced-aerospace-threat-identification-program-aatip/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;in a live interview&lt;/a&gt; last week. “At the end of the day, we don’t know what we’re dealing with. All options have to be on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mh98GO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the US struggling to understand these sightings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NAL3rh"&gt;The report starts with a caveat: a lack of quality information “hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or intent of UAP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEjhuJ"&gt;Stigmas around UFOs have had a chilling effect on legitimate discussions about unidentified phenomena in the US military, the report indicated, citing “sociocultural stigmas” and rifts between analysts and aviators. “Narratives from aviators in the operational community and analysts from the military and IC [intelligence community] describe disparagement associated with observing UAP, reporting it, or attempting to discuss it with colleagues,” the report said. Reporting unidentifiable phenomena is a “reputational risk”  that “may keep many observers silent, complicating scientific pursuit of the topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbafXK"&gt;The report also noted that cameras aboard military aircraft are specialized for tactical operations and aren’t suited for capturing the unidentifiable phenomena, hampering analysts’ ability to study sightings after-the-fact. Having multiple sensors and cameras have their perks, especially when working together during a run-in with something unknown — radio-frequency sensors are good at capturing the velocity of an object, while cameras can reveal an object’s size, the report said. But absent those capabilities, analysis of UAP is difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wEdCA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Blink-182 involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8VPUnK"&gt;Not exactly. But Blink-182’s former lead singer, Tom DeLonge, is. DeLonge is obsessed with UFOs. Don’t even get him started on UFOs, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUCtu_fq18&amp;amp;ab_channel=MrSnrub"&gt;he warns in this undated interview on UFOs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOy9Ab"&gt;DeLonge is so obsessed with unidentified phenomena that he left his punk-rock band bank in 2015 to start an organization in 2017 called To the Stars Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences (TTSA), a research and media company based in Las Vegas — yes, the same city as Bigelow’s space company. TTSA is relevant because it’s where Elizondo and Chris Mellon, former Democratic staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, wound up after leaving their government posts. The company pushed for and promoted the release of the three Navy videos and actually worked with Bigelow and various government agencies to investigate UAP. The organization signed an agreement with the US Army in 2019 to study “exotic metals” recovered under the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fl6Rrz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“TTSA has decided to restructure its operations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxiESw"&gt;But TTSA ran into problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Elizondo and Mellon left the company earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1710274/000149315221004131/form1-u.htm"&gt;according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing&lt;/a&gt; from February. “TTSA has decided to restructure its operations to scale back its initiatives in science and tech commercialization and to place a greater emphasis on the operations of its entertainment business,” the filing said. It’s unclear what came of the Army agreement after TTSA’s shift away from UAP research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4zhXHT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But come on... it’s aliens, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mP2VPR"&gt;Probably not. The slow drip of news from the Pentagon on UAPs has allowed a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/pentagon-s-ufo-footage-obama-s-curiosity-ratchet-expectations-big-ncna1268222"&gt;alien hype&lt;/a&gt; to fester. Does that mean aliens don’t exist anywhere in the universe? No. There are multiple ongoing projects to look for alien life, or signs of past alien life, well beyond UFOs. To name a few: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt; on Mars, a &lt;a href="https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/news/cfa-scientists-collaborate-new-study-search-universe-signs-technological-civilizations"&gt;joint academic hunt for technosignatures&lt;/a&gt; coming from distant corners of the universe, or any of the hundreds of research programs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22545453/alien-planets-view-earth-astronomers-journal-nature"&gt;examining exoplanets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQEeLN"&gt;While an outcome involving aliens might be fun, it’s still hasn’t happened in today’s UAP saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EIajH7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 6:11 PM 6/25: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with details from the unclassified UAP report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now Microsoft’s app will say why your PC isn’t ready for Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7PX04HkowAC9WocXSu5vkDLRHk=/0x38:795x568/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69506097/E4vsDYuVcAIg1CC.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OCMJmC"&gt;Microsoft has updated its PC Health Check App to show more information about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;why your computer won’t be able to run Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, to help deal with some of the confusion that’s sprung up around compatibility. If you’ve already downloaded the app, it should auto-update when you go to run it again, and if you haven’t downloaded it yet &lt;a href="https://t.co/hTWMe16DWO?amp=1"&gt;you can get it here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0CY8Nc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just made updates to the Windows 11 PC Health Check App. It now provides more detailed info on requirements not met. This should help in cases where folks assumed CPU compat issues were TPM related  &lt;a href="https://t.co/hTWMe16DWO"&gt;https://t.co/hTWMe16DWO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eZLTZMOdjT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eZLTZMOdjT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DWIZZZLE (@dwizzzleMSFT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1408479215813480449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qb3TVf"&gt;There’s been a bit of confusion about what Windows 11 will and won’t run on, and the previous version of the tool didn’t necessarily help clear any of it up, mainly showing users a pass/fail message with no details. Now, it should at least give some clue as to why your computer isn’t compatible, be it an issue with storage, secure boot compatibility, or your processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlkRfM"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greengart/status/1408520323406995457?s=20"&gt;some have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, the messages the tool gives out are still light on details in some cases: “the processor isn’t supported” isn’t really an actionable item, as it doesn’t tell you &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; your CPU can’t run Windows 11. If you’d rather upgrade a component or two in your system instead of just going out and buying a new PC, you’re going to have to do some more research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57Mtd9"&gt;You may want to wait on that, though: Microsoft still seems to be working through its messaging of what is and isn’t supported, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;especially when it comes to CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. So stay tuned for a final answer before you try to brave the PC part market &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;during a chip shortage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Read the Pentagon’s UFO Report to Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhUahzTlbsw7bLd05UKqtUpxYNw=/0x114:1462x1089/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69505836/Screen_Shot_2021_06_25_at_3.01.18_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Department of Defense / US Navy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESwSQ1"&gt;An unclassified version of the Pentagon’s report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs, aka UFOs) was sent to Congress on Friday, showing that more than 140 instances of strange sightings by military aircraft remain a mystery. This is the public’s first glance at the 9-page report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEbgq0"&gt;Last year, Congress gave the Defense Department a six-month deadline to share classified and unclassified versions of a report on UAPs cataloged by the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force. The task force’s existence was announced in August 2020 and its mission is “to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” Today marks the deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luocYA"&gt;Senate committees received the classified version of the report on June 2nd. And leaks earlier this month to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, citing unnamed US intelligence officials, indicated the task force’s assessment has remained largely inconclusive, unable to identify the mysterious aircraft. The 180-day anticipation over the report, as well as scant public comments from the Pentagon, have spawned a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22550116/uap-ufo-pentagon-report-aliens"&gt;swell of attention&lt;/a&gt; on the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoLwjB"&gt;In 2020, footage of four different sightings released by the Navy showed pill-shaped objects twisting and turning midair. The videos also revived conspiracy theories that the government has proof of alien UFOs, though the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;story on the report cites intelligence officials as saying no evidence backing up that theory had been found — but that it couldn’t be ruled out, either. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; also says intelligence officials swiftly ruled out any possibility of the objects being secret US aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkjPVS"&gt;You can read the full report &lt;a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2021/item/2223-preliminary-assessment-unidentified-aerial-phenomena"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or below. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 will be able to sideload Android apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtMLkZBo7x32ue8iMQZbn6VGzWo=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69505476/MicrosoftTeams_image_1_1024x683.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gy4VSF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1408222245265330178?s=20"&gt;According to an engineer at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, Windows 11 users will have the ability to sideload Android apps onto the operating system, which looks like an answer to one of the biggest questions we had when Microsoft announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;bringing Android apps to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; via the Amazon Appstore (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/25/microsoft-engineer-windows-11-will-let-you-sideload-android-apps/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This means that once Windows 11 launches, you won’t just have to stick to the apps that Amazon makes available, but it does raise some new questions about how running Android apps on Windows will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cgITs"&gt;For example, it’s unclear what the process for running or installing a sideloaded app will be. Chrome OS technically has the ability to run sideloaded apps, too, but &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/arc/development-environment"&gt;the process isn’t exactly easy&lt;/a&gt;, as it involves enabling Linux and doing some command line work. We asked Microsoft for details about what running Android apps from outside the Amazon Appstore would be like, and it provided us with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JTDxY9"&gt;Customers will be able to discover Android apps on the Microsoft Store and acquire them through the Amazon Appstore. We’ll have more to share at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DEnJrO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sideloading apps solves the app availability problem, but it raises concerns of its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8fMFu"&gt;It’s possible that the desire for sideloading apps onto Windows wouldn’t be as strong had Microsoft included Google’s Play Store instead of Amazon’s Appstore. While having any app store will obviously grant Windows users access to many programs that they couldn’t previously run on their computers, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1408088973830991876?s=20"&gt;has some notable omissions from its catalog&lt;/a&gt;. If a Windows user wanted to run the Android version of Snapchat or Apple Music, they wouldn’t be able to get them from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQPF9i"&gt;While sideloading apps helps solve this problem, it does raise concerns of its own. The first is the question of where users will obtain those apps: while there aren’t likely to be piracy concerns with free apps like Snapchat, the ability to load an APK could allow people to get paid apps for free from less-than-legal repositories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZO30K"&gt;There’s also the question of safety and whether Windows will have the ability to scan sideloaded apps for potentially malicious behavior, a feature that Google builds into Android already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kumI5P"&gt;While it’s clear that there’s still a lot that Microsoft hasn’t covered about what running Android apps on Windows 11’s will actually be like (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549303/windows-11-intel-bridge-android-apps-amd-arm-processors"&gt;the technical details it’s revealed&lt;/a&gt; are fascinating), it’s still good to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1408203218492997634?s=20"&gt;have confirmation from someone at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; that the selection of Android apps won’t just be limited to what’s on Amazon’s Appstore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pZs6c"&gt;Hopefully Microsoft will start sharing more details on exactly how Android apps will work soon so it can get feedback from both Windows users and Android developers before the feature becomes available for everyone, likely later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIz2i2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated June 25th 9:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report on an app that turns intelligence gathering into gig work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XCfVl78QqIW1zBPUfKsZraC-g4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69505461/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9Okiw"&gt;Smartphones helped popularize the modern gig economy, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/app-taps-unwitting-users-abroad-to-gather-open-source-intelligence-11624544026"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests some companies like Premise have found a new way to take advantage of workers trying to make extra money — turning them into unwitting spies for corporate and military clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZegscY"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Byron Tau writes, Premise was originally started “to register prices in the developing world and help its customers better understand the needs of the population.” But the company reportedly found even more success having contributors perform TaskRabbit and Mechanical Turk-esque work like completing surveys, taking photos of locations, and walking specific paths, while occasionally scooping up information about nearby Wi-Fi networks and cell towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkEFnI"&gt;That might not immediately send up the biggest red flags, but Premise was also apparently paying contributors in Afghanistan to identify and photograph Shiite mosques in the city of Kabul, which is hard to not see as a little suspicious. Premise told Tau that photographing religious sites is a standard task used “to help clients understand the physical and social geography of a place,” but the Premise contributor Tau spoke to was concerned they had been asked to complete tasks that involved spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UZmjs"&gt;Needless to say, there’s a lot about Premise’s clients and proposed business partners (hint: some of them own fighter jets) that seem at least somewhat concerning, even if on paper Premise can claim it’s not running a distributed CIA. If you want the story in all its surprising horror, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/app-taps-unwitting-users-abroad-to-gather-open-source-intelligence-11624544026"&gt;you should read the full report&lt;/a&gt; for all the information Tau dug up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is deleting Internet Explorer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="internet explorer 9 logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5TXi9_Gp0jec7lU7J6qzkvao7U=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69505443/ie9logo.1419971092.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;internet explorer 9 logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6p5WeO"&gt;At one point in Windows 10’s lifetime, you could have had Internet Explorer, the legacy version of Microsoft Edge, and the new Chromium-powered Edge all installed. This trio of browsers was the perfect illustration of Microsoft’s struggles with the web over the past decade, but now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443997/microsoft-internet-explorer-end-of-support-date"&gt;Internet Explorer is being laid to rest in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, it’s disappearing from Windows 11, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC4bGe"&gt;Microsoft revealed yesterday that Internet Explorer will be “disabled” in Windows 11. At first, I was worried that it meant Internet Explorer might hang around ahead of the final nail in its coffin on June 15th, 2022, but it’s actually fully disappearing from Windows 11. “The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will not be available on Windows 11. Microsoft Edge is the default browser for Windows 11,” explains a Microsoft spokesperson to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The MSHTML engine exists as part of the Windows 11 operating system to power IE mode in Microsoft Edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pssRSwFPrLsVC5jjjb3NOcqzs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681927/windows11ie.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer doesn’t launch in the leaked copy of Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZssqJa"&gt;We weren’t expecting Internet Explorer to appear in Windows 11, but Microsoft did warn that the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) of Windows 10 would still include Internet Explorer next year despite a consumer removal planned for June 15th, 2022. Windows 11 will now fully remove the browser, and if you use shortcuts like iexplore, then you’ll now be redirected to Microsoft Edge instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgFf0X"&gt;It’s the first time Microsoft hasn’t bundled Internet Explorer with a new version of Windows for more than 20 years. If memory serves me correct, the Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.5 in 1997 was the first time Microsoft explicitly bundled Internet Explorer into Windows Explorer and other key parts of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zpm149"&gt;That bundling led to the infamous &lt;em&gt;United States v. Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; antitrust battle just a year after Internet Explorer’s debut in October 1997. The rest, as they say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards"&gt;is history&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NtSjoT"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows operating system has been a major presence in the computer industry for decades. Currently, PCs loaded with Windows 10 are being manufactured and sold by a variety of companies in an even wider variety of models. Come the 2021 holiday season, we can expect that PCs will be shipping with Microsoft’s new Windows 11 — and if your current system is compatible, you will be able to upgrade to the new free OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7hC5d1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KgK2IK"&gt;This abundance of choice has its advantages and disadvantages. While on the one hand, it means you can get a system that is exactly tailored to your needs, it also means you need to do some research before deciding on which Windows device is right for you. And while the operating system’s flexibility is an advantage, especially if you are tech-savvy or business-oriented, it also means finding features — and fixing problems — can be a complicated process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IQYud"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Guide to Windows is where you can find expert info and advice on topics such as how to change your sign-in settings, how to use the Windows Edge browser to protect your privacy, and how to take full advantage of the upgrade to Windows 11.

    <title>Why Windows 11 is forcing everyone to use TPM chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tErjIeOi0dqDJILpD1cCV_7KKsQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504823/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yqWTro"&gt;Microsoft announced yesterday that Windows 11 will require TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chips on existing and new devices. It’s a significant hardware change that has been years in the making, but Microsoft’s messy way of communicating this has left many confused about whether their hardware is compatible. What is a TPM, and why do you need one for Windows 11 anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2pQfb"&gt;“The Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) is a chip that is either integrated into your PC’s motherboard or added separately into the CPU,” &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F06%2F25%2Fwindows-11-enables-security-by-design-from-the-chip-to-the-cloud%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explains David Weston&lt;/a&gt;, director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft. “Its purpose is to protect encryption keys, user credentials, and other sensitive data behind a hardware barrier so that malware and attackers can’t access or tamper with that data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vTirEX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 is free, but your CPU might not be officially supported ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OQphEK"&gt;So it’s all about security. TPMs work by offering hardware-level protection instead of software only. It can be used to encrypt disks using Windows features like BitLocker, or to prevent dictionary attacks against passwords. TPM 1.2 chips have existed since 2011, but they’ve typically only been used widely in IT-managed business laptops and desktops. Microsoft wants to bring that same level of protection to everyone using Windows, even if it’s &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bitlocker-sleep-mode-vulnerability-can-bypass-windows-full-disk-encryption"&gt;not always perfect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBna7U_j3oWLNtBmFiubpY3vdXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681635/tpmchip.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dedicated TPM chip you probably don’t actually need for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hX28nA"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2F30%2Fnew-security-signals-study-shows-firmware-attacks-on-the-rise-heres-how-microsoft-is-working-to-help-eliminate-this-entire-class-of-threats%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warning for months&lt;/a&gt; that firmware attacks are on the rise. “Our own Security Signals report found that 83 percent of businesses experienced a firmware attack, and only 29 percent are allocating resources to protect this critical layer,” says Weston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NczTiG"&gt;That 83 percent figure seems huge, but when you consider the various phishing, ransomware, supply chain, and IoT vulnerabilities that exist, the broad range of attacks becomes a lot clearer. Ransomware attacks hit the headlines weekly, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware funds more ransomware so it’s a difficult problem to solve&lt;/a&gt;. TPMs will certainly help with certain attacks, but Microsoft is banking on a combination of modern CPUs, Secure Boot, and its set of virtualization protections to really make a dent in ransomware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjUKsl"&gt;Microsoft is trying to play its part, particularly as Windows is the platform that’s often most affected by these attacks. It’s widely used by businesses worldwide, and there are more than 1.3 billion Windows 10 machines in use today. Microsoft software has been at the core of devastating attacks that made global headlines, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;like the Russia-linked SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;Hafnium hacks on Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/a&gt;. And while the company isn’t responsible for forcing its clients to keep its software patched, it’s trying to be more proactive about protection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQFFXgpRx2nyANrz1qgnEmfgM_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681637/Windows_11_PC_Devices.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is pushing modern Windows 11 PCs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnRMhA"&gt;Microsoft has a habit of struggling to move Windows into the future in both hardware and software, and this particular change hasn’t been explained well. While Microsoft has required OEMs to ship devices with support for TPM chips since Windows 10, the company hasn’t forced users or its many device partners to turn these on for Windows to work. That’s what’s really changing with Windows 11, and combined with Microsoft’s Windows 11 upgrade checker, it has resulted in a lot of understandable confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vphth"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11%23pchealthcheck" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows 11 website lists&lt;/a&gt; the minimum system requirements, with a link to &lt;a href="http://aka.ms/CPUlist"&gt;compatible CPUs&lt;/a&gt; and a clear mention that a TPM 2.0 is required at a minimum. The PC Health Check app that Microsoft asks people to download and check to see if Windows 11 runs will flag systems that do not have Secure Boot or TPM support enabled or devices that have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;CPUs that aren’t officially supported&lt;/a&gt; (anything older than 8th Gen Intel chips).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmzreL"&gt;That’s left many trying to figure out if their device supports TPM or not, confusion with BIOS settings, and even people rushing to buy separate TPM modules they don’t need. Some are even scalping TPM 2.0 modules on eBay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5JQ4Ex"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks to Windows 11, people are scalping TPM2.0 modules as well now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$24.90 ➡ $99.90 in just 12 hours &lt;a href="https://t.co/9TTHC2c47w"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9TTHC2c47w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shen Ye (@shen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shen/status/1408284995131645956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zViYBC"&gt;It also didn’t help that Microsoft originally had a second webpage &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Hn9rVlipwicJ:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/windows-11/+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;with contradictory information&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/windows-11/"&gt;which it changed&lt;/a&gt; a couple hours after we published this story. According to the original version of the page, the true minimum requirements were TPM 1.2 and a 64-bit dual-core CPU that’s 1GHz or greater, but the new page now clarifies it requires TPM 2.0 and an processor that Microsoft has explicitly certified as compatible — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;which might mean everything before an 8th Gen Intel Core and AMD Ryzen 2000 won’t work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtQfSs"&gt;We’re still waiting for explicit confirmation from Microsoft on the CPU requirement, but a rep confirms that TPM 2.0 will be mandatory, and that the original information on that page was wrong. “The referenced docs page was a mistake that has since been corrected,” an MS rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7Tjn1wUFHOpsYbpxu8UdExCPug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22682095/new_old_system_requirements.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New vs. old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RNOS4n"&gt;Microsoft is promoting TPM 2.0 and performing checks for 8th Gen or newer Intel chips because these are the requirements for certified OEM hardware — the machines you’ll find in stores with an inevitable Windows 11 sticker. But it’s no longer clear whether the Windows 11 update will work on older machines either, and Microsoft is suggesting to us that it won’t. We understand Microsoft is currently putting together a blog post that will explain the minimum requirements in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="At7bpK"&gt;But that doesn’t mean your existing PC is out of luck just because you’re having issues with Microsoft’s compatibility tool. Unless your CPU is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; old, it probably already has baked-in TPM 2.0 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nXZuEk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;it’s not super obvious and every BIOS varies. On mine it’s literally just “PTT.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrmSGEgARN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CrmSGEgARN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1408209347914653706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvUZYX"&gt;If you’re having issues with the PC Health App checker for Windows 11, make sure you have “PTT” on Intel systems enabled in the BIOS, or “PSP fTPM” on AMD devices. The company’s system checker should also be less confusing now: shortly after we published this story, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1408479215813480449"&gt;Weston tweeted that the tool will now be more specific&lt;/a&gt; about why your PC isn’t passing muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gx5Qm4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just made updates to the Windows 11 PC Health Check App. It now provides more detailed info on requirements not met. This should help in cases where folks assumed CPU compat issues were TPM related  &lt;a href="https://t.co/hTWMe16DWO"&gt;https://t.co/hTWMe16DWO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eZLTZMOdjT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eZLTZMOdjT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DWIZZZLE (@dwizzzleMSFT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1408479215813480449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jUPlfI"&gt;What Microsoft is trying to achieve here will benefit the Windows ecosystem in years to come, alongside its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571069/microsoft-pluton-processor-security-windows-pc"&gt;efforts for Xbox-like security on Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft just totally dropped the ball on explaining that to everyone on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mG7EN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:26PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Microsoft updated its PC Health Check app, shortly after we published this story, to be more specific about why your computer isn’t meeting Windows 11 system requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYJRiF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 3:53PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that Microsoft has changed its compatibility page to mention TPM 2.0 as a requirement instead of TPM 1.2, and that specific CPUs may be a requirement. We’re getting to the bottom of this now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uetZUH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 8:06PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally stated Windows 11 would likely still install on PCs with access to TPM 1.2 and older CPUs, because that’s what we read in Microsoft’s documentation. Microsoft has now corrected those documents to specify TPM 2.0 is a minimum requirement for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
