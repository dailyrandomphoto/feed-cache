    <title>How to fix Deathloop ‘stuttering’ issues on PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSKgq9V7V_faIif-gORFVpgmnAE=/429x0:2589x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69885518/deathloop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EojSD0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the big triple-A game of the moment, and it’s an amazing experience — assuming you’re not fighting your gaming PC to get it to run smoothly. Bethesda is aware, and a patch seems to be on the way. But as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Alex Battaglia explains in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu_XHyO-6zY"&gt;this in-depth video&lt;/a&gt;, there may be a few things you can try right now to fix it, including one weird, counterintuitive trick that instantly made my seemingly stuttery performance smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfDENn"&gt;Also, there’s a new patch as of September 21st &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1252330/view/5568127835954403760?linkId=132678876"&gt;that Bethesda says&lt;/a&gt; might &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; fix the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flFyMD"&gt;Here’s the TL;DR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x4UgO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Obvious:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduce your quality settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lk2mRz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Also obvious: &lt;/strong&gt;Try the initial hotfix, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1252330/view/5568127835954403760?linkId=132678876"&gt;now available in Steam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aCrtfP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Counterintuitive: &lt;/strong&gt;Lock your framerate at 60 or 120fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ydt9Pq"&gt;Let’s start with that last one, because it’s what worked for me — and it may be the only thing that works if you’ve got a fancy G-Sync / FreeSync monitor with variable refresh rate. Simply go to the game’s &lt;strong&gt;Video Settings &lt;/strong&gt;page, turn off &lt;strong&gt;V-Sync&lt;/strong&gt; entirely, and set your &lt;strong&gt;FPS Limiter&lt;/strong&gt; to 60 or — if your performance is high enough — 120 fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TTplP6vb5HA_GerONCujKTZhSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865395/deathloop_fps_limiter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down the video settings menu and you’ll find V-Sync and FPS Limiter. You’ll have to turn off V-Sync first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MJjnuC"&gt;You might be asking: “Isn’t the whole point of V-Sync and my fancy VRR monitor to keep this sort of stutter from happening?” Yes, but as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry &lt;/em&gt;explains, what you’re seeing has more to do with mouse movement than syncing your GPU’s frames to your monitor’s refresh rate. This isn’t the tearing you see when frames hit in the middle of a refresh, or the microstutter you might have experienced when frames are delayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tm0oL8"&gt;In fact, Battaglia shows that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; can deliver excellent frame times — there’s just a mismatch when you’re turning your digital character’s head at non-standard refresh rates, like the ones your variable refresh monitor is &lt;em&gt;designed &lt;/em&gt;to provide. With an RTX 3080, my GPU could easily send 80 fps to my G-Sync monitor in many scenes at near-4K resolution, but locking it to 60 counterintuitively made everything feel far smoother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTiD7I"&gt;Another thing you might want to do (though you may also want to &lt;em&gt;undo&lt;/em&gt; it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after the next public patch: try the hotfix &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1438540739856715788"&gt;that Bethesda’s currently asking users to help test&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pu8YA3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1252330/view/5568127835954403760?linkId=132678876"&gt;As of September 21st&lt;/a&gt;, this may now be as easy as updating your game. Originally, you had to right click on &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; in your Steam library, select &lt;strong&gt;Properties &lt;/strong&gt;and then &lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt;, type &lt;strong&gt;juliannashotme&lt;/strong&gt; into the access code field, hit &lt;strong&gt;Check Code&lt;/strong&gt;, then and &lt;strong&gt;Opt into&lt;/strong&gt; the public_beta branch that appears. Let us know if you see a difference between the beta and new patch?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOoYdaCHIyqHA1h6wwX-flwdCvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865439/Vqbx0fxvgO.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to hit Check Code and also Opt into before the beta hotfix will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gYDNFo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports the hotfix seems to smooth over one of the mouse issues, though Battaglia still points out other problems in his full video, including one where you may need to quit out of a mission or start the next level before it resolves itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvb9Y2"&gt;Lastly, it’s possible you’re just picking graphical settings that are unnecessarily high for what’s quite a demanding game. &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; looks great at High levels of detail, often with little noticeable difference compared to Very High or Ultra, as you can see in the video atop this post. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vh3sSu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;DEATHLOOP PC players, we have released an update that addresses Steam achievements and adds descriptive error reporting for crashes on launch. We are also investigating reports of "stuttering" on PC, and are exploring fixes.

    <title>The Oversight Board wants answers about Facebook’s celebrity moderation program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pbXdYtwFK0OkrXAH8FMn2A4hAhU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890688/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTUrov"&gt;The Oversight Board, a semi-independent body that reviews Facebook’s moderation policies, &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/3056753157930994-to-treat-users-fairly-facebook-must-commit-to-transparency/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it wants more information about the “cross-check” system Facebook uses to “review content decisions relating to some high-profile users.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671565/facebook-xcheck-moderation-system-high-profile-exemptions"&gt;Cross-check is getting called into question&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that claimed the system lets high-profile users break the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WI9XTK"&gt;“In light of recent developments, we are looking into the degree to which Facebook has been fully forthcoming in its responses in relation to cross-check, including the practice of whitelisting,” the board writes. “We expect to receive a briefing from Facebook in the coming days and will be reporting what we hear from this as part of our first release of quarterly transparency reports, which we will publish in October.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p2ChUI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cross-check has the Oversight Board’s attention&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i1v4RH"&gt;Cross-check (sometimes referred to as XCheck) is supposed to add an extra level of scrutiny to high-profile moderation calls that could cause controversy for Facebook. But the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;claims it covered a huge swathe of 5.8 million people in 2020, and only 10 percent of the posts sent to the program got reviewed by Facebook’s second layer of specialized moderators. According to the report, users included in the program include Senator Elizabeth Warren, conservative commentator Candace Owens, and former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwU8aC"&gt;Trump’s relative protection via cross-check came up &lt;a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-691QAMHJ"&gt;in the board’s decision&lt;/a&gt; to uphold&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt; the former President’s Facebook ban&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the board noted that there’s limited public information about cross-check reviews — &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/07/working-to-keep-facebook-safe/"&gt;a 2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most recent. It advised the company to “clearly explain the rationale, standards, and processes of review, including the criteria to determine which pages and accounts are selected for inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVUxAY"&gt;As with all Oversight Board actions, Facebook allows itself some flexibility in how to respond. The company has publicly committed to following the organization’s calls on individual moderation decisions but reserves the right to not follow broader recommendations. It’s also not legally bound to follow the board’s rules. With today’s announcement and renewed pressure to clarify a program with issues Facebook’s already working to address, maybe we’ll finally learn more about the controversial program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s new pan &amp; tilt cam can see everywhere</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m5BQo4PgCcoDl4klrpJa-GTDDPA=/25x0:4147x2748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890665/Wyze_Cam_Pan_v2_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThuMeH"&gt;Ubiquitous budget smart home company Wyze has released yet another new product — the &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-cam-pan.html"&gt;Wyze Cam Pan v2&lt;/a&gt;. As the name implies, this is the second generation of one of Wyze’s earliest products — the Wyze Cam Pan that debuted three years ago. This new model is available now, costs $39.99 (plus $9.99 shipping), and adds color night vision, improved motion-tracking, and a siren to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5t00d3"&gt;There’s no change in form factor, and the Wyze Cam Pan v2 camera looks virtually identical to its (now-discontinued) predecessor. It’s a wired, indoor camera with 1080p HD video and two-way talk. But its main party trick is the ability to rotate on its base and capture a 360-degree view of your home from side-to-side and a 93-degree view vertically, so you can spot Spiderman when he crawls in through the skylight. A Pan Scan feature lets you set four custom waypoints that the camera continuously scans, so you’re sort of getting four cameras in one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bx8pufrzFwvOi7gE7KJI6xYI28s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868137/Wyze_Cam_Pan_v2_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze has refreshed one of its earliest products, the Wyze Cam Pan, adding color night vision and a siren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kACLqG"&gt;But the big feature is the introduction of color night vision — powered by a Starlight Sensor that first debuted in the Wyze Cam v3 indoor/outdoor camera. This adds the option to see the 1080p full HD video footage the camera captures at night in full color, instead of the grainy black and white of traditional night vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fuyKR"&gt;Rather than relying on a built-in spotlight for color night vision, the sensor utilizes any available light to illuminate the scene more colorfully. Wyze says it can see in rooms as dark as 0.1 LUX (that’s very dark). If there’s not enough light, it can be set to automatically switch to standard black and white night vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLCpTt"&gt;Another improvement over the original model is a faster processor, which Wyze says enables its motion tracking feature to more quickly follow real-time movement. You can toggle this on or off in the Settings in the app, but when on, it will identify a moving object — such as a person or pet — and automatically track it. This is something that makes the original Wyze Cam Pan an excellent pet monitor, and the new model’s faster processor is likely even better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dp5qqit4jRA_lsZ0qbs7DQznQkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868151/Wyze_Cam_Pan_v2_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wyze Cam Pan v2 uses a Starlight Sensor to enhance night vision in lowlight conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QfR8x0"&gt;The two-way talk feature can also help you keep in touch with Fido or Felix while you’re at work or yell at an intruder. And now there’s a siren option, which you can activate in the Wyze app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KODm8u"&gt;The final new feature is invisible infrared lights. Anyone who’s ever tried to use a security camera as a baby monitor will know why this is key: the camera face will remain black in a dark room and not disturb any sleeping babies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfcF6P"&gt;Included features that are also on Wyze’s other cams are local storage via a micro SD card (not included) that enables 24/7 recording, free 14-day rolling cloud storage of event-based videos, up to 12 seconds per clip, and the ability to listen for smoke and CO alarms. You can add longer clips and smart alerts for people, pets, vehicles, and packages with a Cam Plus subscription (starting at $1.25 a month, and you get one month free). All in, there are a lot of great specs and features here, in a tiny little camera, all for a pretty low price (although not as low as it used to be — the v1 started out at $30). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPR1lx"&gt;This is what Wyze is known for, rock bottom prices for close-to-top-of-the-line specs. But in reality, these features don’t always pan out. And sometimes, those that have been promised fail to materialize (Alexa and Google Assistant integration are on the way, says Wyze). We’ll check back with an update once we’ve tested the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHsIQX"&gt;But if this is the camera you’ve been waiting for, you might not want to wait any longer. The Wyze Pan Cam v2 is shipping now, and Wyze has had a fair amount of trouble keeping stuff in stock recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPu0RD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shang-Chi will start streaming on November 12th as part of Disney Plus Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tony Leung as Wenwu and Fala Chen as Jiang Li in a combative embrace." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y3Io45gTEm3lplpI3PmXvKWaR4M=/520x0:3094x1716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890597/WML3070_cmp_scn_v0011.1002_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AgsH3Y"&gt;Disney is making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634609/marvel-shang-chi-ten-rings-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;available to stream at no additional cost for subscribers &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/walt-disney-company-celebrates-disney-plus-day-november-12"&gt;as part of its newly announced Disney Plus Day&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating the second anniversary of Disney Plus on November 12th. Along with its latest Marvel blockbuster, the company is introducing new movies, shows, and Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; specials as part of “a grand-scale celebration of our subscribers across the entire company,” says Disney CEO Bob Chapek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfFmn6"&gt;Disney tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that both &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595789/jungle-cruise-review-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will be available to stream at no additional cost for subscribers on November 12th. (&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; is currently available on Premiere Access; &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is only in theaters.) There will also be a special “celebrating the origins and legacy” of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars’ &lt;/em&gt;Boba Fett, a special “celebrating the Marvel Cinematic Universe on Disney+ with an exciting look towards the future,” and a new &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; movie called &lt;em&gt;Home Sweet Home Alone.&lt;/em&gt; Other releases include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jx0xeJ"&gt;A new series of shorts called &lt;em&gt;Olaf Presents&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YYVJSt"&gt;The streaming debut of beloved and award-winning shorts like &lt;em&gt;Frozen Fever,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Paperman,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Get A Horse!,&lt;/em&gt; and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4SatK"&gt;A Pixar animated short called &lt;em&gt;Ciao Alberto&lt;/em&gt; starring characters from &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eqxHG3"&gt;A new short starring characters from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; that “pays tribute to Disney+’s marquee brands” (please just leave these characters alone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rTUNyB"&gt;And the first five episodes of the second season of &lt;em&gt;The World According to Jeff Goldblum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d5bjv5"&gt;Disney’s pandemic release strategy has been a mixed bag. Doing a day and date “Premiere Access” debut for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; resulted in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;ongoing lawsuit between Scarlett Johansson and the company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise &lt;/em&gt;faired better, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22604674/jungle-cruise-disney-plus-premier-access-opening-revenues"&gt;reportedly earning a third of its opening revenue&lt;/a&gt; from Disney Plus. Chapek had stressed &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/shang-chi-disney-theatrical-day-and-date-bob-chapek-earnings-1234813885/"&gt;the flexibility of &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; premiering in theaters&lt;/a&gt; with its shorter 45-day theater exclusivity. That experiment seems to be paying off: &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/09/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-marvel-box-office-labor-day-1234662250/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi &lt;/em&gt;earned $90 million&lt;/a&gt; during Labor Day weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUNwoK"&gt;Disney Plus Day seems to mirror a similar strategy from Netflix, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;holding a fan event on the 25th&lt;/a&gt; to introduce new movies, trailers, and interviews with stars. These marketing events are an easy way to get fans to swallow a lot of ads, but they also drive eyes to services — something Disney likely wants &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-plus-slowdown-q4-subscribers-bob-chapek-1235070370/"&gt;if subscriber growth slows as Chapek predicts&lt;/a&gt;. Outside streaming, Disney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22668326/disney-movies-exclusive-theatrical-streaming-black-widow-eternals-johansson"&gt;has more theatrical releases&lt;/a&gt; on the way as well, including &lt;em&gt;Eternals &lt;/em&gt;in November and &lt;em&gt;West&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Side Story &lt;/em&gt;in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Pixel 6 Pro may have been leaked in a brief hands-on video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAHQ3fry4N3AD_R8tjhn_Eu_z2g=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890456/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WVVTzX"&gt;Google got ahead of any possible news leaks about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;announcing the phones&lt;/a&gt; back in August, including that they would run on the company’s long-in-development Tensor chip. But it’s possible that some leakers have recently got hold of an actual unit. A video posted to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032"&gt;Twitter by @thisistechtoday&lt;/a&gt; may be showing off a pre-production version of the Pixel 6 Pro, complete with its triple rear camera array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCKvP"&gt;Of course, Google hasn’t been coy about sharing what the device will look like — even installing &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-look-google-puts-pixel-6-and-6-pro-on-display-at-its-nyc-store"&gt;dummy units in its NYC store for people to ogle&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the device that’s spun around in this short clip looks like what we’ve seen so far — the strange Google logo placeholder notwithstanding. The phone in this video appears to have a hole-punch selfie camera, and all of its buttons are located along its right edge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G1CaYO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I think this may be the first hands on video leak of a Google Pixel 6 Pro. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FYI: The logo would indicate that this is likely an early production test unit, so that means there may be some differences between what you see here and the actual production device. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4QSvdktqA7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4QSvdktqA7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1440385355258028032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hP7jt"&gt;Just like the Pixel 6 Pro renders that Google shared, the phone in this video appears to have a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0w_6uZBFl8F94sDwJAiydSFMAr4=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755095/Pixel_6_Pro_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;metallic and glossy rail&lt;/a&gt; surrounding its raised camera bar, as opposed to the Pixel 6’s &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGTDiRqYZ_v7B0qBMCPFTj6yxMo=/0x0:3840x2160/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3840x2160):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755096/Pixel_6_Group_Image__Transparent_.png"&gt;darker, matte-textured &lt;/a&gt;rail. Admittedly, it’s tough to tell for sure in this footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWDObJ"&gt;So while it isn’t as if we haven’t seen what the phone looks like, what’s notable in this video is that the display is powered on, which is an angle on the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro that we &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; seen much of, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;outside of this new ad&lt;/a&gt;. Admittedly, though, it’s a rather boring glimpse, showing the same screen you see during the Android 12 setup process. The Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kA26HW"&gt;We still don’t know exactly when Google plans to fully take the wraps off the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro or when it will share prices and a release date. But it ought to be soon, perhaps sometime in October, if previous years are any indication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At pivotal points in human spaceflight, NASA undergoes major reorganization </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX And NASA Prepare For Next Launch Attempt On Saturday, After Weather Delays Wednesday Launch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Xa0SIIWHq5JZHiSZDVl6oD4-Ho=/33x0:3000x1978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890291/1227593491.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOCGlv"&gt;The body of NASA tasked with managing human spaceflight is being split into two distinct directorates, the agency’s chief announced on Tuesday, embarking on a major reorganization that past officials have tried and failed to execute for years. The move comes as private companies like SpaceX demonstrate leaner methods of putting people in space and as NASA pushes ahead with ambitious plans to build settlements on the surface of the Moon in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi8IRI"&gt;The breakup of NASA’s human exploration wing, called Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, will spawn two new bodies: first, the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, which will manage NASA’s most ambitious development programs like the Artemis program that are still in formative and testing phases. The second will be the Space Operations Mission Directorate, which will handle more routine, operational programs like the International Space Station and the Commercial Crew Program. Agency officials say categorizing programs based on levels of development rather than areas of expertise will help refine NASA’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGp4mX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Two heads are better than one.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0BbX7G"&gt;The organizational shakeup was a “strong” recommendation from President Biden’s transition team, Nelson told reporters during a press conference on the changes. One major advantage of the change involves NASA’s budgeting process, which is often fraught with complexity and frequently faces pushback from members of Congress who complain NASA doesn’t provide enough clarity on its exploration plans. With the broad human exploration program now split in two, complex and sometimes ambiguous programs won’t be as intermixed with NASA’s more routine programs. And the two bodies will have separate leaders rather than a single official whose workload has seen steep growth in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1rWW99bvkNKPxDL5jdB6mNTs_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867738/51399128214_36009d4571_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;(NASA/Bill Ingalls)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s human exploration chief, Kathy Lueders, will now lead a new directorate focused on space operations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fQfBmw"&gt;“Two heads are better than one,” Kathy Lueders, the current head of NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, said during a town hall in Washington, DC, with the agency’s workforce on Tuesday. Lueders, who previously led NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, will move from her post as human spaceflight chief to helm the Space Operations Mission Directorate. Jim Free, a former deputy associate administrator who held senior roles in NASA’s Orion capsule program, will lead the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcbdqU"&gt;But not everyone in the space industry will be happy with the change. Lueders, seen by many as a champion for commercial space because of her experience leading the Commercial Crew Program during its formative years, won’t be as involved in the agency’s biggest development programs like Artemis anymore. Critics of the reorganization are also likely to see it as more red tape and a new burden of coordination between the two offices that will have to stay in touch on related space programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcYu7W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“as easy of a decision as falling off a log”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jdIgNP"&gt;“We’re actually not adding a whole new layer of people,” NASA deputy administrator Pam Melroy told reporters after the town hall, addressing critiques of the move. “There are very few additional positions that will be required... the challenges that we have in coordinating across organizations is exactly the same as it is today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="496HUu"&gt;“Both of these people are extremely qualified,” Nelson told reporters. “It was obvious, it was common sense, that Kathy’s success should continue in the space operations mission directorate.” Employing a southern colloquialism, he added his decision to pick Lueders and Free for the roles “was as easy of a decision as falling off a log.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8kXMW"&gt;Studies conducted by NASA’s senior leadership under the Trump administration, when Nelson’s predecessor Jim Bridenstine was leading NASA, recommended a similar idea: NASA should spin-off elements related to its ambitious Artemis program into a separate directorate with its own leadership, giving it the focus and resources it’d need to execute an ambitious timeline of putting astronauts on the Moon by 2024. That advice was shelved at the time, current and former officials say, partially because it subtracted resources from other directorates, which frustrated members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPnKgM"&gt;But now, growing activity in the commercial space arena and the increasing cadence of human space travel, as SpaceX’s recent all-civilian mission to orbit last week showed, warrant changes to how NASA has managed its biggest human spaceflight programs for nearly a decade, NASA’s senior leadership say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="20yM5I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How are we going to manage this huge change in scope?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yJkDjk"&gt;“The last decade has seen extraordinary change and growth,” Melroy said at the town hall. “The impact that NASA has had on commercial space has created new capabilities that we didn’t even know we could rely on.” Citing future development plans with NASA’s long-delayed and over-budget Space Launch System, which is poised to launch for the first time later this year or early next year, Melroy added: “This is exactly the time for us to take a deep breath and say, ‘Wow, we have a chain of development programs, no longer just one monolithic program. How are we going to manage this huge change in scope?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTgxG2"&gt;NASA’s Artemis program includes a wide range of technologies that fall under the now-decentralized human exploration directorate. SpaceX is developing its Starship system to send NASA’s first astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024 (that will probably get delayed). A new space station called Gateway that will orbit the Moon is in the works by a team of international partners. Lockheed Martin is building NASA’s Orion crew capsule to help astronauts get to the Moon. NASA’s Space Launch System, a behemoth rocket largely managed by Boeing, has been under construction for more than a decade to launch the Orion capsule to Gateway, where SpaceX’s Starship will pick up astronauts and land on the lunar surface. Artemis is a multibillion-dollar fandango, and until today, all of it sat next to other routine programs like the ISS, a $100 billion orbital research post that has housed rotating crews of international astronauts for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRFYTy"&gt;“This approach allows one mission directorate to operate in space, while the other builds space systems,” Melroy said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus announces new streaming bundle with Showtime included</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oq7oCIktf5EbPocBStxir0Mk8Dg=/32x0:992x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890216/ParamountPlus_Showtime_Hero_1024x640.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZi8L7"&gt;Paramount Plus announced today that it’s launching a new streaming bundle for both its ad-supported and premium tiers that include Showtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcanPs"&gt;Paramount Plus offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;two subscription options&lt;/a&gt;: a pared-down essential plan with limited ads for $5 per month and an ad-free premium plan for $10 per month. ViacomCBS’s Showtime is offering the bundle at special introductory pricing of $10 per month and $13 per month, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfmTG8"&gt;Like other services similarly looking to lure subscribers by offering, for example, limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685091/netflix-free-android-plan-kenya"&gt;free-to-stream content&lt;/a&gt; or slashed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544099/apple-tv-plus-one-year-free-ending-three-months"&gt;promotional pricing&lt;/a&gt;, Paramount Plus hopes the package will help it win new customers. Tom Ryan, president and CEO of ViacomCBS streaming, said the company expects the “competitively priced bundle to only further expand the reach of both services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9x59t"&gt;It is, to be clear, a pretty good deal — at least at the bundle’s promotional pricing. Showtime’s own ad-free streaming service costs $11 a month after a 30-day trial period. It’s unclear how much the bundle will cost after the introductory fees, though. A spokesperson said post-promo would be announced at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWPh6W"&gt;In any event, if you do happen to be paying for Paramount Plus and are looking to swipe Showtime at a pretty steep discount, now’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get iOS 15 right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4621G9VcG1A83UwdytSuZtJWvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890176/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvuWwU"&gt;iOS 15 is finally here, and while it can’t be called a revolutionary update, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;enough cool new features&lt;/a&gt; that you may not want to wait until Apple notifies you that the update is ready. It’s easy enough to get the update without waiting, though. Here’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JN0zOp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22673693/iphone-apple-backup-ios-icloud"&gt;Your phone is backed up&lt;/a&gt;, right? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdmYBQ"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7duHTw"&gt;Give it a moment. If the update is ready for you, it may appear on your update screen. In that case, tap on “Install Now.” You’ll probably be asked for your passcode and will have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NwBlhb7wPAfb-e43zShyRdsfrgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867904/IMG_0B14C4232371_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqhwew1GrHnrbZIA-mooQyPfI3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867905/IMG_A3F1E73A0B91_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="elnD7Z"&gt;If you don’t see the update, look toward the bottom and tap on “Upgrade to iOS 15” &amp;gt; “Download and Install.” (The latter may appear automatically.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BUQygG"&gt;Type in your passcode if prompted, agree to those “Terms and Conditions,” and wait while the upload begins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OK6qhj"&gt;It will take a while to update your iPhone. So put the phone down, go do something relaxing, and then come back in a little while to your brand new OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8sY8Xy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTdSQo"&gt;Twitch is attempting to mend fences with a big pillar of the music industry by announcing an agreement to “work together” with the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA). Details are vague right now, but the agreement says they plan to “build productive partnerships between the service and music publishers” after a year of conflict over music rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXHKXS"&gt;Twitch has long had a contentious relationship with the music industry, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534983/riaa-copyright-twitch-streamers-licensing-letter"&gt;has accused the company&lt;/a&gt; of allowing streamers to play copyrighted music without the appropriate licenses. Streamers have come under the eye of music publishers as well, with some being subject to waves of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in Twitch deleting content from their channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKp9nF"&gt;The Amazon-owned streaming service is now attempting to appease both groups, with the agreement suggesting there could be new business opportunities for publishers down the road and fewer takedown notices for streamers. Neither is guaranteed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HoNNNc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a new reporting process rights holders can opt in to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCU2nK"&gt;The one tangible announcement here is a new — and potentially more forgiving — reporting process that music publishers can use to flag songs being used without a license in someone’s stream. The idea of this, in part, is to “address when creators inadvertently or incidentally use music in their streams,” according to a press release. This process starts with a warning instead of immediate penalties, according to Twitch, which could address critiques from streamers who had their content deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BuhzG"&gt;That said, this new process is &lt;em&gt;separate&lt;/em&gt; from the one in place for the DMCA, and it does not change Twitch’s rules about how music can be used on the platform. And &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9633425/twitch-nmpa-music-publishers-agreement"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Twitch isn’t paying for additional music licenses as part of the deal, so it’s unclear exactly how much will change as a result of this new partnership. If publishers opt in to the new process, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; resolve DMCA issues. But since that requires the rights holders to opt in and use it instead of the traditional takedown notice, we just don’t know yet if that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ptWik"&gt;The rest of the deal promises some grand partnerships — “from virtual shows to studio sessions, the partnerships stemming from this agreement will connect the Twitch community in many ways to the music they enjoy” — but we don’t have a great idea of what it all amounts to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9y4Cs"&gt;The agreement indicates Twitch is at least attempting to resolve some of the issues with licensed music on the platform — and, ideally, ease some of the burden from streamers who get punished for playing music on their channel. But right now, we just don’t know how much of an impact the deal will have.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is reportedly closing in on its biggest acquisition ever — the Roald Dahl catalog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0Q6WAWoZOdi0eRhr1bmOt0bZ1Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890125/RD_NETFLIX_LH_V009__0_00_07_21_20181127_5885_fizs41.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0888VS"&gt;Nearly three years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114572/netflix-animated-adaptations-willy-wonka-matilda-bfg-roald-dahl-books"&gt;Netflix signed a deal with The Roald Dahl Story Company&lt;/a&gt; to create a universe of animated features based on the author’s books,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/netflix-is-said-to-be-nearing-deal-to-buy-roald-dahl-catalog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports the streamer is in talks to buy the works outright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ElJ737"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reed Hastings and the Giant Acquisition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w8zHLF"&gt;There’s no word on exactly how much it costs to own Willy Wonka, the BFG, Matilda, and all the rest, but in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflixs-roald-dahl-deal-could-create-tv-universe-1164419/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; sources claiming that simply licensing 16 titles from the catalog cost Netflix more than $100 million. A deal for this catalog would likely rank as Netflix’s largest, and if it’s close enough that an announcement is possible within “days,” as the report suggests, we could hear more during Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;Tudum fan event this weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OB1nK0"&gt;Under the current deal, Taika Waititi is &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/taika-waititi-netflix-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-animated-series-willy-wonka-oompa-loompa-1203524577/"&gt;working on Roald Dahl animated series projects for Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, covering &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory &lt;/em&gt;and its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&lt;/em&gt;. That’s in addition to two different versions of Matilda, including a film version of &lt;em&gt;Matilda the Musical&lt;/em&gt; and an animated series, plus plans to make a&lt;em&gt; The BFG&lt;/em&gt; cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9mWcX"&gt;At those costs, it’s clear why Netflix might be ready to pay whatever it costs to secure rights to those properties long-term. If the deal is closed, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes it will happen despite the shadow cast by Dahl’s history of antisemitic statements and sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2018/11/i-d-still-read-roald-dahl-s-books-my-children-we-can-t-forget-he-was-anti-semite"&gt;misogynistic storytelling&lt;/a&gt;. The Dahl Family and the Roald Dahl Story Company &lt;a href="https://www.roalddahl.com/global/rdsc-and-family-notice"&gt;released an apology&lt;/a&gt; for the remarks in 2020, saying, “We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words.”&lt;/p&gt;
