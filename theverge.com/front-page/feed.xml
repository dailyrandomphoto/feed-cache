  &lt;p&gt;From cult films to VR experiences&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="RTOjvG"&gt;This year, the iconic Sundance Film Festival isn’t being held in beautiful Park City, Utah. Instead, as with most events around the world, the 2021 edition is a remote film festival. Luckily, even with the change in format, there’s still plenty to explore, from insightful documentaries to creative features by new directors to clever virtual reality experiences. This year’s edition includes cult films like the Nic Cage movie &lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the trippy animated flick &lt;em&gt;Cryptozoo&lt;/em&gt;; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pandemic-related stories &lt;em&gt;The Pink Cloud&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;In The Same Breath&lt;/em&gt;. We’ll be attending the festival virtually, so stay tuned for the latest reviews and analysis right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cryptozoo’s stunning animation isn’t enough to save it from a meandering story </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mTK_0gJ3guANW4fp1tpITc-PU8=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751885/50690769438_ef49dd59c5_k.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZ4eI3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most recent events, the 2021 edition of the Sundance Film Festival has shifted from an in-person showcase to a virtual one. Despite the change, we’ll still be bringing you reviews on the most interesting experiences we find, from indie films to VR experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUjS98"&gt;Halfway through&lt;em&gt; Cryptozoo&lt;/em&gt;, a hypnotizing and beautiful animated film about classic cryptid creatures, the somewhat meandering story becomes apparent. And it’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mx6013"&gt;Dash Shaw’s latest feature takes place in a fictional world where cryptids — mythical creatures like the kraken, Loch Ness monster, and Bigfoot — are feared and hunted by humans. In an effort to try to protect the creatures from being killed, two people operate a sanctuary that keeps cryptids safe. Lauren (voiced by Lake Bell) and Joan (Grace Zabriskie) make it their lifelong duty to ensure each known cryptid is brought to the sanctuary, protecting them from militant hunters like Nick (Thomas Jay Ryan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNY2K6"&gt;The story centers on Lauren’s quest to find the Baku, a dream-eating creature who helped her when she was a child, but Nick and his team want to capture the Baku because he believes it will finally stop left-wing protests. Their fight will bring them back to Cryptozoo and lead to realizations about trying to keep a group of hunted individuals safe by removing them from society and keeping them behind glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4opuL"&gt;If the messaging sounds heavy-handed, that’s because it is. &lt;em&gt;Cryptozoo &lt;/em&gt;never lets up on its inherently positive but maladroit ideas: animals should not be mistreated, cages inherently do more harm than good, and capitalism is bad. Messaging is used in place of building a foundation for emotional storytelling and characters to care about. That only works for so long; gorgeous animated sequences interwoven with powerful messaging create small bursts of emotional impact, but the film feels like it’s muddling from one beat to the next until the final half hour, which transforms into an exciting, action-packed sequence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MClVj"&gt;Normally, a movie about cryptids can exist simply on arresting imagery and / or chaotic action sequences and violence. The very nature of cryptids means exploring stories of beastly creatures and learning about the beautiful mythology they innately encompass. &lt;em&gt;Cryptozoo&lt;/em&gt;’s creatures are sympathetic to outsiders, caught trying to live a peaceful life and escape those who hate them for how they look or want to exploit them to feed a capitalist machine. This is when &lt;em&gt;Cryptozoo &lt;/em&gt;is at its best: trying to showcase how good-hearted people can sometimes get caught up in the same machine. The sanctuary will have hot dog booths, merchandise, stores, and sell tickets to ensure everything can remain running. The very nature of trying to make cryptids feel normal and protected leads them to feeling imprisoned and gawked at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0G2TA"&gt;This doesn’t save the film from its weaker moments, though. &lt;em&gt;Cryptozoo &lt;/em&gt;is frustrating because the ingredients are all there, but the end result is dry and empty. Its messaging is reliant on people caring about the Baku, about Joan and Lauren’s mission, about the various cryptids who join the mission along the way. Shaw tries to spend enough time with each cryptid, but they often feel forgettable and secondary to Lauren’s overall emotional arc. For a movie about how cryptids aren’t seen enough by humans for who they really are, I wish the movie spent more time on building up their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung drops Galaxy Z Flip 5G price $250, but it’s still expensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1rEv6nMTrS-68XftPrhm4NwTgY=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751847/Galaxy_Z_Flip_5G_Mystic_Bronze_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HZ6H7K"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/buy/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dropped the price of its folding flip phone&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, by $250. It’s now $1,199.99, which, on its face, looks like a fairly big drop from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333566/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-announced-price-release-date-1449-99"&gt;original asking price of $1,449.99 in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptu2Ng"&gt;However, there are two things to keep in mind about the price change. First, this phone is about six months old and is the same design as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;non-5G version released last February&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung phones are famous for seeing early and aggressive deals; now that trend is hitting its folding phones, too. So while a price drop is nice to see, it’s not exactly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXvEby"&gt;Second, $1,200 is still very expensive for a phone that has essentially the same specs and functionality as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Galaxy S20 FE 5G&lt;/a&gt;, which can be had for $700 (or less if you can find a deal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3JJGe"&gt;The news of the price drop comes after Samsung’s president of mobile, TM Roh, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;promised to make folding phones&lt;/a&gt; “more accessible to everyone” in 2021. It also comes after Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253844/samsung-earnings-q4-fy-2020-profits-covid-display-mobile"&gt;latest earnings announcement&lt;/a&gt; in which it said it would expand its portfolio of foldable products — specifically citing that it plans an “expansion of the foldable category including the Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MgH2z"&gt;We were already expecting a new version of the Z Fold (which opens up to the size of a small tablet) sometime this year with support for styluses, but it’s unclear when Samsung may release that. As for the Z Flip, it’s unclear what this price drop means for the timing of the next one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rb4SMW"&gt;But the biggest question around folding phones isn’t about when new ones will come; it’s about how much they will cost. While it’s definitely true that $1,200 is $250 less than $1,450, there’s still a very big price premium for customers who want their phones to fold down into smaller packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz0E0Y"&gt;The Z Flip is easily the best flip-style folding phone on the market, but it’s a small market. The only other viable competitor is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola Razr 5G&lt;/a&gt;, which, as of this writing, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-razr-gen-2%2Fp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260357%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has also been discounted&lt;/a&gt; to $1,200 from its original $1,400 asking price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bd6B9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21417432/foldable-phones-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-flip-5g-microsoft-duo"&gt;Folding phones are still luxury products&lt;/a&gt;, in other words. These flip phones cost nearly 50 percent more than comparable non-folding devices. It’s good to see the Z Flip 5G become “more accessible,” but unless that price difference can get smaller, folding phones will continue to be curiosities instead of mass-market devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g4OOeh"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fold, Flip, or Duo: why fold a phone?|95266" data-volume-uuid="df76ea051" data-volume-id="95266" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-156" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Facebook prompt will encourage ad tracking opt-in ahead of Apple’s privacy push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z68YP0IKo3HUEpIFV749ErIJVD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751770/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wU7A49"&gt;Facebook will begin showing a prompt on its mobile app for the iPhone and iPad that’s designed to convince users to allow ad tracking, in preparation for an upcoming privacy change in which Apple will force developers to obtain permission to track users across apps and websites in the future. The new screen, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/facebook-strikes-back-against-apple-ios-14-idfa-privacy-change.html"&gt;first reported on Monday by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, will be shown to users globally starting today and will provide Facebook will early data on how Apple’s privacy change might affect the social network’s business, ahead of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;planned update in early spring&lt;/a&gt; that will make the opt-in request mandatory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUuqg1"&gt;The prompt will give users a page of information detailing why Facebook thinks a user should give the company permission to track them on iOS. The company argues doing so will make ads more personalized and help support businesses that rely on advertising. Apple’s upcoming change, which it first detailed at its developer conference last year, will let users opt out of letting apps collect the so-called Identifier for Advertisers, or IDFA, code, which companies share with one another to track a user across apps and websites and to measure the effectiveness of digital ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RPd30e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple’s new prompt is designed to present a false tradeoff between personalized ads and privacy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHjX7V"&gt;Facebook has spent the last few months &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ios-14-apple-privacy-update-impacts-small-business-ads"&gt;citing the potential harm to small businesses&lt;/a&gt; posed by Apple’s new privacy measures, which Facebook says will lead to less effective advertising and potentially lower revenues. The company has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;taken out full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; railing against Apple’s changes, and both &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-f.html"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; have made a series of increasingly hostile public remarks against the other company’s business models. Now, Facebook says under App Store rules allowing developers to educate consumers, it’s using its new prompt “to help people make a more informed decision.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ghw1Dx"&gt;“Apple’s new prompt is designed to present a false tradeoff between personalized ads and privacy; when in fact, we can provide both. Apple is doing this to self-preference their own services and targeted advertising products,” a Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “To help people make a real choice, we’re also showing a screen of our own to provide more information about how we use personalized ads, which support small businesses and keep apps free. Agreeing to our screen doesn’t result in Facebook collecting new types of data; it just means that Facebook can continue to give people better experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k03wG3q_uPaExC2O-CCo7Jlx4bk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273120/106832756_1611957023306_Test_screens_FINAL.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qBP3d7"&gt;The prompt is intended to preface the system-level pop-up Apple will make mandatory in an upcoming iOS 14 release this spring. Notably, Facebook does not use the word tracking, but instead asks to “use your apps and website activity,” while the Apple pop-up that follows spells out that Facebook is asking for permission to “track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.” Developers have been able to ask for permission since the release of the new operating system last fall. Yet few have done so, while Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation of the opt-in requirement&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTLxHy"&gt;In this case, however, Facebook is asking for permission early in an effort to prepare itself for what may be a substantial amount of its users who decline to opt into ad tracking. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-looks-to-take-its-fight-with-apple-to-court"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, some internal estimates at the company predict fewer than 20 percent of Facebook users agreeing to allow tracking on iOS. Regardless of the choice a user makes if they see the pop-up today or sometime in the next few weeks, Facebook intends to honor the choice when Apple makes the opt-in requirement mandatory, according to CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford says ‘millions’ of its vehicles will run on Google’s Android starting in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9KVZpsAQlaDQlAyLoMCMfbWiVc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751501/sokane_191117_3793_6040.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="43NCei"&gt;Ford is the latest automaker to turn its vehicle operating systems over to Google. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will use Google’s Android to power the infotainment systems in “millions” of its cars starting in 2023. That means Google’s voice-activated Assistant, Google Maps, and other automotive-approved Android apps will be available in Ford’s cars without requiring the use of an Android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnXAAe"&gt;The deep integration of Android will allow drivers and passengers to use Google Assistant to change things like climate settings, and it will also enable over-the-air updates that can add new features or address some maintenance issues, according to Ford. But iPhone people, don’t despair: Ford’s system will still be compatible with Apple CarPlay. And Ford will continue to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14173324/ford-amazon-echo-alexa-integration-ces-2017"&gt;Amazon’s Alexa&lt;/a&gt; as an option as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="521SjQ"&gt;Ford wouldn’t say which of its vehicles will get the Android operating system starting in 2023, only that “millions” of vehicles under the Ford and Lincoln brands would have it. The vehicles will be available across the globe except in China. But Ford wouldn’t say whether it will use Google’s Android Automotive product, which is embedded natively in the vehicle. Instead, its use of Android would be “uniquely Ford and Lincoln,” Ford’s VP of strategy and partnerships, David McClelland, said in a conference call with reporters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y6CCon"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Uniquely Ford and Lincoln”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DBTCso"&gt;In addition, Ford is signing a six-year partnership with Google to use the tech giant’s Cloud as its preferred cloud provider for its connected vehicle services. And Ford and Google will create a new group, comprised of employees from both companies, called Team Upshift that will be tasked with finding other areas of innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLgyy7"&gt;“We’re going to leverage the talent and assets of both companies to push the boundaries of Ford’s transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities,” McClelland said in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ford/d6bd49bf497b"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt;. “This may include projects ranging from modernizing our plants through vision AI, developing new retail experiences when buying a vehicle, creating new ownership offers based on connected vehicle data, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3wp9rW3kXCYdRx50eoKtfPPRuhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22273134/Ford_GooglePrtnship_Page_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MUJBu5"&gt;It’s a major coup for Google, which has been flexing its muscles by adding a number of major automakers to its stable of customers using Android in its vehicles. Ford joins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906777/volvo-xc40-suv-ev-native-android-auto-google-assistant-maps"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan-google/renault-nissan-adopts-android-in-coup-for-google-idUSKCN1LY0RO"&gt;Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in striking a deal with Google to use its software to power its vehicle infotainment services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myqaes"&gt;But it can also be a slippery slope. Initially, car companies seemed to want &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14268252/apple-carplay-google-android-auto-vs-carmakers"&gt;to keep big tech companies at arm’s length&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from tapping into the lucrative customer data streams flowing in and out of their vehicles. But Ford figures that by letting Google under the hood, it can probably sell more cars to customers who would prefer a more smartphone-like in-car experience than the software currently provided by the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cmhFWK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s unclear where this leaves Ford’s Sync infotainment system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d2mYF2"&gt;It’s unclear where this leaves Ford’s Sync infotainment system. All of the automaker’s most recent models, such as the recently released Mustang Mach-E, run on Sync 4 to power such features as navigation, radio, and climate settings. In a conference call with reporters, McClelland said Sync was a “differentiated brand” that was operating in millions of vehicles, but he wouldn’t directly address the future of the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YFs4h"&gt;“SYNC is our connected vehicle brand and we are building on its popularity,” a spokesperson said in response to a follow up question about the fate of Ford’s OS. “It currently sits on the [Blackberry] QNX OS that will shift to the Android OS as part of the detail – just can’t get into other ’23 details yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtUxG8"&gt;Ford shouldn’t have to abandon Sync altogether, given the flexibility afforded by Google’s native Android Automotive system. This approach allows Google to do more of the heavy lifting on the software side, while leaving the automakers with the freedom to design the OS to match their tastes. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;embedded Android system on the Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, which is made by Volvo and Geely, looks a lot like Volvo’s Sensus infotainment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baKiaF"&gt;There have been other major pairings between car companies and tech firms in recent weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238407/microsoft-cruise-self-driving-investment-azure-cloud"&gt;Microsoft and GM’s self-driving subsidiary Cruise&lt;/a&gt; announced recently that it would be teaming up to speed the development of self-driving cars. And &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hyundai-motor-apple/apple-hyundai-set-to-agree-electric-car-tie-up-says-korea-it-news-idUSKBN29F0C1"&gt;Apple is rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be in talks with Hyundai about a similar partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zm9yR"&gt;It’s an interesting development in the relationship between the nation’s oldest automakers and its biggest tech company. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/11/10750524/ford-google-alphabet-self-driving-cars-wsj"&gt;Ford and Google were rumored&lt;/a&gt; to form a joint venture around autonomous vehicles back in 2016, but it never panned out. Although the JV never materialized, the two companies kept things open-ended and clearly, given today’s news, never lost touch with one another. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prisoners of the Ghostland is destined to be the next Nic Cage cult movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9O_KurJPJW2l5WSGsZaA5gM8ys0=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751420/50665765858_881fae4644_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo. Sundance Institute.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="98FVxB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most recent events, the 2021 edition of the Sundance Film Festival has shifted from an in-person showcase to a virtual one. Despite the change, we’ll still be bringing you reviews and insight on the most interesting experiences we find, from indie films to VR experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYu8VX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt; seems like a movie made for Nicolas Cage. It’s the English language debut from prolific Japanese director Sion Sono — Western audiences might know him best from the strange and gruesome series &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Vampire Hotel&lt;/em&gt; on Amazon Prime Video — and it mashes together elements of Westerns, samurai films, and post-apocalyptic action movies. Cage’s genre work has become a genre itself, thanks to cult hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/22/16917074/sundance-2018-mandy-movie-review-nicolas-cage-panos-cosmatos-horror"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Color Out of Space&lt;/em&gt;. So on the surface, it sounds like a perfect match — but &lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt; never manages to rise to the level of its cast or premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZSThO"&gt;The premise is, admittedly, incredible. Cage, playing a hardened criminal known only as Hero, is enlisted by a man called the Governor to rescue his granddaughter from a treacherous, and possibly supernatural, place called the Ghostland. But he takes some elaborate precautions, as Hero is infamous for eluding capture. Cage’s character is outfitted with a leather suit full of explosives and a questionable array of sensors. If he motions as if to attack a woman, for instance, a bomb in the arm will explode. Likewise, if he gets, too, uh, excited, a bomb in his crotch will detonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHssmH"&gt;The world, meanwhile, pulls from a variety of inspirations to create some visually beautiful sets. Sheriffs in cowboy hats mingle with sword-wielding rōnin, and the Ghostland itself is like a trippier version of a &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt;-style wasteland, complete with a strange cult that turns humans into mannequins and fights to keep the hands on a giant clock from moving so that time will stand still. When the people of the Ghostland see Hero for the first time, they inexplicably start chanting about his “thick, red blood.” It’s a strange and disorienting world, and it’s a lot of fun just to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMnzdk"&gt;Unfortunately, the premise and worldbuilding largely feel wasted on a movie that doesn’t live up to either. For starters, there’s the star performer. Arguably, the main draw of this movie is Cage at his most Cage: manic, wild, overacting. But his performance is disappointing. For the most part, he’s just angry, but not the kind of fun-angry that makes a B-movie enjoyable. There’s an uncomfortable rage as he yells “I’ll karate chop you!” at a crowd of strangers or screams at the woman he’s rescuing to undress. There are a few fun bits of dialogue — most notable is Cage bellowing the word “testicle!” in front of a big audience — but they’re far too rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqcIO5"&gt;And then there’s the story, which is completely incomprehensible. This isn’t always a bad thing, as there are plenty of genre flicks where the narrative is just an excuse for cool action scenes, but that’s not the case here. (The only interesting fight sequence happens at the very end of the movie.) Instead, &lt;em&gt;Ghostland&lt;/em&gt; overwhelms you with story elements, yet, somehow, things never get any clearer. The narrative is both underdeveloped &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; overexplained. There are copious flashbacks, dream sequences, and even a scene involving a literal slideshow presentation on the horrors of toxic waste. All these do is serve to complicate what should be a straightforward story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0LzFi"&gt;Really, this is a movie that gets in its own way. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to watch Nic Cage in an explosive leather suit digging through the wreckage of a post-industrial wasteland while fighting off samurai, cowboys, crazed cults, and toxic zombies. I mean, who doesn’t? But &lt;em&gt;Ghostland&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t give you enough of that. Instead, you have to wade through needlessly long exposition and far too many “weird for the sake of weird” moments to get to the good stuff. It’s still a movie destined to achieve cult status based on its premise alone. But when you head to a theater years from now to indulge in a marathon of Cage’s best genre work, this definitely won’t be the headliner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike’s hands-free Go FlyEase shoes look very comfy and just the right amount of ridiculous</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NAYE3Egw6muguPOMAL_Lfdfr3UY=/45x0:555x340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751383/Flyease_Loop_original.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nike&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0gROEF"&gt;Nike is pushing the envelope of shoe technology further with today’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.nike.com%2Fnews%2Fnike-better-is-temporary-book-release&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F2%2F1%2F22260179%2Fnike-go-flyease-shoes-hands-free-pricing-release-day#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announcement of the Go FlyEase&lt;/a&gt;, a contact-less $120 shoe for both athletic and everyday use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKeUNq"&gt;The core innovation here is a so-called bistable hinge that lets the shoe move between two positions: an upright one in which the inner sole of the shoe sits at a roughly 30-degree angle so you can easily slip your foot in, and the collapsed position in which the outer layer sits snugly around the inner one while you walk or run. It is effectively two shoes in one, with the inner shoe popping out as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vkpqd5"&gt;The concept comes from the standard motion most people make when taking off slip-on shoes like Crocs, slippers, or plain old loose sneakers that involves using one foot to pull down on the heel of the other, &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90599458/nikes-new-flyease-go-shoes-snap-right-onto-your-feet?partner=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+fastcodesign%2Ffeed+%28Co.Design%29"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With the Go FlyEase’s “kickstand heel,” this motion lets you slip out of the shoes while simultaneously sliding the hinge to prop them up. The whole process is hands-free, Nike says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1l7d7J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10313646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rWKF2M"&gt;There’s more than just the aesthetic and laziness appeal here, too. Nike designed these with accessibility in mind, meaning they’re great options for people who might otherwise have trouble bending over to tie their shoes or struggle with the act of tying shoelaces. The FlyEase brand was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002197/nike-flyease-zipper-disabilities"&gt;born from Nike designer Tobie Hatfield&lt;/a&gt;, who’s spent years at Nike developing ever-more ingenious accessibility-first shoes at the request of people with disabilities. This effort has occasionally produced some flashy, high-profile products like the self-lacing &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt;-inspired shoes, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9581329/nike-back-to-the-future-shoes-marty-mcfly-air-mag"&gt;Nike Mag&lt;/a&gt;, and more modern self-lacing variants like the &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2016/9/21/12998474/buy-nike-self-lacing-shoes-hyperadapt-1"&gt;HyperAdapt 1.0&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18167388/nike-self-lacing-shoes-adapt-bb-smart-bluetooth-app-features-battery-life-price-release-date"&gt;Adapt BB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yNWuS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;, which tried the Go FlyEase and says the shoes are indeed mighty comfy,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;also aptly describes the shoes as “the ultimate COVID footwear.” Frankly, I’m already obsessing over snagging a pair — not just because they look quite nice aesthetically, but also because they really do seem like the perfect pair of shoes for a leisurewear age when going out means doing the bare minimum required to leave my remote work bunker of an apartment for an errand or some fresh air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26z839"&gt;Nike says the shoe will go on sale starting on February 15th “for select Nike Members,” although it’s unclear how many units will be made available in the first run. The company says “broader consumer availability” is planned for later in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Democrats keep their promise to decriminalize marijuana?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On His Racial Equity Agenda And Signs Executive Actions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8ZUsGF2F2RrLeZd27_NHePrqkY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751261/1230804840.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eMuAim"&gt;Just a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable for a major political party to call for decriminalizing marijuana — but in 2020, the Democrats did just that. Approved in August, the platform called for decriminalizing and rescheduling marijuana through executive action, with support for legalizing medical marijuana and expunging past criminal convictions for cannabis-related offenses all on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wf8Wk"&gt;“Democrats believe no one should be in prison solely because they use drugs,” the platform states. “Democrats will decriminalize marijuana use and reschedule it through executive action on the federal level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwYaLn"&gt;A lot has changed since August, and the first few weeks of the Biden administration have been consumed with trillion-dollar stimulus plans and the pending impeachment of Donald Trump. But decriminalizing marijuana is still a pivotal issue for millions of Americans, with &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/22/four-in-ten-u-s-drug-arrests-in-2018-were-for-marijuana-offenses-mostly-possession/"&gt;more than half a million arrests for marijuana possession&lt;/a&gt; each year. And while advocates are willing to accept a delay, there’s mounting pressure on President Joe Biden to ensure decriminalization doesn’t fall off the agenda entirely — and mounting anxiety about whether the new president will make good on his party’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cSGFev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden was once a leading voice in the War on Drugs &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R0BqwR"&gt;Advocates argue the timing has never been better for decriminalization, between last summer’s criminal justice protests and a slow-but-steady rise in support. A recent Gallup poll showed &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx"&gt;68 percent of Americans support legalization&lt;/a&gt;, the highest figure since Gallup started polling the issue in 1969. In November, voters approved new cannabis laws in four states — and in December, the Democrats in the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/04/house-poised-to-vote-to-decriminalize-marijuana/"&gt;passed the MORE Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would have legalized marijuana and expunged the criminal records of people convicted of marijuana-related crimes. (The bill died in the Senate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeN9Pj"&gt;But to make good on pledges of executive action, decriminalization advocates will need support from the White House, not just Congress — and Biden’s position is much less clear. The White House did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about whether Biden would move forward with the reforms outlined in the Democrats’ 2020 platform — but there’s plenty in his background to make activists worried. Biden was once a leading voice in the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration"&gt;War on Drugs of the 1980s and ’90s&lt;/a&gt;, although he changed his position on marijuana during the 2020 campaign. Candidate Biden went from not supporting legalization at all to supporting decriminalizing the drug and leaving it up to states whether to allow recreational use by the time he was the Democrats’ 2020 nominee. Most importantly, Biden said he would “reschedule cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTXMPl"&gt;Despite Biden’s mixed messages, legalization advocates think the issue is too popular and urgent for Biden to ignore. “I think the Biden administration agrees with us, at least on the piece of expunging past records,” says Maritza Perez, director of the Office of National Affairs at the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance. “At this point, this is something the administration cannot ignore; this administration and this Congress have to do something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3BuXVQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Legalization advocates may have an ally in Vice President Kamala Harris&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VGumF8"&gt;The Drug Policy Alliance wants Biden to fully deschedule cannabis, with the focus on criminal justice reform. The alliance also wants Biden to reinstate an Obama-era policy that blocked federal law enforcement from taking action in states where marijuana was legal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tmmi3r"&gt;Perez also notes that legalization advocates may have an ally in Vice President Kamala Harris, a main sponsor of the MORE Act in the Senate, has been supportive of legalization in recent years. Like Biden, Harris’ views on legal weed have changed over time; in 2010, she opposed a ballot measure (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/us/politics/03ballot.html"&gt;which ultimately failed&lt;/a&gt;) to legalize cannabis in California. But in 2018, she co-sponsored Sen. Cory Booker’s Marijuana Justice Act to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/politics/kamala-harris-cory-booker-legalizing-marijuana/index.html"&gt;legalize marijuana at the federal level&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because marijuana laws “are not applied and enforced the same way for all people,” she said at the time. And &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cannabis-stocks/weed-stocks-surge-as-kamala-harris-vows-to-decriminalize-pot-in-debate-idUKKBN26T3IH"&gt;Harris reiterated during the vice presidential debate&lt;/a&gt; with Mike Pence in October that a Biden-Harris administration would decriminalize marijuana and expunge past weed-related convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgQUbO"&gt;“She does have [Biden’s] ear on these issues of criminal justice and racial justice, so our hope is that she will be influencing the policy decisions,” Perez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="650jMK"&gt;But despite the overwhelming public sentiment favoring some kind of marijuana reform and a reasonable argument for moving weed into a less restricted drug category, the process for rescheduling is complicated and not something President Biden can just do on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7PHLb"&gt;John Hudak is deputy director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution and author of the book &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/book/marijuana-a-short-history/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marijuana: A Short History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which examines how the drug went from a counterculture novelty to the mainstream.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;He says Biden has made it clear he doesn’t support full-scale national legalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="la7MxW"&gt;“We’re not going to see Biden or the White House pushing for the MORE Act, or de-scheduling marijuana,” Hudak said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And even with Democrats in control of the Senate, the MORE Act likely doesn’t have the votes to beat a filibuster in that chamber, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Snprab"&gt;“There are two scenarios I see in which larger-scale cannabis reform becomes law,” Hudak said. “If Congressional Democrats slip something into a criminal justice bill, it would be impossible for Biden to veto just because it has cannabis reform in it. If that happens, it forces the president’s hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qBoBT"&gt;The other potential scenario, Hudak said, would be if Harris pushed Biden to take more of a public stance, if not take action, and “does to Joe Biden on cannabis what Biden did to Obama on same-sex marriage.” In 2012, then-Vice President &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/10/politics/obama-same-sex-marriage/index.html"&gt;Biden famously spoke out in favor of same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; ahead of President Obama, which compelled Obama to publicly express his support earlier than he had planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sBTWS"&gt;Another hurdle for decriminalization is the mechanics of rescheduling. Congress could reschedule the bill by amending the Controlled Substances Act directly, but with the filibuster still in place, such a bill would have trouble passing the deadlocked Senate. The more likely path would be through the attorney general, who can initiate a rescheduling after a review by the Food and Drug Administration or Drug Enforcement Administration. The goal would be to move marijuana from schedule 1 (which includes heroin and MDMA) to schedule 2 (which includes legal drugs like Vicodin and Adderall). That would allow marijuana to be prescribed and dispensed like any other prescription drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohzQUA"&gt;But Hudak is skeptical whether the FDA or DEA would go along with such a plan. The agencies have often refused to reexamine the scheduling when petitioned, and they’re expected to resist any efforts that would make marijuana more available. And while the attorney general could start the process to reschedule marijuana even if the FDA and DEA had recommended against it, it would be a politically risky move, making it that much more likely that Biden will steer clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qinr1m"&gt;A lot will depend on Biden’s pick for attorney general, Merrick Garland, who doesn’t have a lot in his judicial history indicating a position on marijuana policy. But as an appeals court judge, Garland sided with the DEA in &lt;a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/12CBD2B55C34FBF585257AFB00554299/%24file/11-1265-1416392.pdf"&gt;a high-profile 2013 case&lt;/a&gt; as the agency fended off a citizen’s group seeking to reschedule marijuana. As with any case, there were significant issues of precedent and agency discretion at play, but it’s another factor that has advocates nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nkwOCy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he’s working on a legalization bill&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qjLew5"&gt;There’s still an opportunity for Congress to lead on decriminalization — particularly if Biden doesn’t want to. Senate Majority Leader Chuck &lt;a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/"&gt;Schumer said in a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; he is working on a new federal marijuana legalization bill that lets states decide what to do and will take tax revenues from marijuana and put them toward investing in minority communities. Schumer &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marijuana%20Freedom%20and%20Opportunity%20Act.pdf"&gt;co-sponsored legislation to decriminalize cannabis&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, which also sought to create a trust fund for marijuana businesses owned by women and minorities. Perez says Schumer’s stance on marijuana reform is a hopeful sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJFda9"&gt;“If the most recent election showed us anything, it is that Americans on both sides of the aisle want a more compassionate, health-based approach to drugs over the punitive and racist systems of the past,” Perez said. Her organization has sent the Biden-Harris administration a &lt;a href="https://drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/dpa-2020-roadmap_0.pdf"&gt;list of priorities&lt;/a&gt; it wants to see addressed in the first 100 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkMdox"&gt;“We’re working just as hard as we were last year, and there are a lot of competing priorities,” Perez said. “But I feel like we’ll have an easier path this time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MLB The Show is coming to both PlayStation and Xbox consoles on April 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHv96JztiVSXXCYBNIsPT0y-FDo=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68751153/mt7n8pjsywpuomikztyd.10.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fkU00d"&gt;We already knew Sony’s beloved sports exclusive &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show &lt;/em&gt;would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21004103/sony-mlb-the-show-playstation-exclusivity-ending"&gt;release on “additional consoles”&lt;/a&gt; as early as 2021. Today, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/01/introducing-our-mlb-the-show-21-cover-athlete-fernando-tatis-jr/"&gt;Sony announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt; will release on April 20th on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFZ7nS"&gt;This is the first entry in the &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt; series that will release on Microsoft’s home consoles, but Sony isn’t just offering the game on the Xbox for the first time. &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt; 21 will also support full cross-platform progression, cross-saves, and online multiplayer between PlayStation and Xbox consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P2qG8P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MLB The Show launches day and date on PS4 and PS5 with cross-platform play on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Xbox&lt;/a&gt; One and Xbox Series X|S  &lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1356241272831438850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nOuUCx"&gt;Similar to other cross-gen titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403145/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-next-gen-price-playstation-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311250/nba-2k21-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-versions-70-dollars-next-gen-price-increase-games#:~:text=Share%20All%20sharing%20options%20for,a%20next%2Dgen%20price%20jump&amp;amp;text=2K%20Games%20has%20announced%20that,PS4%20versions%20of%20the%20game."&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt; will retail for different prices, depending on which version you buy. If you get the Standard Edition on PS4 or Xbox One, it will cost $60. On PS5 or Xbox Series X / S, it’ll cost $70, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8WBYa"&gt;If you purchase the Standard Edition on last-gen (PS4 or Xbox One) and upgrade to a next-gen console, you won’t be able to upgrade your copy of the game to the PS5 or Xbox Series X / S version. However, &lt;a href="https://theshow.com/faq/"&gt;Sony’s FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; revealed that if you buy the Collector’s Edition of &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21 &lt;/em&gt;for Xbox or PlayStation, you’ll receive both the current and next-gen versions of the game. Currently, there’s no pricing on the Collector’s Edition of the game, but more information will be announced on February 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhlHFD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;21 &lt;/em&gt;is a huge win for Xbox owners. In the past, if you wanted a good baseball game, you needed a PlayStation console to play one. In recent years, &lt;em&gt;RBI Baseball&lt;/em&gt; served as an alternative to Xbox players, but by splitting its focus between arcade and simulation styles, it's &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/4/17191164/rbi-baseball-18-review"&gt;never been a true contender&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-634" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $120 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-337" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$170 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-grade-a-refurbished-1?ref=mwj_cd_deal_7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$180 at Woot (Grade A Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

If that deal sells out, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c4f3f58040f1804eb1980afa134f1c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are offering these flagship earbuds for $200; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; has it for $210, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target is selling the AirPods Pros for $235&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
