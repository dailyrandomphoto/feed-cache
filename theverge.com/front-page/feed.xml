    <title>Does Avatar have a place in Disney’s ambitious future?</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WhtCqq"&gt;Disney announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;virtual avalanche&lt;/a&gt; of updates and news for almost every one of its properties. But one of the company’s biggest franchises was strangely absent: in all the hullabaloo, where was &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lXUJ0"&gt;There was no &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; segment of the investor call, showing off preview images of the sequels and a logo or subtitle for &lt;em&gt;Avatar 2&lt;/em&gt;. No news of any &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; Disney Plus shows, or any animated spinoffs to help further expand the brand across the Disney empire. Amid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;more than 50 announcements&lt;/a&gt; covering &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, and Pixar, the Na’vi were nowhere to be seen. Interconnected branding and stories has become Disney’s lifeblood, but &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;isn’t taking part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s0tHOR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 52 things Disney just announced","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pV4y7I"&gt;While not originally a Disney property, the studio acquired the rights to the James Cameron blockbuster alongside the rest of 20th Century Fox in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;2019’s landmark merger&lt;/a&gt;. The company has invested significantly in the &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;brand long before it owned the movies, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/27/15701562/pandora-world-of-avatar-disney-world-review"&gt;dedicated Pandora section&lt;/a&gt; of Disney World in 2017. On Disney Plus, the original &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;is a prominent fixture — and, until its dethroning by &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; last year, was one of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_box_office_records_set_by_Avatar"&gt;most lucrative films&lt;/a&gt; ever produced, with &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl876971521/"&gt;a $2.7 billion box office&lt;/a&gt;. 20th Century Studios — and, by extension, Disney — have four more &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;films in production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHIuxs"&gt;Between the inherited investment from 20th Century Fox into the future of Pandora, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15721206/disney-world-avatar-pandora-photo-tour-james-cameron"&gt;Disney’s own $500 million theme park&lt;/a&gt;, the blue aliens of James Cameron’s imagination take up a big role on the balance sheet, if nothing else. It’s a huge investment for the company to be silent about. Disney’s entire event was meant to prove to investors (and the world) that the Disney brand is strong. And yet, it didn’t provide a single piece of information about the sequels to the second biggest movie ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Avatar" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYKpaXy3YZzjXDUTJ9asspz0P2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/4529421/avatar16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 20th Century Fox&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RV6JUI"&gt;The first two sequels have been shooting concurrently for three years, and &lt;em&gt;Avatar 2&lt;/em&gt; — per Disney’s most recent theatrical release calendar — is still prominently on the schedule, for December 16th, 2022. And James Cameron’s sequels are set to alternate December slots each year with Disney’s other major sci-fi franchise, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. But while Disney was willing to announce a title card and details on its next &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; movie as far away as 2023 (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168682/patty-jenkins-star-wars-movie-rogue-sqaudrons-wonder-woman"&gt;the Patty Jenkins-helmed &lt;em&gt;Rogue Squadron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), the studio didn’t even mention the word “&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;” during the four-hour-plus presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MLlFFg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;’s cultural prominence has faded over the years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxlY8l"&gt;Part of the answer may lie in &lt;em&gt;Avatar’&lt;/em&gt;s depreciation following its record-shattering debut. For a film as big as &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; was in 2009, the movie itself has had a tiny impact on the overall cultural landscape disproportionate to its massive box office numbers. Other top films, like &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and the Avengers movies, are part of the modern zeitgeist. Even the most out-of-touch person knows who Iron Man is, or has an opinion on whether Jack and Rose could have fit on that board. &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;just doesn’t occupy the same place in people’s hearts, minds, or wallets anymore, outside of a far smaller subset of fans. It’s not clear it ever did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSZoZZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;’s cultural prominence has faded over the years. Viral &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxp1IBK1OPI"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/avatar?utm_term=.wmvPPK7LE#.lwxEEw8Mo"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; trying to recall the details of the film have more prominence than the characters or worlds that the film so meticulously created. And &lt;em&gt;Avatar’&lt;/em&gt;s paint-by-numbers story and focus on a white savior narrative have aged particularly poorly when viewed with fresh eyes that aren’t blinded by the fantastical computer-generated sights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRbEps"&gt;It’s an open question whether an &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; sequel will be able to gross anything close to the original, which had the advantage of riding the dual waves of inflated 3D movie tickets and immersive CGI hype, neither of which are benefits a second movie, over a decade later, will have. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61N_XAtTL2EnghFnRgUjIa84K5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8609241/jbareham_170524_1720_A_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0nhNU1"&gt;And yet, &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; didn’t gross $2.7 billion out of apathy toward the franchise. With Cameron’s reputation, it could be that he’ll manage to make lightning strike a third time, but with the huge price tags for the films, it’s a big gamble. (Disney itself hadn’t decided whether to greenlight Cameron’s fourth and fifth films when it first acquired the franchise.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oq0hCR"&gt;Disney’s investor call announcements were a blueprint for the company’s future. That path is one built firmly on its strengths: popular brands like Marvel, Pixar, and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, expansions of modern animated classics like &lt;em&gt;Moana&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, and shows that remake or further build out beloved properties like &lt;em&gt;The Mighty Ducks&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CpIDIe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Disney finally revealed the real Disney Plus ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169873/disney-plus-streaming-marvel-star-wars-new-shows-movies-star-hulu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sTQ6hK"&gt;In other words, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169873/disney-plus-streaming-marvel-star-wars-new-shows-movies-star-hulu"&gt;Disney’s future is committed to franchises and brands&lt;/a&gt; that customers love. It’s a calculated, measured approach, the thing that separates it from the scattershot tactics of Netflix’s hundreds of original shows and movies that flare up into the spotlight for a few days or weeks and are then forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MQm9o"&gt;It’s hard to believe that Disney hasn’t thought about how to better integrate the &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; franchise into its own stable of brands. But if &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; isn’t in the spotlight as part of Disney’s future, it might be because the company has recognized that in 2020 (and beyond), the world of Pandora and the Na’vi just can’t measure up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The entertainment that got us through 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2GQ_3g8kTGxuTYHhIfZy7omhlNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509386/acastro_201211_4335_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Seeking comfort in old favorites&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9GpZMW"&gt;If there is one peculiar comfort to 2020, it’s the knowledge that misery was universal. Rattling off the many reasons why feels redundant. We all know the score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4pO5K"&gt;This year was an exercise in coping with no wrong answer: whether it was Zoom parties, TikTok, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, YouTube yoga, bread baking, or any of the countless other activities people used to pass the time, each one offered some sort of escape. At &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,  we found our own comfort through movies, games, music, art, and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nuBQlN"&gt;“The Difference” by Flume feat. Toro y Moi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lSysY6"&gt;Released on March 13th, just days before San Francisco would become the first US city to issue a shelter-in-place order, “The Difference” by electronic music producer Flume featuring singer-songwriter Toro y Moi inadvertently became an early but resilient quarantine anthem for me. It features Chaz Bear’s unmistakable vocals over an uncharacteristic high-tempo drum-and-bass beat from the Australian producer, all married together with some heavily engineered vocal chops and swelling synths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7fzKD5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCRiUi28UpA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ap0dfA"&gt;“It’s another world that I’ve gotta get a grip of and hold onto,” is Bear’s refrain in the final chorus, and it felt like a fitting little line to tell myself as everything I knew and enjoyed about my life on the West Coast began to fade. As each day bled into the next and the cycle of waking up, rolling out of bed, and staring at a computer screen and nothing else for nine hours began to take its toll, I would put my headphones in, put this song on, and skateboard to Alamo Square Park in the center of the city. There I would get mildly intoxicated sitting on the grass six feet apart from my friends and circuitously return to talking about positive case numbers and wondering aloud when the world would get back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prNY2L"&gt;I no longer live in San Francisco, having fled the high rents and slow, coronavirus-accelerated cultural decay of the city after seven years, for my hometown, in the far less warm-weathered western New York. But “The Difference” is still with me as a reminder of how music can help you mark time and also lose track of it. Here’s to hoping I’ll get to hear it played live, somewhere at some point in the future. —Nick Statt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TnZmQl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zJLM6N"&gt;One of my goals for the summer had been to spend more time hiking. By the time it got warm, it was clear that wasn’t happening. I spent April cat-sitting for a friend, wearing bike gloves and a construction mask to walk three blocks to the grocery store, trying to stretch out each load for as long as I could so as to limit exposure. I spent most of my time there on his PlayStation 4, playing &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; instead of going outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hQJ9C"&gt;I hadn’t played a AAA open-world game since GTA 4, when the limited hardware meant you could only see a few blocks into the distance. A couple console generations later, the world had gotten a whole lot bigger. Now I could climb a Tallneck and see for miles, or scale Pitch Cliff and see whole ecosystems stretch out beneath me. It was surprisingly soothing for a video game that is still mostly about the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzXeL8"&gt;There’s a surprising amount of death in Horizon Zero Dawn, not just NPCs but friends, allies and family, and a deeper mournfulness as you piece through the wreckage of human society. Piece by piece, it sketches out an immediate future for humanity that’s heartbreakingly plausible — full of failed plans and self-inflicted loss — but there’s something beyond it that keeps drawing me back. The game is what happens after the collapse, a reminder that we can emerge from our bunkers to a world that’s still worthwhile. —Russell Brandom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nnp2pU"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kjMBOh"&gt;This feels sort of clichéd, but back when all the lockdown stuff started in March, I went and spent a week rewatching the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; movies. I get that they might not be everyone’s sort of peaceful, relaxing comfort food cinema, but I just sort of gravitated toward the idea of a group of people banding together when times seemed darkest to push back and bring some light back to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRX2gY"&gt;It’s been a few months since I marathoned those movies, and if anything, things have only gotten more chaotic in the world. But I think I might go and escape back to Middle Earth soon — because even though it’s a fantastical world where good always triumphs and the bonds of friendship and fellowship can overcome any obstacle, as Neil Gaiman once wrote: “Fairy tales are more than true — not because they tell us dragons exist, but because they tell us dragons can be beaten.” It’s the sort of sentiment that I’d like to take into 2021. —Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q6zh8Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6C8SX0mWP0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l6pWXw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Folklore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="k948lr"&gt;I barely recognized Taylor Swift the first time I listened to &lt;em&gt;Reputation. &lt;/em&gt;She was a different character from the one who’d sung some of my favorite songs in the past. She was defensive, detached, the music was produced and bombastic — she was performing sharp resilience in the face of adversity. “All the liars are calling me one/Nobody’s heard from me for months/I’m doing better than I ever was.” &lt;em&gt;I don’t care what’s happening, &lt;/em&gt;she shouted at us&lt;em&gt;. Look how okay I am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4v7FVu"&gt;It’s a fair enough message. And there have been years of my life when I needed &lt;em&gt;Reputation. &lt;/em&gt;Once when I was cheated on, I listened to “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” and, incensed, thought “Your loss, dude.” When I was embroiled in Twitter drama and Facebook doomthreads, “Look What You Made Me Do”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;rang through my head. “You’ll all get yours,” I would grin to myself, alongside her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUBiv8"&gt;But this wasn’t a year I needed &lt;em&gt;Reputation. &lt;/em&gt;Despite the fact that there are plenty of loving people in my life, much of my year was isolation, scrolling through social media and reading terrible news after terrible news. I have struggled. And I have struggled with the struggling — I have wondered whether I’m selfish and unreasonable to struggle, when the people on Instagram seem to be doing just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Craoh"&gt;This was a year I needed &lt;em&gt;Folklore. &lt;/em&gt;I needed music that placed heartbreak and anguish on an open table — music that mourned, and didn’t try to hide that it was mourning. I needed an album that captured the raw truth of being a person who lives. I needed to hear “At least I’m trying” over and over again. I needed an album to tell me “Other people feel this way, too.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eif3bm"&gt;This year, I needed to hear that other people feel — that feeling bad because bad things are happening isn’t a sign of weakness. Or maybe it is a sign of weakness, but that doesn’t matter. &lt;em&gt;Folklore&lt;/em&gt;, it is. —Monica Chin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xgkZBC"&gt;Inspiring quotes from video game characters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ecRygM"&gt;My wife and I have spent hours in video game worlds during the pandemic, which means that we’ve heard a lot of virtual characters say the same one-liners over and over again. Sure, some were grating by the thousandth time we heard them. But there were a few that were so delightfully cheesy or endearingly catchy that we’ve started using them to help us get through the real difficulties of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQY7lN"&gt;“It was never in doubt,” often said by Cloud Strife in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; after a victorious battle, was a common phrase of encouragement when we accomplished something good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcYA5q"&gt;“Let’s do it,” said with smooth confidence by Joker in &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/em&gt;, helped us step out the door early in the morning for long weekend runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAgBBw"&gt;“Stand and fight me!” one of Jin Sakai’s battle cries in &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;, was used as a battle cry of our own before we approached opposing squads in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SI_W6c-mSJecYj2XLUJc0A1hJdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19445971/gallery_full_screen_24.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a2zml9"&gt;These quips have been a bright spot of humor and actual inspiration during this very stressful year. And even when the pandemic is over and we aren’t playing as many video games, the quotes are now just part of our shared lexicon, and I know we’ll be saying them to each other for a long time to come. It was never in doubt. —Jay Peters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IdvAxE"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Brave Faces Everyone &lt;/em&gt;by Spanish Love Songs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XPVaXu"&gt;2020 has certainly seemed to be the year for comfort food, both literally and in terms of entertainment: A lot of us have been playing familiar songs, shows, and movies on repeat to make us feel better. It’s a bit strange, then, that the piece of media that got me through the year was a new album from a band I’d never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20O8r4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://spanishlovesongs.bandcamp.com/album/brave-faces-everyone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brave Faces Everyone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was released in February before the coronavirus really became &lt;em&gt;a thing&lt;/em&gt;, but it manages to touch on almost every other social issue that’s been buzzing around my head, keeping me up at night or making me pace around my house the second I run out of things to do. Which seems contradictory; why would I want to think about these things &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;? I can’t quite put my finger on it, but by the time the final song plays, re-incorporating phrases from the previous songs, I can’t help but feel better. Maybe it’s that the writing seems sincere and unpretentious, or maybe it’s just knowing that someone else is going through the same things and has given me words to yell along to that put things much clearer than I could’ve. —Mitchell Clark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j2XN43"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Oh my god... I never thought this would happen!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Z5wPrE"&gt;An ode to all the TV that got me through this year, in the form of an award show acceptance speech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GEbDTM"&gt;Oh my god... I never thought this would happen! Oh my. My heart’s beating so fast. I have to thank Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video — oh, I’m sure there’s people I’m forgetting to mention. I should have written something down but I didn’t think this could ever happen to me. It’s a little ridiculous, isn’t it? [&lt;em&gt;audience laughter&lt;/em&gt;] Wow. There are so many shows that have gotten me through this pandemic, I’m just going to start listing them all before they kick me off this stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8g6OT5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What We Do in the Shadows &lt;/em&gt;is an absurdly smart but dumb comedy from Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi that I cherish so much. It’s the thing that got me through the saddest parts of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a6jxK"&gt;Multiple &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl &lt;/em&gt;reruns are what I threw on when I was bored and couldn’t leave the apartment. Thank you, Dan, Serena, Jenny, Blair, Nate, and Chuck for people so fun to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inmH02"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;reminded me what hope and excitement feels like, and I’ve never fallen in love with someone as quickly as I did Baby Yoda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQZJEu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euphoria, &lt;/em&gt;which let me feel bad without judgment when I needed to feel bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66RKEb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventure Time, &lt;/em&gt;which picked me up when sitting in my own bad feelings became too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcojJ7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[orchestral music starts to play]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6EU3p"&gt;Oh, oh, okay, they’re telling me to wrap up. God. I’ll just list quickly some of the others, but it’s impossible to get to you all. Thank you so, so much to &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty, Criminal Minds, Good News, 30 Rock, Arrested Development, Harry Potter, Hannibal, Lucifer, Big Mouth, Schitt’s Creek, &lt;/em&gt;the Marvel movies&lt;em&gt;, Star Wars, New Girl, &lt;/em&gt;John Mulaney, &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Regular Show, &lt;/em&gt;and everything in between! Some of you are old friends that became new again, and some are new friends I’ve come to love. —Julia Alexander&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Td05Fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magnus Archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="v0u9th"&gt;Leave it to me to rely on an apocalyptic horror podcast to get through what has felt like an actual apocalypse. &lt;em&gt;The Magnus Archives&lt;/em&gt;, produced by Rusty Quill, is chock-full of terrible things: flesh-eating worms, doors leading to endless twisting hallways, and the fear that wherever you hide, someone is watching. In a truly incredible instance of bad timing, the fifth and final season was planned to start releasing right at the beginning of worldwide lockdowns. The producers had to put a warning at the top of the first episode of the season saying it deals with themes of “isolation, contagion, and armageddon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vCLl5h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Leave it to me to rely on an apocalyptic horror podcast &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0JjMVG"&gt;And readers, let me tell you, I plowed through that warning and welcomed Armageddon with open arms. There’s something strangely comforting about listening to characters struggle through the end of the world while you too are trying to survive an &lt;em&gt;extremely rough time&lt;/em&gt; in the real world. But beyond that, there are also small moments amid all the cosmic horror where characters laugh at each other’s bad jokes. And there’s gay love! Mid-apocalypse gay love! Right now, listening to &lt;em&gt;The Magnus Archives&lt;/em&gt; feels good. And by good, I mean it feels bad in a simultaneously abstract and relatable way, which apparently is just what I need. —Kait Sanchez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UzGsXb"&gt;’90s television&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qr7bwp"&gt;In many ways, rewatching shows from my youth has been a comfort. I’ve been laughing at the terrible puns in &lt;em&gt;Frasier &lt;/em&gt;all over again, and watching intently as young relationships develop in &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt;. The theme songs trigger a sort of Pavlovian response forcing me to watch through the opening credits and not hit the “skip” button. I’ve particularly enjoyed how silly these shows can be: my favorite episode of &lt;em&gt;Buffy&lt;/em&gt; involves a demonic chatbot and introduced me to the term “technopagan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJ6ZPw"&gt;But it’s also been a bit disturbing. There are plenty of things I didn’t pick up on when I first watched these shows, and in retrospect some of them don’t hold up in 2020. Why is a century-old vampire dating a teenager? Why doesn’t anyone stop Niles from being such a creep? And don’t get me started on Frasier’s impossibly large, labyrinth-like apartment. It’s like something out of &lt;em&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/em&gt;. I initially watched these shows as a way to escape and turn off my brain. But examining them again as an adult turned out to be much more interesting. —Andrew Webster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zCbqH8"&gt;Theater at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FrQD2D"&gt;In the beginning of the pandemic, when New York City was considered the epicenter and we were frantically trying to sterilize anything that came through the door, there were a lot of theater companies and other entertainers who were offering free online (or on-cable) performances from their repertoire. One of those was the UK’s National Theatre, which offered a series called &lt;em&gt;National Theatre at Home&lt;/em&gt;, where it would put up a different one of its filmed productions every few days. We checked it every day to see what was coming, watched several, and were absolutely mesmerized by a wonderful and innovative stage performance of &lt;a href="https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/nt-at-home-jane-eyre"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that ran in April. It was these, and other wonderfully revolutionary productions put on by a bunch of theater companies, that kept us going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68Uy77"&gt;That, and an array of science fiction, detective, documentary, and other series. The most recent has been &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt;, which has a wonderful script, fantastic actors, and a fascinating storyline (and was based on a great novel by Walter Tevis, which I immediately read as soon as the series was over). And, of course, the comfort food show to top all others, &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show&lt;/em&gt; — but that almost goes without saying, doesn’t it? —Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAjJZT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The webcam is the gadget of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H4ehReXUWTK6V0pwnikBCL8RnBI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68509099/VRG_ILLO_4334_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From grainy MacBooks to elaborate DSLR setups, no gadget had a bigger impact on how we got through 2020&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lHoBWY"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; selects its annual Person of the Year, it’s not necessarily an endorsement of the recipient’s actions or beliefs. Instead, it’s more of an acknowledgement of the person’s outsized impact on the world in that calendar year. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t normally give out a “gadget of the year” award, but it’s pretty obvious what 2020’s would be if we went by Time’s criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OQga7"&gt;It’s the webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bqg3QS"&gt;Yes, the humble webcam, which was only mentioned twice in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/20997215/best-gadgets-decade-2010s-list-roundup-apple-iphone-tesla-amazon-samsung"&gt;Gadgets of the Decade list a year ago&lt;/a&gt;: once to dunk on the bad one on the Dell XPS 15 laptop, and again to note the rise of the little plastic covers that stop them working altogether. But 2020 was a year in which bedrooms turned into boardrooms, with millions of people learning to work from home for the first time. And it turns out there’s nothing like a pandemic to throw the limits of technology into sharp relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szJany"&gt;What people learned about webcams this year is that by and large, they suck. It’s hard enough to adapt to online meetings and compensate for the lack of in-person interaction without having to peer at a tiny video feed that makes your phone’s selfie camera look like a DSLR. There are things you can do to limit the blown-out exposure, but it only goes so far — built-in laptop webcams are pretty universally bad. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fLvoJ0YoDVH0oERKfXmAsMU3doU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168534/bad_webcam.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “clearer, sharper” MacBook Air webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CTDwjm"&gt;Take the new MacBook Air, for example, which we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;came very close to scoring 10/10&lt;/a&gt; but decided against largely because it still has a terrible 720p webcam. Apple used some software processing tricks to improve the image quality slightly, claiming you’ll get “clearer, sharper images” with “more detail in shadows and highlights,” but the hardware is just too limited for the results to make much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPrQQ8"&gt;Why don’t webcams have better hardware, then? Well, particularly with laptops, it’s complicated. Laptops have such thin lids that it’s hard to fit in anything other than the smallest image sensors, which has a direct impact on the image quality. The 720p resolution isn’t really the issue — you can watch a 720p Blu-ray movie and it’ll look great on a laptop-sized screen. It’s the small physical size of the sensor that causes the lack of dynamic range and general light-gathering capability. And increasing the surface area of the sensor would generally also require increasing the overall depth of the camera module in order to include a lens with the right field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyeWgI"&gt;That’s why tablet computers like the iPad tend to have much better webcams than laptops (although in the iPad Pro’s case, the camera is located at a very unflattering angle). There’s more space to fit larger camera modules because the tablet chassis has to be thick enough to accommodate the entire computer as well; the keyboard attachments are basically just a keyboard. Laptops are the other way around, with a much thinner lid for the screen while the main computer components and battery are housed in the bottom half. (It’s worth noting that Apple did also manage to give the iMac a webcam upgrade this year that we described as “no longer vaguely embarrassing.”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJ0lwc4wOWn3XGyIBOtqQkDFDG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168535/DSC01539.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 iMac, which did actually have a better webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kVOJYF"&gt;I’m not saying that there is no possible way for laptops to get better webcams. Everything is a tradeoff, and maybe some laptop manufacturers will soon decide to make a different one in order to improve image quality. Perhaps there will be laptops with conspicuous camera bumps in our lives next year. Until that happens, though, people have had to find alternative solutions to looking better on video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtoWlD"&gt;The first sign something was up was the March-April run on external webcams, where they became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21199521/webcam-shortage-price-raise-logitech-razer-amazon-best-buy-ebay"&gt;impossible to find&lt;/a&gt; online without jacked-up prices at a time when most brick-and-mortar retailers were closed. Logitech told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it was ramping up production to meet demand and reporting gray market resellers who’d been selling products on for profit. The situation settled down as the year went on, and it’s easier to get hold of one today, but my guess is you might see a bunch more videoconferencing products announced at CES next month than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AMWQJ1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"All the ways to turn your phone or camera into a webcam","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21523161/phone-camera-webcam-how-to-iphone-android-dslr"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dLUOth"&gt;Even dedicated webcams aren’t necessarily known for stunning image quality, though. They’re a big step up from a laptop’s built-in camera, but they’re still webcams. That’s why it was gratifying to see dedicated camera companies jump at the opportunity to enable a whole new use case for their DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. Sony, Fujifilm, Canon, Olympus, Panasonic, and Nikon all released apps that could turn their cameras into webcams, bringing tack-sharp focus and creamy bokeh to the world of Zoom meetings to the first time and sparking an arms race among tech reporters to achieve the most cinematic video stream. Before that, there’d been a spike in demand for HDMI capture cards, which allow you to jury-rig your own camera setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M28y71"&gt;Webcams have been around forever, but for many people unexpectedly thrown into the reality of working from home, it took the events of 2020 to highlight how inadequate and inert their recent development has been. I think you’ll see companies invest more in this space in the near future, as COVID-19 has undoubtedly altered work dynamics forever. But when people look back to 2020 and how they spent their days in lockdown, they’re going to think about how they connected with others. A lot of the time, they’ll be thinking about a grainy image captured on a terrible webcam. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Demon’s Souls is my game of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqcAXvuckp7tVKqt9R7qOKbDDMg=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508948/demons_souls_screenshot_17_disclaimer_en_09nov20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I4ERdY"&gt;I nearly gave up on &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZAK6x"&gt;I should have known what I was getting into. I bought the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remake for the PlayStation 5 as my opportunity to finally play a “Soulsborne” game. After hearing about the genre for more than a decade, I knew that the game would be extremely hard, that I’d die multiple times, and that the challenge was all part of the process of learning about and enjoying the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pgHvc"&gt;But I wasn’t too worried — I like hard games. I loved the early hours of &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Beating Celeste’s grueling DLC chapter was a thrill. I figured that since I had gotten through those, and because I knew &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; would be a challenge going in, I would be able to stick with it no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xIuuLc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My resolve was tested immediately&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oxafSG"&gt;That resolve was tested immediately. I died about a dozen times in the first level by brazenly swinging my sword as a knight. Following a fit of frustrated Googling, I switched to the royalty class so that I could use a long-range magic spell that made taking on enemies easier. While that helped, I was still in over my head and dying repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4yNJY"&gt;An early level, the Prison of Hope, nearly broke me with its punishingly narrow pathways inhabited by magic-slinging tentacle-headed monsters. After yet another death (I believe it was the one where I fell down a hole after 30 minutes of barely surviving the level’s harrowing halls), I put the game down and considered the $70 I paid for it a sunk cost. I was ready to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWb2P1cR3f_narAM0Lb05KzaJE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141828/demons_souls_screenshot_11_disclaimer_en_28oct20.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These tentacle-headed monsters haunted me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBR1R6"&gt;But two days later, I allowed myself just one more attempt at the game. Instead of yet another hellish trip through the Prison of Hope, though, I went to the fourth world, hoping that a change of scenery might do me some good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyQWrF"&gt;Right away, I was faced with a new monstrosity: a blue-eyed skeleton wielding a giant sword that began rapidly somersaulting toward me. I thought it was all over. But using the skills I had learned taking on the tentacle-headed beasts in the Prison of Hope, I pulled off a few well-timed dodges and blasts of magic, and before I knew it, the skeleton was defeated. And then I took down the next one, and the next one, and the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Uw0sI"&gt;It was that moment that turned &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; around for me. Looking back on it, I realized that the game had been constantly teaching me how to get better, even if I didn’t know it, and that I could use the skills I was subconsciously learning to play better. The challenge was indeed part of the process. From then on, I was completely obsessed with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qGBH2P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rest of the game wasn’t easy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T7JH2K"&gt;That’s not to say the rest of the game was easy. At one point, that first skeleton was joined by a menacingly red demon that could defeat me in one stroke of its sword. One difficult boss stymied me when an exact clone joined the fight partway through. A later swamp-themed level was so filled with danger that I had to inch my way through, fearing that any crucial mistake could cost me nearly an hour of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRFIa7"&gt;But thanks to that first lesson with the skeletons, I learned that every challenge in &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, no matter how hard it might seem, could eventually be overcome. I kept at it. And as sappy as it sounds, it’s kind of a beautiful lesson for real life, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwodQa"&gt;I plan to try later games like &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, but for now, I can revel in my victory of having seen the credits roll in &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;. I’m glad I didn’t give up because I got to experience my favorite game of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pornhub just removed most of its videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTP5kgyAJCfHIbM6sF1zqxgx6Sc=/0x134:740x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508942/pornhub-billboard-1-sq.0.0.1438872408.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Pornhub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwonH2"&gt;Pornhub is removing all videos uploaded to its site by unverified users, millions of videos in total, as part of a crackdown on user-uploaded content after two major payment processors suspended service. The decision, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqjjy/pornhub-suspended-all-unverified-videos-content"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stems from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that found the site was hosting videos of people who are underage and videos showing children being assaulted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47jS6O"&gt;The site announced last Tuesday that it would begin limiting uploads to verified users only. Uploads now have to come from official content partners or members of Pornhub’s “Model Program,” which requires age verification to sign up. &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reports that all previously uploaded videos are now being pulled “pending verification and review” beginning in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uqYD3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 8 million videos have been wiped out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jvgXMK"&gt;“This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders, a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute,” Pornhub wrote in a blog post this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lLcGf"&gt;Pornhub appears to have wiped out more than 8.8 million videos as of this writing. &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;said the site boasted 13.5 million videos on Sunday night; it has 4.7 million as of Monday morning. While the site hosts professional videos, its main function operates much like YouTube — allowing users to upload videos of their own and make money off of ad revenue. These videos represented the bulk of Pornhub’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm5XGJ"&gt;Following the &lt;em&gt;Times’ &lt;/em&gt;report last week, Visa and Mastercard said they would investigate whether the site was hosting illegal content. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168240/mastercard-ending-pornhub-payment-processing-unlawful-videos"&gt;both companies cut off service&lt;/a&gt;, preventing customers from making purchases on Pornhub through two of the most popular payment methods available. The suspension of service could pose a significant problem for Pornhub, which also sells videos, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v33d/sex-workers-what-visa-and-mastercard-dropping-pornhub-means-to-performers"&gt;and for the sex workers&lt;/a&gt; who use the platform’s sales as a source of income.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail, YouTube, Google Docs, and other Google services hit by massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbj8WSnkG8sqkNpzVL0S3fMGoS8=/82x0:1405x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508540/image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of Google’s most popular services were hit by the outage.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DownDetector&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F5AJ7l"&gt;Multiple Google services and websites including YouTube, Gmail, Google Assistant, and Google Docs were down for around an hour on Monday morning after being hit with a widespread outage. Google &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;iid=52f0b876cce03b08d13dc753c55fc3b2"&gt;acknowledged the issues&lt;/a&gt; with Gmail, affecting both its business and personal services, at 6:55AM ET, and said the problem was fixed for the “vast majority” of users at 7:52AM ET. Identical notices were posted across the status pages for the rest of Google’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2E3uP"&gt;Reports quickly mounted on Twitter after users couldn’t access Google’s basic services, causing the hashtag “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23YouTubeDOWN&amp;amp;src=trend_click&amp;amp;vertical=trends"&gt;#YouTubeDOWN&lt;/a&gt;” to trend. At its peak, the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;status page for Google’s services&lt;/a&gt; was a sea of red, to indicate they were all suffering an outage. All services are now green indicating that they’re fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of Google’s services reported an outage at one point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KJrdkG"&gt;The world’s dependence on Google services led to a truly staggering number of reports on DownDetector, with the number of reported YouTube problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/youtube/"&gt;peaking at over 100,000&lt;/a&gt;. Some users found YouTube was still functional if they visited it in an incognito browser without signing in. Google Workspace apps like Docs and Meet were also down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOzewl"&gt;Users also reported that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joemfbrown/status/1338452107419148290?s=19"&gt;smart home gadgets&lt;/a&gt; integrated with Google Assistant were experiencing issues. We verified that a Nest Hub smart display was unable to control a connected smart heater, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQK1Uv"&gt;Third-party apps and services that rely on Google’s back end services, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/pokemon-go/"&gt;like Pokémon Go&lt;/a&gt;, were also hit by problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJKFW"&gt;However, despite the outage affecting numerous Google services, its core search product continued to function, and third-party ads were still showing in results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbgzbm"&gt;The outage was worldwide. We verified that services experienced issues in the US, UK, Netherlands, and Japan, and DownDetector’s outage reports spanned the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is releasing Bitmoji Paint, a massively multiplayer online painting game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshots of Snapchat’s Bitmoji Paint game showing Bitmoji characters standing on grids of pixel art." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p31hr0M0P_vtC8rI_ELIC3U-rP8=/5x0:1253x832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508641/Bitmoji_Paint_Press_Asset.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u33c7Z"&gt;Today, Snapchat is getting a new original game called &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt;. As the name suggests, the game involves Bitmoji — those cutely grotesque customizable avatars — and painting. It’s Snap Inc.’s second title from its internal games studio, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525168/snapchat-games-bitmoji-party-developers"&gt;which began putting out games last year&lt;/a&gt;. “Our goal with Bitmoji has always been to be the world’s avatar, to give people a digital version of themselves that represents them and lets them be themselves online,” says Ba Blackstock, co-founder of Bitmoji. “And so now with games, it’s also letting people play together in a really new and fun and exciting way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JSBfr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt; places players on a gigantic, pixelated grid, and lets them paint those squares as a shared canvas. Zoom out, and you get pixel art. You get there by pressing the rocket icon or through search; the first thing you’ll see are floating islands in space, which are different servers you can join with hundreds of other players. There are three modes — move, paint, and map — and users can also interact with other players around the world using stock emotes. There’s also a voice chat function in Snap’s game menu so you can talk to your friends while you’re scribbling. Creations persist, so you can keep working on the things you’ve started. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1oMnkBjHB3WfPk6PscYav_42WzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22163607/BP_3.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NeaAqC"&gt;“A lot of the playability in the game is things like simple scribbles,” says John Imah, head of games and entertainment partnerships at Snap. “You can send fun messages, and also even [make] giant landscapes, all these things are all possible in &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt;.” He’s been playing the game for a while now and says he’s excited for the world to see it, and then to see how people have fun with it.  (As far as moderation goes, players can’t see each other’s Snap IDs unless they’re already friends, and the company emphasized that it’ll provide easy access to reporting tools.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGYCdg"&gt;Snap has used games and unique filters to pull people into its app and stand apart from competitors like TikTok and Instagram. Its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525427/snapchat-earnings-q3-2020-anime-lens-3-billion-uses"&gt;anime lens&lt;/a&gt; went viral outside the app and was used 3 billion times in its first week. That said, to hear Imah tell it, the games program has already been a big success. “To date, we’ve had more than 100 million Snapchatters play our games, which we’re incredibly proud of,” he says. “An average of 20 minutes are played per player every day, when they’re playing &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Party&lt;/em&gt;,” Imah says. Sounds like &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji Paint&lt;/em&gt; has some large shoes to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OilIsY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6um0I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit buys TikTok rival Dubsmash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7FOlbedTN-blbYC1_wl6jBAbGA=/165x0:1035x580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508430/rd_banner.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7zSyt"&gt;Reddit has acquired “short-form video social platform” Dubsmash, &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/12/13/reddit-welcomes-video-platform-dubsmash-to-team/"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Under the terms of the deal, the TikTok rival will continue to exist as a separate platform and brand, but its “innovative video creation tools” will be integrated into Reddit. Although Reddit has supported native video uploads since 2017, its video-editing tools are limited, and much of the video content posted on the platform is hosted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb2ORF"&gt;In a post announcing the acquisition, Reddit said it is looking forward “to bringing our teams together to combine the unique creator experience of Dubsmash with the community growth engine of Reddit.” The sum paid for the New York-based company was not disclosed as part of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z8mP86"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Dubsmash provides a welcoming platform for creators and users who are under-represented in social media”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcwInx"&gt;According to data from App Annie &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/dubsmash-songs/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Dubsmash’s share of the USA’s short-form video market is second only to TikTok. Although its co-founder and president, Suchit Dash, declined to share the service’s total number of users in an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-snaps-up-dubsmash-to-expand-in-fast-growing-video-app-market-11607912841"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its videos are reportedly viewed over a billion times per month, and 30 percent of its users log on daily to create videos. Reddit, meanwhile, recently disclosed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754984/reddit-dau-daily-users-revealed"&gt;52 million users are active on its platform daily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkpSu2"&gt;Reddit specifically cites Dubsmash’s diverse user base as one of the reasons for its acquisition. According to Reddit around 25 percent of Black teenagers in the US use the service, and that 70 percent of its users are female. “Dubsmash provides a welcoming platform for creators and users who are under-represented in social media,” Reddit’s announcement notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qst2cg"&gt;Earlier this year, Reddit said it would be &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/"&gt;making efforts to address hate speech on its platform&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279601/reddit-dark-subreddits-protest-police-violence-racism-hate-speech-policies"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281744/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-resigns-board"&gt;resignation of one of its co-founders&lt;/a&gt;. When Alexis Ohanian resigned, he asked for his position to be filled by a Black candidate. He was subsequently replaced by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21285835/reddit-board-replacement-alexis-ohanian-michael-seibel-y-combinator"&gt;Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 developer says disappointed players can ask for refunds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtnyczyWiaHEgCJU3wAyj0sGKLc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508170/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjGfur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red has acknowledged the performance issues plaguing the game on base last-gen consoles, and has apologized for not showing the game running on the original PS4 and Xbox One prior to its release. “We should have paid more attention to making it play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” it said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;notice published on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The developer said it is hoping to fix the “most prominent problems” with a series of patches to be released over the coming months, but added that anyone who doesn’t want to wait will be able to return their copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJHWYf"&gt;The statement follows numerous posts about how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;poorly the game runs on the older machines&lt;/a&gt;. Players have reported choppy frame rates, weird physics, texture pop-in, and screen tearing. Its performance has quickly become an online meme, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22166912/cyberpunk-2077-base-ps4-xbox-one-bugs-issues-glitches-performance-trees-bushes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;reports, &lt;/a&gt;and videos and screenshots of the issues have been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Legolas/status/1336768342993104899"&gt;going viral on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WWrZsO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/jtF5WKCiro"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jtF5WKCiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2yXLrL"&gt;CD Projekt Red gave the PC version of the game to most reviewers, and seemingly did not provide console versions of the game, meaning these performance issues have only received widespread attention after the game’s release. In an investor call last month, CD Projekt Red joint-CEO Adam Kaciński even said the game runs “&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4391610-cd-projekt-s-otglf-ceo-adam-kicinski-on-q3-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;surprisingly well&lt;/a&gt;” on last-gen’s base hardware. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;reviewed the game on PC&lt;/a&gt;, and although we found it was buggy, we didn’t see any of the more serious issues that players are reporting on the base PS4 and Xbox One. CD Projekt Red apologized for not showing the game on base last-gen consoles before its release “and, in consequence, not allowing you to make a more informed decision about your purchase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwRQID"&gt;The developer promises that a host of fixes are coming to fix the performance problems, starting with another round of updates that’ll be released in the next seven days. In January and February, CD Projekt Red plans on releasing a pair of large patches that it says “should fix the most prominent problems gamers are facing on last-gen consoles.” However it cautions that “they won’t make the game on last-gen look like it’s running on a high-spec PC or next-gen console, but it will be closer to that experience than it is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYLice"&gt;It says the PC version of the game will also be receiving regular updates and fixes. There’s also an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1273963818113216513"&gt;upgraded next-gen console version of the game&lt;/a&gt; on the way, though there’s no word on when exactly that’s arriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmugAL"&gt;Although fixes are on the way, the developer says that players are free to request refunds if they don’t want to wait. Digital purchases can be returned via Sony and Microsoft’s respective refund systems (&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-players-are-seemingly-getting-refunds-after-complaining-about-performance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; many buyers have already reported successfully claiming refunds via these methods, which isn’t usually possible in cases like this), and it says players should attempt to return boxed versions of the game to wherever they bought it. It has set up a dedicated email address for players to contact over the next week if they have trouble returning their copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJecUl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is buying Codemasters for $1.2 billion to take lead in racing game market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_XFbajObSeg7gAjJsZeLI0ltLjA=/150x0:1850x1133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68508136/XlPL0pXmRyiUcwac_SxURA.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBQXPk"&gt;Electronic Arts has agreed to buy out UK developer Codemasters in a move that could see the US publishing giant wrest control of the racing video game genre. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year for £6.04 (~$7.98) a share, valuing Codemasters at around $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNZFJ6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/games-giant-electronic-arts-gatecrashes-725m-codemasters-takeover-12160582?awc=11005_1607932504_f635c04741f6c3ae9f7e6abbb5b5e4b8&amp;amp;dcmp=afc-103504-na-na-longtail&amp;amp;dclid=CIrGyq7_zO0CFQwEvAodKHoGoQ"&gt;Sky News first reported&lt;/a&gt; EA’s interest in Codemasters over the weekend, saying that the British company had previously agreed a $970 million deal with Rockstar Games and 2K Sports owner Take-Two Interactive. EA &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201213005036/en/Electronic-Arts-Reaches-Agreement-for-Recommended-Acquisition-of-Codemasters-Group-Holdings-PLC"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the agreement early Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvXU3g"&gt;Codemasters is one of the oldest British game developers, having been founded in the ‘80s and producing early hits like &lt;em&gt;Dizzy &lt;/em&gt;for systems that were popular in the UK like the ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64. In recent decades it’s been best known for creating racing games like the &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grid&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Formula 1&lt;/em&gt; series, and last year acquired the developer behind &lt;em&gt;Project Cars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ezZtca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dirt 5 reminded me how much I needed MotorStorm back in my life","url":"https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/17/21571850/dirt-5-motorstorm-impressions-tracks-courses"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vu70I7"&gt;EA, of course, owns the &lt;em&gt;Need for Speed&lt;/em&gt; franchise, so the Codemasters addition would give it further control over a huge chunk of the racing game market. The main competitors would be Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; and Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; series, both of which are exclusive to their publishers’ respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KPtNM"&gt;“We believe there is a deeply compelling opportunity in bringing together Codemasters and Electronic Arts to create amazing and innovative new racing games for fans,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson says in a statement. “Our industry is growing, the racing category is growing, and together we will be positioned to lead in a new era of racing entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePYZV3"&gt;“Electronic Arts and Codemasters have a shared ambition to lead the video game racing category,” says Codemasters chairman Gerhard Florin. “The Board of Codemasters firmly believes the company would benefit from EA’s knowledge, resources and extensive global scale — both overall and specifically within the racing sector. We feel this union would provide an exciting and prosperous future for Codemasters, allowing our teams to create, launch and service bigger and better games to an extremely passionate audience.” &lt;/p&gt;
