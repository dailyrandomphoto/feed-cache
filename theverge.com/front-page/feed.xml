    <title>Some research has gotten a huge boost during the pandemic</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CoxvEf"&gt;Billions of dollars have been spent fighting the pandemic, with a &lt;a href="https://time.com/5921360/operation-warp-speed-vaccine-spending/"&gt;huge proportion&lt;/a&gt; of that money going towards vaccine development. Other areas of research have also gotten a big boost during the pandemic — and the results could make a huge difference to public health in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n054W9"&gt;Here are some of the big winners in the pandemic-inspired funding race.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca2yNz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mRNA Vaccines — &lt;/strong&gt;The astounding success of both the Pfizer / BioNtech and Moderna vaccines has set the stage for the development of other highly-customizable vaccines in the future. The beauty of the vaccines is that they are basically blueprints — they use a genetic code to tell the body to build tiny molecular targets. The body’s immune system then goes to town on target practice and builds up immunity so that if a real threat — like the coronavirus — shows up, it can quickly respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PBCVyy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXws8z"&gt;Researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-billion-dollar-covid-vaccines-basic-government-funded-science-laid-the-groundwork/"&gt;working on the basic science&lt;/a&gt; around mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/business/start-ups/mRNA-disrupt-drug-industry/96/i35"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, but haven’t been able to get a truly big break until now. They were getting funding, but remained in the shadow of the “&lt;a href="http://geroscience.com/biotech-valley-of-death/"&gt;biotech valley of death&lt;/a&gt;” — the gap between a research discovery and commercialization. Now that they’ve proven themselves in clinical trials, and been used to vaccinate millions of people — suddenly they are poised for a massive boom. With production ramping up, researchers see hope for diseases including &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/05/1017366/messenger-rna-vaccines-covid-hiv/"&gt;HIV and sickle-cell anemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBZ9Db"&gt;Their success is a big win for drug companies (&lt;a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/trends-news/covid-19-vaccine-biontech-pfizer/"&gt;and the stock market&lt;/a&gt;) but also for researchers and smaller suppliers. Specialty biotech companies that produce the nanoparticles which hold the vaccines’ genetic material have been booming, with some &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/business/outsourcing/Lipids-unsung-COVID-19-vaccine/99/web/2021/02"&gt;increasing their production 50-fold&lt;/a&gt;. The authorizations, great clinical trial results, and investments in this kind of manufacturing might mean that we see more mRNA vaccines in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FTVX2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid molecular testing — &lt;/strong&gt;Before COVID-19 a handful of companies were working on diagnostic tests for flu, sexually transmitted diseases, a boatload of other ailments. These quick, easy tests could look for the genetic material of a virus in patient samples without needing a slow trip to the lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbKayo"&gt;When these companies started seeing the reports of this new virus, many of them pivoted. Their tests could detect viruses — why not train them to detect &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;virus? Suddenly, they went from being an academic exercise (also languishing in the valley of death) to investors pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into their technology. These rapid tests could make it easier to diagnose diseases in the future. For more on the boom in rapid molecular testing, read my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323268/covid-rapid-testing-pandemic-home-disease-pcr"&gt;Nicole Wetsman’s excellent story from this week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yo8Ri"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long COVID — &lt;/strong&gt;This one’s a little different from the others, but it’s also a notable new area of research that’s emerged during the pandemic. A few weeks ago, the National Institutes of Health announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-launches-new-initiative-study-long-covid"&gt;$1.15 billion commitment&lt;/a&gt; to research “long COVID.” Some people who get infected with the virus end up having symptoms that persist for months — and researchers still don’t know why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajz4Zf"&gt;The four-year initiative will help drive research into why this happens, who is affected, and what the long-lasting effects are, among other questions. It’s a big boost for people who suffer from long COVID and other diseases with extended recovery times — whether they’re viral or not. These kinds of symptoms are often overlooked, but, as Julia Belluz &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22298751/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-hauler-symptoms"&gt;points out at &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;they definitely aren’t unique to COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oduZZ"&gt;All of this money allowed scientists to start grappling with a new, emerging threat. The millions, and in some cases, billions of dollars have allowed new technologies to prove themselves. These are investments that have the potential to change how we look at older diseases that have been with us for ages, in addition to newer, emerging threats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYrtcN"&gt;The question now is how we move that urgency and funding into medicine more broadly, after this particular pandemic has passed us by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkcnBi"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y8RUUO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HUfqO7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/health/vaccine-side-effects-women-men.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women report worse side effects after a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with many other vaccines, women tend to respond differently to COVID-19 shots, often reporting worse side effects than men. (Melinda Wenner Moyer / &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nllD5G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/04/unlocking-the-mysteries-of-long-covid/618076/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking the mysteries of long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take a deep look into some of the existing research into long COVID in this extensive feature from &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic.&lt;/em&gt; (Meghan O’Rourke / &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dxn87J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320344/dr-b-covid-vaccine-standby-list-coronavirus-immunization-overflow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Dr. B, the startup promising a better way to distribute leftover vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Efforts to connect people to leftover vaccines in the US have started to coalesce around a startup called Dr. B. Here’s how it works. (Russell Brandom / &lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9njtoN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56357760"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxford-AstraZeneca: EU says ‘no indication’ vaccine linked to clots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A number of countries suspended use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines over fears that it might be linked to blood clots. But soon after, the EU regulator said there was no indication that the shots were linked to clots. (&lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTD7L0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-targeting-multiple-strains-are-in-the-works-11615374007"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID-19 vaccines targeting multiple variants are in the works at Moderna, Novavax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Companies are starting work on vaccines that will target multiple variants of the coronavirus instead of a single variant&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;(Jared Hopkins / &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fS5ry4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E78KUD"&gt;On March 10th, I took a selfie with a woman who had fallen asleep on me during my commute home. I joked that “social distancing in NYC is going great!” The next day, I showed up to the office and only a handful of my colleagues were in, but all of the snacks were gone. I had a few bags of chips stowed away at my desk, and I used chopsticks to eat them because I was afraid of touching my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ubwp7A"&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Verge Science&lt;/em&gt;’s own Cory Zapatka remembers a year ago this week, when the pandemic was officially declared. He and other &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325333/covid-pandemic-one-year-later-march-pandemic"&gt;shared their memories from the start of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qM8Udm"&gt;“They don’t say, ‘Yes, I ended up here because of the coronavirus...But what they tell you about is a chaotic world, of ‘Yes, I’m not doing my activities any more,’ ‘I’m no longer doing my music,’ ‘Going to school is hard in the mornings,’ ‘I am having difficulty waking up,’ ‘I am fed up with the mask.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="llYl9o"&gt;— Dr. Richard Delorme tells the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; about the children he treats at a pediatric hospital in France. There has been a&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/global-rise-childhood-mental-health-pandemic-8392ceff77ac8e1e0f90a32214e7def1"&gt; global rise in mental health issues in children during this pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lsFaWW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AZr4eK"&gt;To the more than 118,910,684 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BCPyO"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,641,844 people who have died worldwide — 532,593 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hISxaz"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXrpMv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 3/13/2021 11:00AM: &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;previous version of this article misstated the global death toll. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than 2,641,844&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; people have died worldwide, not 118,910,684. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will now let third party developers create custom Tiles for Wear OS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoGUz9xcyyxUuI4gyPJm9LR_22w=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960330/Tiles_alpaha_layout2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wear OS Tiles give users a quick-glance option | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/creating-custom-tiles-on-wear-os-by-google-with-jetpack-tiles.html" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIs6bu"&gt;Google says in a &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/creating-custom-tiles-on-wear-os-by-google-with-jetpack-tiles.html"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it will now allow third-party developers to create custom Tiles for Wear OS. It first introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525335/google-wear-os-tiles-widgets-new-feature-announced"&gt;Tiles in 2019,&lt;/a&gt;  widgets that users could glance at and swipe among to get information about weather, calendar notifications, or stats like heart rate. All of the Tiles used to be directly from Google or the device’s manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/75Ts-byERo_AXi4jTL3r8sGxTQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16204391/tilesbetter.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gyl0HI"&gt;Its &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles"&gt;Jetpack Tiles library&lt;/a&gt; for third-party developers is now in alpha. Google notes in the blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="w0l2vs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiles can be designed for many use cases, like tracking the user’s daily activity progress, quick-starting a workout, starting a recently played song, or sending a message to a favorite contact. While apps can be immersive, Tiles are fast-loading and focus on the user’s immediate needs. If the user would like more information, Tiles can be tapped to open a related app on the watch or phone for a deeper experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ4Vj3"&gt;Wear OS has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21518580/youtube-music-apple-watch-app-wear-os-wearable-problems"&gt;in limbo for a while&lt;/a&gt;, with small &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366514/google-wear-os-fall-update-smartwatch-faster-apps-weather-pairing"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; coming here and there, but without a clear path for its future. In the latest blog post, the company says the new custom Tiles “will become available to users later this spring when we roll out the corresponding Wear OS platform update.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia brings its latency-reducing tech Reflex to Overwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrOYPd26kfdpNpDr3IknEjYCCFA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960298/25458587816_f6f5f221a7_o.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SeWhC"&gt;An update to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s Public Test Region (PTR) &lt;a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/ptr"&gt;is bringing Nvida’s latency-reduction tech&lt;/a&gt;, called Reflex, to the popular esports title (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-nvidia-reflex-191142647-211647638.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. The tech aims to help reduce the amount of time between when you click your mouse, and when you see the resulting action on screen, making the game feel more responsive. The fact that it’s coming to &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-reflex-overwatch-rainbow-six-siege%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F13%2F22328366%2Foverwatch-latency-reduction-nvidia-reflex-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;was announced back in January&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s now available to players who can access the PTR, and who have the latest Nvidia drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2PdqH"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;haven’t been able to get your hands on one of Nvidia’s latest graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, there’s still hope that you’ll be able to try Reflex out for yourself in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; — the tech was announced alongside the 30-series graphics cards, but works on cards going back to the GTX 900-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TtTOU"&gt;Nvidia has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Freflex-low-latency-platform%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F13%2F22328366%2Foverwatch-latency-reduction-nvidia-reflex-beta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an incredibly in-depth explainer&lt;/a&gt; on how the tech works, but the very surface-level overview is that the game will work with your GPU to make sure that frames are made “just-in-time” to be shown on your monitor, so you should theoretically always be seeing the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTGcqD"&gt;It’s worth noting that latency can have a few meanings, especially when it comes to online games. Reflex isn’t designed to help improve your &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt; latency, so if you’ve got a bad internet connection it probably won’t help improve your gaming experience all that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADuUkU"&gt;Whether the difference in latency will be noticeable will depend a lot on the type of equipment you’re using, how much better it is, and how eagle-eyed you are. Still, if you’re one of the testers, it’s probably worth turning it on to try it out, and seeing if you notice the improvement. For everyone else, it’s something to look forward to trying out in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWs3yV"&gt;AMD also has a feature meant to reduce input latency on its graphics cards, &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-anti-lag"&gt;called Radeon Anti-Lag&lt;/a&gt;, which can also be turned on for Overwatch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon ordered to temporarily close facility near Toronto due to increase in COVID-19 cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIogwneTwhlOxTXEKcYNplXRnbc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960278/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CC6ekW"&gt;A public health authority has ordered Amazon to close one of its fulfillment centers in Canada for two weeks because of an uptick in the rate of COVID-19 infections at the facility. A public health investigation found that while the rate of COVID-19 infections has been decreasing in the area, the rate inside the Brampton facility, near Toronto, “has been increasing significantly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sn15AD"&gt;Dr. Lawrence C. Loh, the medical officer of health for the Peel region where the facility is located,  said the temporary closure was necessary to help stop the spread of the virus. “This Amazon facility is in a vulnerable community and employs thousands of people. Immediate action must be taken to protect these essential workers and the community where they live,” &lt;a href="https://peelregion.ca/news/archiveitem.asp?year=2021&amp;amp;month=2&amp;amp;day=12&amp;amp;file=2021212.xml"&gt;Loh said in a statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcG1lQ"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, but a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/amazon-ordered-to-close-canadian-facility-on-covid-19-outbreak?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the company disagreed with the health department’s decision, and planned to appeal. Employees at the Brampton facility are required to self-isolate until March 27th under the order, unless they tested positive for the virus in the past 90 days and have already self-quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4Zyb0"&gt;Last March, Kentucky’s governor &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/amazon-says-kentucky-governor-ordered-idling-of-returns-facility?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;ordered an Amazon warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in that state closed following an outbreak, and Amazon temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/20/amazon-closes-new-jersey-warehouse-after-covid-19-infections.html"&gt;closed one of its warehouses in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; back in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGxXpG"&gt;However, throughout the coronavirus pandemic Amazon has continued to operate most of its warehouses and other facilities even when there were outbreaks of the virus. More than 19,000 of its front line workers had tested positive for the virus as of October, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-covid-19-testing"&gt;Amazon’s own figures&lt;/a&gt;, and workers have complained they often learned about outbreaks at their workplaces from external sources, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/lack-oversight-transparency-leave-amazon-employees-dark-covid-19-n1241549"&gt;not from the company directly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Avatar passes Avengers: Endgame to retake box office crown after China re-release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Avatar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPJo7huwKRJBPGbAHcpiSZfy-eY=/64x0:1977x1275/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68960103/avatar16.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 20th Century Fox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gu0U24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; has once again retaken its crown as the most lucrative movie of all time, with James Cameron’s 2009 film reaching a new all-time box office high to beat out 2019’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/21/20702651/avengers-endgame-avatar-biggest-movie-box-office-comic-con-phase-4"&gt;which took the top spot&lt;/a&gt; with its $2.7902 billion take that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SdmW3"&gt;But thanks to a re-release of Avatar in China, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/avatar-overtakes-avengers-endgame-highest-grossing-film-all-time-worldwide-box-office-china-james-cameron-disney-1234713788/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports that &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has already grossed enough to push its box office total to $2.798 billion, which edges out Earth’s Mightiest Heroes once again for largest worldwide total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fksJCi"&gt;The surge in &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; ticket sales comes as China theaters are re-opening in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen a rush of theatergoers eager to return to theaters. And seeing as most major Western film studios have yet to release new titles (given that most of the world has very limited theatrical capacity still), that leaves plenty of room to re-release popular titles like &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; in the meantime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xM9yy"&gt;With the rest of the weekend’s box office still ahead of it, it’s all but guaranteed that Avatar will continue to pad out its lead over &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; over the next several days. It’s the latest development in the ongoing (and slightly petty) fight for the all-time box office record. Back when &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; was in theaters, Disney worked overtime to ensure it would take the top spot, re-releasing the film several weeks after its initial run with promises of an additional deleted scene to drive the numbers up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANrS9m"&gt;It’s also possible that &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; might retake its crown: Disney has ben known to put its Marvel films back in theaters as part of marathons or fan events before major new entries come out. So it’s entirely possible that &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; could return to theaters to make a run at Avatar’s new record in the future — especially if US theaters adopt a similar strategy of re-releasing big past hits to help juice the return to theaters post-COVID over the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNb6ZJ"&gt;Of course, the real winner here is, as usual the Walt Disney Company. With Disney having bought 20th Century Fox (and with it, the &lt;em&gt;Avatar &lt;/em&gt;films) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the company will hold the &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW"&gt;top box office spot&lt;/a&gt; whether &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; ends up on top. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSnjJZxFfPXIwiMIsDuSRqZe4nI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68957792/vpavic_4278_20201030_0073.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYCYSU"&gt;If you missed Target’s PS5 restocks Thursday, you may be in luck. Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; models up for purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJwFGh"&gt;According to the product listing, Best Buy will only allow you to pick up your newly purchased PS5 at a local Best Buy store. No home delivery is available for either model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you get your hands on a PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-Launch-PlayStation/dp/B08FC66ZV4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Z9TQT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh2iyW"&gt;If you plan to play local co-op with family or friends, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; might also be a good item to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;One thing I also recommend buying is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners, that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that released on the console’s predecessor, like &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Bi9M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A hacker who exposed Verkada’s surveillance camera snafu has been raided </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SF security camera privacy stock 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LC_LNv6hJfokUGNWDxoUlHaXTuY=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68959188/2012-03-23_13-44-49-1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZ0kIt"&gt;Tillie Kottmann, a 21-year-old hacker, has been raided by Swiss authorities and their devices seized, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/swiss-police-raid-apartment-of-verkada-hacker-seize-devices?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; — days after helping to reveal how Silicon Valley security startup Verkada’s &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; security was so poor that that hackers were able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322122/verkada-hack-150000-security-cameras-tesla-factory-cloudflare-jails-hospitals"&gt;access over 150,000 of the company’s cameras&lt;/a&gt; to see the insides of schools, jails, hospitals, police stations, and Tesla factories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JruO5P"&gt;The raid doesn’t have anything to do with Verkada, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, but instead an “alleged hack that took place last year,” and interestingly, a Swiss authority pointed &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; to the US Department of Justice for further questions. (The DOJ declined to comment.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG2xVf"&gt;It’s not clear which hack the DOJ might be interested in, as Kottmann has been &lt;em&gt;continually&lt;/em&gt; sharing leaked files from various companies for months, but one sticks out as likely: Kottmann &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intel-leak-20gb-of-source-code-internal-docs-from-alleged-breach/"&gt;leaked a huge collection of secret documents and source code from chipmaker Intel last year&lt;/a&gt;, and Intel vowed to investigate. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it’s seen the search warrant, which mentions that the FBI was looking into the “theft and distribution of information including source code, confidential documents and internal user data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUqwRg"&gt;As of Friday evening, Kottmann’s GitLab repository, which catalogued quite a few leaks, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1370594578391212035"&gt;appears to have been seized&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lr0Td5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That was fast. &lt;a href="https://t.co/blLegD5z37"&gt;https://t.co/blLegD5z37&lt;/a&gt; already seized by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheJusticeDept&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FBI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xYQf2oQOa6"&gt;https://t.co/xYQf2oQOa6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JJAVgLUN9c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JJAVgLUN9c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Artem Russakovskii (@ArtemR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArtemR/status/1370594578391212035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5uPKT"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XBvo3E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another Twitter suspension, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SEu3e1"&gt;Kottmann has suggested in the past that they’ve been unfairly targeted for ethical hacking, particularly by Twitter, which suddenly chose to enforce its rules on ban dodging by suspending &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deletescape"&gt;Kottmann’s account&lt;/a&gt; just a few days after the Intel leak in August 2020. Twitter originally suspended Kottmann for “distribution of hacked material” last June, according to screenshots they shared with me last year, and Twitter confirmed the second suspension was for violating the platform manipulation and spam policy that keeps users from dodging their bans by simply creating a new account. Following the Verkada disclosures, Twitter suspended &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nyancrimew"&gt;Kottmann’s most recent account&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxwjP3"&gt;With leaks like Intel’s, though, Kottmann didn’t just pass along documents to journalists or disclose security holes to companies; they pointed anyone to the hacked material. While you could argue that’s also how we get many new product leaks, source code hacks are usually taken more seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xya0ix"&gt;Either way, it’s leading some hacktivists to question platforms’ decisions to deplatform hackers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v2Uoux"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Why is Twitter so hostile to hacktivists? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Especially considering &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dotMudge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dotMudge&lt;/a&gt;, whose FORMER glory days include being member of Cult of the Dead Cow, who some claim are responsible for giving us the word 'hacktivist' is their current Chief Information Security Officer? &lt;a href="https://t.co/yPIIvq9xYO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yPIIvq9xYO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— punished donk (@donk_enby) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1370270061886377985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8d3be"&gt;(Hacker donk_enby, above, was the one who scraped &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/parlers-amateur-coding-could-come-back-to-haunt-capitol-hill-rioters/"&gt;80 terabytes of videos from Parler&lt;/a&gt;, videos which were later extensively used to reveal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/18/22236750/propublica-parler-capitol-riot-videos-timeline-resource"&gt;what actually occurred during the Capitol Riot&lt;/a&gt;, including as evidence in Trump’s second impeachment trial.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2935v"&gt;It may be a difficult line for platforms to draw. Yesterday, Microsoft-owned GitHub &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vpaz/researcher-publishes-code-to-exploit-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities-on-github"&gt;decided to take down a security researcher’s work&lt;/a&gt; that could have reflected poorly on Microsoft, because the proof-of-concept exploited the holes in Microsoft Exchange Server’s code that were used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;in the huge Hafnium hack&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s argument was that the attack is still occurring and that the code could still be exploited, which does make sense on its face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rA6bKk"&gt;Kottmann (or, at least, someone using an account connected to a recently valid username of Kottmann’s, I’m still trying to confirm) declined to comment on the raid, saying that their previous statements had already resulted in Swiss press harassing their family. Kottmann told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that their parents’ home was searched by Swiss police as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhKoLg"&gt;Kottmann also seems to still have access to a Mastodon account, one that’s currently warning readers to “assume all past communication with me to have been compromised” and “under US control.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KNpQU"&gt;“do not talk to me about any illegal activities or crimes. i do not plan on doing anything illegal for the near future,” reads &lt;a href="https://notbird.site/@deletescape/105877342103653734"&gt;the current pinned post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUzOGq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 13th, 1:13AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Git.rip has apparently been seized by the FBI and DOJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinues the HomePod, but the HomePod mini will live on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="top of the homepod" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/174-vKAIGR1bUhYwRdDez8RQFhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68959072/jbareham_180202_2266_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dRK1FF"&gt;Apple is discontinuing the original, full-size HomePod and will now focus its speaker efforts on the HomePod mini, the company told &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/?tpcc=ECTW2020&amp;amp;guccounter=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; on Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ETn8m"&gt;Here is what Apple said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OSuvgh"&gt;HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hB7LYG"&gt;The Space Grey model of the full-size HomePod is already sold out on Apple’s online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTNVVt"&gt;The full-size HomePod had great sound quality, but it was criticized for its high $349 price tag &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;at launch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple eventually dropped the price to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295084/apple-homepod-price-cut-299-smart-speaker"&gt;$299 in April 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and came out with the $99 HomePod mini last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmf5RK"&gt;The move isn’t altogether surprising; sales of the HomePod have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17366778/apple-homepod-sales-estimate-600-thousand-units-smart-speaker"&gt;reportedly been low&lt;/a&gt;, and in our review, we felt that the HomePod mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;offered good sound&lt;/a&gt; for its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpyaZy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZ9AMA"&gt;Many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are big fans of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368287/emoji-reactions-discussion-conversation-instagram-imessage"&gt;emoji reactions&lt;/a&gt; in Slack, and today we noticed that our newsroom’s Slack now groups emoji reactions with different skin tones into one mass reaction. The feature is now rolling out to everyone, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWGmG5"&gt;Here’s how it works. Let’s say that your colleague dropped a Simpsons-yellow &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/flexed-biceps/"&gt;Flexed Biceps emoji&lt;/a&gt; on a Slack message celebrating someone’s huge accomplishment. If your default skin tone for emoji in Slack is a dark skin tone, and you mash that Simpsons-yellow Flexed Biceps emoji reaction, a dark skin tone emoji will show up alongside the yellow one &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your reaction will be added to the total count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo2zyM"&gt;My editors have allowed me to post this highly secretive message from our internal Slack so you can get an idea of how the grouped emoji reactions look like in practice: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SuI4QP38gIOCcHT-ggcfIs2Z4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366917/Screen_Shot_2021_03_12_at_5.02.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5bZ2j"&gt;I’ve seen emoji reaction groups today with four different skin tones represented, so the feature presumably can group all six of the skin tone options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="im4m0I"&gt;This small change is a huge boon for inclusivity, in my opinion. Now, instead of having to pick between clicking an emoji reaction that doesn’t match your preferred skin tone or adding a new one that better represents you, you can just punch an emoji reaction, no matter the skin tones that are already there, and know that you’ll see yourself represented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNAge5"&gt;“We believe the future of work must be inclusive as it is critical to our success and that of our customers,” Slack said in a statement. “This update to how emoji appear under messages is part of our ongoing effort to help our customers express themselves in ways that feel most authentic to their experience. Diversity, engagement and belonging are core to our company values and we are committed to ensuring that our product reflects that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why game developers can’t get a handle on doors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2EZJhmcMbq2Jgkg_jNQbkVHJqX8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68958370/Nightmare8.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest objects are the most difficult to design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uhuS5I"&gt;The best kind of door in a video game is the one no one remembers. Sure, everyone can appreciate a big, beautiful door with great animations, says Owlchemy Labs developer Pete Galbraith. But in a video game, doors are often synonymous with a massive design headache. Forgettable means a developer has done their job well. “If it fits into the environment, makes sense for its context, and works exactly how the player expects, then in that instant it was simply a door as real as any other in the player’s real life,” says Galbraith. “I can’t imagine higher praise for a door in a game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl9NrY"&gt;Over the past week, dozens of developers across multiple disciplines and teams shared their frustrations on Twitter. &lt;em&gt;Death Trash&lt;/em&gt; creator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/talecrafter/status/1369153361270935554"&gt;Stephan Hövelbrinks&lt;/a&gt; explained that doors “have all sorts of possible bugs.” &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; co-game director &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kurtmargenau/status/1369347886308265985"&gt;Kurt Margenau&lt;/a&gt; called it “the thing that took the longest to get right.” How doors work is different during “combat tension,” when players are mid-encounter, vs. not, for example: doors slowly close automatically during combat, but remain open during exploration. “If a player is going to open a door, it can’t just magically fly open, the character has to reach to the doorknob and push it open,” Margenau explained in one tweet. “But what about closing it behind you? How do you do that while sprinting?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NjWWdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If a door hits an NPC, does the door stop, or does the NPC move? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oC4EiR"&gt;Doors aren’t the only ordinary object developers struggle with. Developers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to point to objects like ropes or mirror. After&lt;em&gt; Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;’s release, one developer on the project spoke at length about how they managed to make the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2021/1/6/22213232/half-life-alyx-liquid-bottle-shaders"&gt;bottles of booze&lt;/a&gt; look so realistic. Designer Liz England points to ladders, elevators, and moving platforms as well. “I think doors themselves tend to get a much bigger reputation for being terrible because they are (1) so much more common in the real world (I use doors every single day!), and (2) are much more common, then, in games, so more people can use it as a touchstone for ‘unexpectedly difficult interactivity,’” England tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ve never had to implement a mirror or a rope, but I have had my fair share of doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZTbU5"&gt;A door isn’t exactly mankind’s best or even smartest invention in the real world. It’s a comically simple concept — open big rectangle for entry or exit — that in development becomes a team-wide problem. As Crystal Dynamics game director Will Kerslake put it in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, there are “so many issues with doors.” In one example, touching specifically on animation, Kerslake explained that doors can open toward or away from you; handles can be on either side. “If you can engage with that door from different states, like crouch or sprinting, then that’s an additional set of animations,” he says. “A door you pull open, requires you to back up in the real world to step out of the way, that’s another set of issues. In a first-person game you can animate the door and not the player, and this is easier. In a high-fidelity third-person game there is an expectation that the player’s hand will move to the handle.” And the players’ location and angle when they engage with any door can and will vary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce7fdr"&gt;Other problems might involve several players all scrabbling for a door at the same time, or even non-player characters. If a door hits an NPC, does the door stop, or does the NPC move? “The choices here can cause all kinds of bugs depending on your game,” says Kerslake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ODhig"&gt;It’s not that making doors in a video game is an impossible task. For some developers, it’s just not worth the trouble. “As a result many games avoid doors in gameplay, you’d be surprised at how many games don’t have interactive doors at all,” says Keslake. “Lots of doorways, but the important doors are missing or already open. The next step up in complexity is doors used only as progress gates, they open only and then can’t be closed again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p68urt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“you’d be surprised at how many games don’t have interactive doors at all”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WTWLaz"&gt;Technical points, of which there are many, set aside, how players process the digital representation of a door matters. Everyone knows how a door works and therefore has a subconscious understanding and expectation of how they move, sound, look. The level of accuracy needed for a player to believe the door is a door is higher for a common object than a fantasy one, says Galbraith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2rBrG"&gt;“Our ideas of how we interact with them are incredibly clear due to the cognitive reinforcement we have received from interacting with them so often in a variety of different ways. For doors like the ones in our homes, we subconsciously learn the minute details of how they act, such as the rate at which they close or how much we can move them while they are locked. So when we see a door in a game that closes too fast or without friction or when there’s a locked door where the handle doesn’t jiggle and make a sound we’ll notice that something isn’t quite right about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt5KKl"&gt;You can still fib it a little. While most doors only go in one direction, for example, game doors will often swing either way. “When these sorts of virtual doors look, sound, and behave like regular doors, then they hit a level of mental acceptance with the player that allows the player to continue without questioning why every door in the game just so happens to open away from them,” Galbraith says. “To them it’s just a weird coincidence that the brain subconsciously chooses to ignore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SONY7S"&gt;Doors aren’t just an aesthetic or immersion technique in video games; often they serve as part of level design. They’re gates that keep players from moving on until they’ve finished a puzzle or beaten a boss; they can act as markers for the player’s progress, build tension, or act as cover. “Doors are just one of a variety of tools that a developer can use when designing levels,” Galbraith says. “Many games employ other methods alongside doors to avoid potential issues and even just to help vary the content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2ZZ1NI"&gt;With one exception: “Unless the door was really tiny and cute, in which case then it’s just a-door-able!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1heEeM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
