    <title>Video game industry wins first Oscar with documentary short Colette</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qib7IMgjm6ZjTnT56NdPGt23484=/0x0:780x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69185502/colette.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ixwc5U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt;, a short film featured in the Oculus VR game &lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;, has won this year’s Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject). Presented by Oculus Studios and Electronic Arts’ Respawn Entertainment, and later acquired and distributed by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, it’s the first time a video game industry project has won an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCUJ5Z"&gt;Directed by Anthony Giacchino, &lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt; features a French Resistance survivor, Colette Marin-Catherine, returning to Germany for the first time since the end of World War II to visit a slave labor camp where her brother was killed. The documentary is presented in a traditional 2D format whether you watch it in the Oculus TV app or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqgAxM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real hero here is Colette herself.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pDCFsK"&gt;“The real hero here is Colette herself, who has shared her story with integrity and strength,” Oculus Studios director of production Mike Doran says in a statement. “As we see in the film, resistance takes courage, but facing one’s past may take even more. Allowing us to preserve this pilgrimage for future generations was a true act of bravery and trust. We hope this award and the film’s reach means, as Colette says, that Jean-Pierre’s memory, as well as all of those who resisted, are no longer lost in the ‘Night and Fog’ of Dora.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbSkag"&gt;“It’s true what they say: It really is an honor just to be nominated. And it’s an incredible moment to win. We’re humbled by this recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and would like to extend our sincere congratulations to all of our fellow nominees. It’s a privilege to stand alongside you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jypwag"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163762/medal-of-honor-above-and-beyond-virtual-reality-vr-review-steam-oculus"&gt;was not well-received as a video game&lt;/a&gt;, with many reviews highlighting its huge system requirements and 170GB installation size — much of which was down to the inclusion of extensive historical and documentary footage. Now that one of those films has won an Oscar, the project may get more positive attention than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvwkNY"&gt;You can watch &lt;em&gt;Colette&lt;/em&gt; for free online &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7uBf1gD6JY"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2Fdeveloper-post%2F454929399107984%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus TV&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/nov/18/colette-a-former-french-resistance-member-confronts-a-family-tragedy-75-years-later"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ingenuity takes its third flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xeQAFs1AJK-vrldW4v9dqjQ9ytY=/36x0:1428x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184344/ingenuity_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ingenuity lifts off from the Martian surface | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka7S42EXPq0&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASAJetPropulsionLaboratory" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1WZuqp"&gt;NASA’s tiny Ingenuity helicopter made its third &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8930/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flies-faster-farther-on-third-flight/"&gt;successful flight on Mars&lt;/a&gt; early Sunday, and flew higher and faster than it did even when it was being tested on Earth. At about 1:31 AM ET, the helicopter ascended 16 feet and flew 164 feet during its 80 second third flight, at a top speed of 6.6 feet per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56rAML"&gt;NASA received the flight data shortly after 10AM ET. “Today’s flight was what we planned for, and yet it was nothing short of amazing,” NASA’s Dave Lavery said in a statement. “With this flight, we are demonstrating critical capabilities that will enable the addition of an aerial dimension to future Mars missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idrzQK"&gt;In its second mission on Thursday, Ingenuity made a 51.9-second flight, traveling seven feet. For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;Ingenuity’s first flight&lt;/a&gt; on April 19th, the little craft lifted 10 feet off the surface of Mars for 39 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d56BMM"&gt;Ingenuity arrived on Mars February 18th with its parent rover Perseverance, whose mission is to look for signs of life and take Martian soil samples. While Ingenuity isn’t the main focus of the Perseverance mission, its ability to fly in Mars’ thin atmosphere will provide data useful for future explorations of Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqmXP4"&gt;NASA says it’s planning a fourth flight for Ingenuity in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Ted Lasso, Fathom, Annette, The Conjuring, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKrsNUueXMk8mDl_JgMmWfWsFYw=/459x0:4679x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184273/1310834710.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ted Lasso returns | Photo by SAGAwards2021 via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmCS8F"&gt;The Oscars are tonight and despite my best efforts I still haven’t seen all the Best Picture contenders, so will hold off on making predictions (but honestly not sure how anyone beats Chadwick Boseman as Best Actor). Lots of good trailers this week including the return of the most wholesome show on all of streaming and the next big Marvel movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GzBVA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ldLYIo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auxeLrtk7tk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3Q4Mqy"&gt;Ted Lasso Season 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l1kA0H"&gt;You know when you really love a show and it gets popular and everyone else likes it... and you brace for its sophomore season to be not quite as good as its debut? I am hopeful that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will not fall into this pattern, and the trailer for season two looks extremely promising (Ted: “Back home if a team was playing poorly, we don’t call them unlucky, what do we call ‘em, Coach?” Beard: “New York Jets.”) Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt, Hannah Waddingham, and Juno Temple return along with others from season one for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which drops on Apple TV Plus July 23rd. And if you’re interested in a little bonus Ted Lasso content, developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401368/ted-lasso-shortbread-recipe-apple-spring-loaded"&gt;David Smith managed to figure out the recipe&lt;/a&gt; for the shortbread cookies Ted makes for Hannah. So wholesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOyvfq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fKPdgr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giWIr7U1deA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntvp1"&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f8WmqO"&gt;The next big Marvel movie is the first to center an Asian superhero (and has an almost entirely Asian cast) and it looks very, very fun even if you don’t know the backstory and &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Shang-Chi"&gt;connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt;. Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi, whose father trained him as a child to be an assassin. He tries to escape and live a normal life but as anyone who has ever watched a superhero movie knows, it ain’t that easy. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Awkwafina also star in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters September 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FG26RZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/On4v1gNJkrE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oZMzpo"&gt;Annette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kPckMD"&gt;Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard play a comedian and opera singer who fall in love and have a child they name Annette, “a mysterious little girl with an exceptional destiny.”  The trailer has that French cinema feel, for sure, which makes sense, since &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; is the English-language debut of French director Leos Carax. &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; will open the 74th Cannes Film Festival on July 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yYkxUl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-Mmnk0LZLU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wrXtlc"&gt;Fathom &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6HDsVS"&gt;Scientists Michelle Fournet and Ellen Garland embark on separate research trips in opposite hemispheres to try to better understand the songs of humpback whales. No one really knows why whales “sing,” despite decades of research. It’s challenging work that one of the scientists compares to “pointing all of our satellites skyward and listening from a sign from outer space.” The trailer is just beautiful (obviously watch with the sound on).  &lt;em&gt;Fathom&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Apple TV Plus June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sALjCB"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="CWRzzU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3v8n_8-QqA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GE0M4W"&gt;Here Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9eszwm"&gt;Billy Crystal wrote, directed, and stars in this movie about an aging comedy writer who befriends a woman (Tiffany Haddish) whose boyfriend bet on a date with him at an auction. Who would not be content to just watch Haddish and Crystal just bounce jokes off each other for 90 minutes? The underlying premise, though, is that Crystal is losing his memory and Haddish steps up to help him. &lt;em&gt;Here Today&lt;/em&gt; arrives in theaters May 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yVXoUU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9Q4zZS2v1k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8fA9eW"&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uxBpNr"&gt;I continue to be surprised at the endurance of The Conjuring movies, which continue to be quite scary. I have to be honest that I’m not a super big fan of these movies because of the way they often put children in terrifying situations, a theme which seems to persist in this latest installment. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are back to investigate a murder committed by a young man who claims he was possessed by the devil. &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/em&gt; premieres on HBO Max and in theaters on June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse is partnering with the NFL for draft week programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkDEQ3sBHBC61VKEtYSTb5L4UJ8=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183494/1232148642.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EDvW3o"&gt;Audio social platform Clubhouse is partnering with the National Football League for some exclusive programming during the upcoming NFL draft, the company announced Sunday. This is the first sports partnership for Clubhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlrD86"&gt;The NFL will host a series of &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/club/NFL"&gt;draft-themed rooms&lt;/a&gt; on Clubhouse beginning Monday and throughout the week, which will include player assessments, a mock draft for fans, and a conversation with football team alumni from the University of Alabama. Football fans can drop into the NFL rooms on Clubhouse to follow the picks as they’re announced and listen to “discussions featuring key NFL figures—from athletes and coaches to network personalities,” according to a release from Clubhouse, and fans could be invited on stage by moderators to ask draft questions or share reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9506HW"&gt;Clubhouse had a huge first year, with more than 10 million downloads, and sparked a raft of competing audio products from Twitter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Its March 2020 debut came at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, when people were isolating and turning to online platforms to keep in touch with friends and family. Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported Clubhouse was valued at around $4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhgMoO"&gt;Clubhouse is still invitation-only, and is not yet available on Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t6h35G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Can Clubhouse keep the party going?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BKuhVn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what Neymar looks like in Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_gsEsZA4yF905TJYcCi8D8YQME=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183086/Neymar_Jr_Outfits.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2uEFcT"&gt;We’ve known that Brazilian soccer star Neymar was coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; since March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;when he was teased as part of the battle royale’s latest season&lt;/a&gt; — and now we finally know what he’ll look like. Today, Epic revealed Neymar’s video game look, which, in traditional &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fashion, gets pretty outlandish, with unlockable outfits that look ripped straight out of Power Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHI89T"&gt;Curiously, Neymar isn’t sporting jerseys for either the Brazil national team or his club, Paris St. Germain, despite the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;licensed team kits were introduced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out Neymar’s accessories in the image below. Neymar and his gear — including some new quests — will be available on April 27th for anyone who purchased the current pass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYJnAzQXHD-FDVyhA-70MZc4oSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465514/Neymar_Jr_Cosmetics.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qTxlFA"&gt;Neymar is the first pro athlete to be featured in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but he’s far from the first celebrity. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;plenty of fictional characters&lt;/a&gt;, the battle royale has added skins based on music stars like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;, along with streamers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Ninja&lt;/a&gt;, Loserfruit, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics"&gt;TheGrefg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oscars 2021: how to watch the Academy Awards online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yfX7ev-nEfQbM9pV8FEqVWNgwRw=/180x0:5408x3485/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183448/C7_03745_R2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dm8G5B"&gt;The 93rd Academy Awards (also known as the Oscars) will broadcast tonight, April 25th. This ceremony will recognize the films and their associated talent in a particularly strange and difficult year for the industry, which has been forced to adapt to some big changes during the pandemic. Cinemas weren’t where most people saw newly-released movies. Instead, many of those films were pushed faster than ever to digital distribution platforms like Vudu, Apple TV, and Google TV for purchase or rental. Some were even made available simultaneously with the theatrical release, like some Warner Bros. films on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=HowToWatchOscars2021"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh2iIE"&gt;This year’s Oscars are happening later in the year than usual, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/15/21291946/academy-awards-oscars-ceremony-delayed-eligibility-dates-change"&gt;apparently to make room for more movies&lt;/a&gt;, since the pandemic dried up the release schedule. In addition, this year’s ceremony marks the first time that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240422/oscars-streaming-theaters-rules-2021-netflix-digital-release-academy"&gt;some streaming-only movies&lt;/a&gt; will qualify for an Oscar award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQJRmr"&gt;Despite all that, we’re here to tell you how to watch the show that celebrates the movies of the year and the people who helped make them possible. First, we’ll dig into when and how you can watch the stream, then we’ll dig into the nominations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HFbpoY"&gt;WHO’S HOSTING THE OSCARS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i8H1vZ"&gt;In 2019, the Academy Awards were host-less for the first time in 30 years, and this year will be the same. Instead of relying on a single host, there will be a cast of presenters, including Angela Bassett, Halle Berry, Bong Joon Ho, Don Cheadle, Steven Yeun, Bryan Cranston, Laura Dern, Harrison Ford, Regina King, Marlee Matlin, Rita Morena, Joaquin Phoenix, Brad Pitt, Reese Witherspoon, Renée Zellweger, and Zendaya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KMEWdh"&gt;WHAT TIME DO THE OSCARS START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jh8GOV"&gt;ABC is handling the televised stream, which starts at 8PM ET / 5PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dBjgLu"&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE ACADEMY AWARDS ONLINE?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ioZcHO"&gt;ABC is accessible for free in the US via an over-the-air antenna, but otherwise, you’ll have to be a subscriber to a service to gain access to the awards show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMbovt"&gt;You can watch it on the ABC channel on cable or satellite, or you can watch through your browser by &lt;a href="http://abc.com/watch-live"&gt;logging in to ABC’s site&lt;/a&gt; with your cable or satellite credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqer38"&gt;Alternatively, several streaming services offer ABC with a subscription. Availability varies by region, but most people who subscribe to YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, Sling TV, and FuboTV should have access. And if you only want to watch for this one night, you’ll be happy to know that all of these services offer free trials of varying lengths (though all require credit card information to sign up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G0Icxh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=852731.37&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;u1=VergeOscars2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c9WD9u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/intro/"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TYj5yb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/http://sling.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7VeSpx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fstream%2Foscars-on-abc%2F%3Firad%3D1043433%26irmp%3D482924%26subId1%3DVerge&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FuboTV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="XiaNFG"&gt;Finally, if you can wait until May 2nd, that’s when ABC will make the Oscars free to watch on its site without requiring a log-in, &lt;a href="https://support.abc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057911871-Can-I-watch-The-Oscars-awards-ceremony-on-demand-"&gt;according to its FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mo6IaJ"&gt;HOW DO I WATCH THE CEREMONY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I4c9qy"&gt;ABC hasn’t updated its list of international partners that will broadcast the Oscars, though &lt;a href="https://www.oscars.org/news/93rd-oscarsr-all-star-cast-revealed"&gt;its site says&lt;/a&gt; that the Oscars will be televised live in more than 225 countries and territories worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roAhtL"&gt;WHAT ARE THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xBiHwr"&gt;Our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;has put together a comprehensive post that has all of the 2021 nominations. You can &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22325242/oscar-nominations-2021-list"&gt;check that out right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Batman: Zero Point, Fortnite’s lore makes a lot more sense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSonHD0SicbP_GCoiwFa0NfBt38=/0x1320:3089x3379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183355/BMFNZP_Cv1__FINAL_MAIN_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFvpna"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPzUSO"&gt;I’ve played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; over the years, but I’ve never really thought about the internal lives of the many characters that inhabit the battle royale island. I was always too busy seeking shelter and supplies or exploring whatever big event was happening at the time. But now that I’ve read &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt;, a crossover between Batman and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, I can’t stop thinking about what’s actually happening to them as they fight to the death over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fjlf48"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt; Z&lt;em&gt;ero Point &lt;/em&gt;is a new six-issue series — the first is available now — that attempts to make sense of the convoluted world of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. At the outset, a mysterious crack appears in Gotham’s skies, and Batman heads out to investigate. He spots Harley Quinn by the disturbance and is eventually pulled into it against his will. As you can probably guess, on the other side of the rift is the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="m6A5T0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkFGvO"&gt;Batman immediately notices some strange things about this unknown place. He seems to be suffering from some form of amnesia; aside from some muscle memory — i.e., the ability to fight and use gadgets — he can’t remember anything about who he is. He also can’t talk, and for some reason, everyone is trying to kill each other. At one point, he posits a possible explanation: “I’ve gone mad.” It isn’t until he sees Catwoman that his memory is jostled just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjoufY"&gt;The issue ends without much resolution, but it poses a lot of questions I’ve never really considered much before. Why &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; the characters talk? And is there a reason everyone is actually trying to kill each other? The developers at Epic Games have steadily been building out the lore of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through in-game events and other means, even tying in some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;the many licensed characters that have been added&lt;/a&gt;. But the comic goes in a different direction. Reading it is like seeing what goes through Batman’s head in the middle of a battle royale match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ziurb2"&gt;It’s completely weird and utterly fascinating — and I’m very curious where it’s headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpNCNd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; is written by Christos Gage, with art by Nelson Faro DeCastro, Reilly Brown, and John Kalisz. Donald Mustard — the chief creative officer at Epic — is listed as a story consultant. (He also apparently made &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldMustard/status/1385013506961858563"&gt;a variant cover&lt;/a&gt; for the second issue.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0Xy8G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; is available both in physical and digital forms, but there are some small complications. If you grab either a physical issue or read through DC Universe Infinite, you’ll get some bonus in-game items via a code; for issue one, that means a Harley Quinn &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; character. However, if you pick up an issue via Comixology, you won’t get a code, just the book. Issue 1 is available now, with subsequent issues coming on May 4th, May 18th, June 1st, June 15th, and July 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media platforms become triage centers as India struggles with a COVID-19 surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Family members of Covid-19 infected patients stand in a queue with empty oxygen cylinders outside the oxygen filling center in New Delhi on Friday." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0Y7Q7YN60RlC247Zc_metkeebs=/14x0:2986x1981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183314/1232488568.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1kmP1W"&gt;Doctors, hospital owners, journalists, and other Twitter users in India have been tweeting and amplifying pleas for oxygen supplies on social platforms out of desperation, as new coronavirus cases and deaths there hit record highs. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56841381"&gt;Oxygen supplies are at critical low levels&lt;/a&gt; in India, and some hospitals are overwhelmed with patients suffering from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pR7xWJ"&gt;Using hashtags like #CovidSOS and #COVIDEmergency2021, many in India are seeking ICU beds, oxygen, and plasma, and others have tried to direct those in need to suppliers. &lt;a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/Hr4LlyNHLiuETGzmdVgpsR?fbclid=IwAR0ahsmXkoHIPgxyzBmG6kf7E9HNeVNtLVAI6MtGsxwQz4Ug7-mWDgzThgU"&gt;Groups on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/humankindglobal"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.codastory.com/waronscience/indian-teens-plasma-icu-twitter-hospitals/"&gt;inundated with posts&lt;/a&gt; from people in need of ICU beds, oxygen, and other supplies, as organizations like HumanKind Global try to track down leads to help them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CDXbDh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oxygen supply to last only half an hour now, more than 200 lives are at stake. We lost 20 people amid an oxygen shortage last night: DK Baluja, Jaipur Golden Hospital&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidSOS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CovidSOS&lt;/a&gt; Call from A Delhi Hospital &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDEmergency2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVIDEmergency2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/htE5HNgoze"&gt;https://t.co/htE5HNgoze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hemant Rajaura (@hemantrajora_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hemantrajora_/status/1385823190455263233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQAyr"&gt;“Not only there is lack of oxygen supply for those who can’t get medical aid in a hospital, the hospitals too are scurrying for oxygen,” journalist Abhishek Baxi wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Over the past several days, Baxi said, pleas for oxygen supplies on Twitter have increased “because they’ve not had any response from the authorities. There are updates on news channels about X hospital left with only few hours of oxygen or Y hospital optimizing supply to patients because they’ve got only 2 hours of oxygen supply left. These hospitals, their hands tied, have requested patients to go elsewhere – something not possible in a city where all hospitals are bursting at the seams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KUOxU"&gt;On Saturday, 20 patients died in a hospital in New Delhi due to depleted oxygen supply, the &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/20-patient-die-at-delhi-s-jaipur-golden-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101619241779360.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvAgUF"&gt;India is reeling from a second wave of COVID-19 cases. According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource center, India reported &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;349,691 new cases on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, a new record. The country reported 2,767 deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, also a new record. Less than 1.6 percent of the country’s population has been fully vaccinated, the Johns Hopkins data show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esdr2e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-deaths.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;/a&gt;that the situation may be even more dire than the numbers suggest, with officials in India downplaying or overlooking COVID-19 deaths. And at the Indian government’s demand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;Twitter censored more than 50 posts&lt;/a&gt; critical of the government’s handling of the latest coronavirus surge, so the tweets were not visible within India. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/business/india-covid19-twitter-facebook.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Indian government had ordered posts removed from Facebook and Instagram as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The isolation of grief in the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmKaVyf01WghYfte60lezM1UW_A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69183241/acastro_210422_4549_griefIsolation_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pandemic separates us when we need people most&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Vtv0uG"&gt;Many people adopted a pet during the COVID-19 pandemic. My wife and I just lost one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFTbVm"&gt;Gouda, our eight-and-a-half-year-old exotic shorthair cat, died on April 16th. We rushed him to the hospital the previous morning after he spent another night vomiting. The doctors weren’t sure what was wrong, but, over the course of 24 hours, signs pointed to fatal kidney disease. We made the difficult choice to euthanize him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byhG2M"&gt;The events would have been horrible under any circumstances. But I found that the forced isolation of the pandemic made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202122/coronavirus-grief-mourning-isolation-funeral-die-alone"&gt;grieving a lost family member&lt;/a&gt; even more challenging than I could have possibly imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KW3Uli"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We were stranded in pods of sadness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ylOP"&gt;My wife and I spent the majority of the 24 hours inside a Zipcar parked outside the animal hospital. Due to safety regulations, we couldn’t wait in the lobby, so we — and all of the other families worried about their pets — waited alone in our cars. Despite being feet away from each other, we were all worlds apart, stranded in pods of sadness made of metal and glass. Once, we watched as a woman handed off her cat to the veterinary staff, got back in her car, and broke down sobbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC2n68"&gt;We spent hours staring blankly at the tall hedges in front of our car. My wife’s iPhone was a lifeline and a curse. With each passing second, we desperately hoped for a call, but each time the phone finally rang, the news was worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRpbJA"&gt;As we attempted to sleep in the Zipcar overnight, the phone was perched on the dashboard. I stared at it in between fits of sleep, dreading when it would ring. We could never talk to the vets in person, meaning we couldn’t see body language, facial expressions, eye contact — nonverbal cues that would have helped us make the most difficult decision of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8iG8Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our masks filled with snot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cr4jo7"&gt;When we went in to see Gouda for our final goodbye, we sat in a dimly lit room on a soft couch. Our masks constantly filled up with snot. From the other side of the room, the staff told us we couldn’t be with Gouda when he died. There would be no easy way to be six feet apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3UhCy"&gt;The only time we were close to another human being is when they handed Gouda to us, wrapped in a blanket, cone around his neck, and drugged out of his mind. As soon as we were alone with him, we ripped off our masks so we could kiss him one last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8uY69"&gt;We got the last phone call on the ride home from the hospital. Gouda had died peacefully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlElFN"&gt;Right after, my wife and I realized we didn’t want to be home, but we had nowhere else to go. We’re not vaccinated from COVID-19 yet, so we can’t see our family or friends in person to find solace. We couldn’t escape our empty studio apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5AbA3"&gt;Out of habit, we opened the front door gingerly. Every day for more than eight and a half years, Gouda had always greeted us, sometimes throwing his whole body against the door in his excitement to see us. But he wasn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jvZ4l"&gt;Instead, we saw his food bowl, his scratching post, his toys. Our apartment had been the one place we had felt truly safe during the pandemic, but it was now filled with reminders of our missing family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSUkaU"&gt;So we began to clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1RiFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We had to face this part of the grief as just the two of us&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uyJS6g"&gt;Usually, getting rid of things comes easily to my wife and me. We have internalized much of what Marie Kondo writes about in &lt;em&gt;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up&lt;/em&gt;. But this was different. It was harder than any cleaning we had done before &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; the things we got rid of were the reminders of our missing family member. We couldn’t fully move on if we kept them, but that didn’t make it easy to let them go. And because of the pandemic, we couldn’t ask others to come over and help. We had to face this part of the grief as just the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvIt1L"&gt;I will never know how grieving this death would have been different if we weren’t still in the pandemic. I do think it made the worst moments even worse. It trapped us in our car. It kept us from him in the hospital. It separated us from our families. It locked us in our home with the memories of our lost family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwBATZ"&gt;And yet, the pandemic forces us to face our grief head-on. My wife and I are healing, slowly. We spend the day crying and remembering. We say one nice thing about Gouda before bed. Because we are vulnerable with each other, I don’t feel like I’m bottling up any feelings, so my mind doesn’t race, and I can go to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CPNOsB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I thanked every one of Gouda’s things&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QpRPDX"&gt;Kondo recommends thanking objects that you remove from your house to acknowledge the role they played in your life. I did that for every one of Gouda’s things. “Thank you, scratching post,” I said. “Thank you, plastic Easter egg. Thank you, food placemat.” I even thanked his litter box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhsbvP"&gt;Thanking Gouda’s things may sound trivial. But it was one of the few rituals left to me during the pandemic, when so much has been taken away, and it helped me recognize everything that Gouda gave to me. He taught me responsibility, caring for and feeding him every day. He taught me how to play, crouching just out of sight around the bed so that he could spring toward me. He taught me about love, snuggled above my head on my pillow in the middle of the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="a5y06w"&gt;Thank you, Gouda.&lt;/p&gt;
