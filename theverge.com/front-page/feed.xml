    <title>US officials publicly question AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine data </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjsTM0"&gt;In a highly unusual statement issued &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaid-statement-astrazeneca-vaccine"&gt;early this morning&lt;/a&gt;, United States health officials said that the data released by AstraZeneca on its COVID-19 vaccine may include “outdated information.” The announcement, which came from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), comes less than a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344191/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-effective-us-study-disease-protection-fda"&gt;the pharmaceutical company said&lt;/a&gt; its vaccine was highly effective in the US trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xaWgsN"&gt;The NIAID said that the independent board of experts reviewing data from the trial raised concerns about the publicly released data. It “may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,” the agency said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxQxfn"&gt;The announcement may contribute to some unnecessary hesitancy around the AstraZeneca vaccine, Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, said &lt;a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/fauci-discusses-concerns-oxfordastrazeneca-vaccine-data-76626319"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65NWdP"&gt;“This is really what you call an unforced error because the fact is, this is very likely a very good vaccine,” he said. “If you look at it the data, they really are quite good, but when they put it into the press release, it wasn’t completely accurate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk4bfr"&gt;AstraZeneca said &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/update-following-statement-by-niaid-on-azd1222-us-phase-iii-trial-data.html"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the information it released was based on data collected up until February 17th. The company said it is analyzing the most recent data now and will share it within 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqmRzX"&gt;Typically, disagreements between companies and the independent boards overseeing their trials don’t happen in public, clinical trials expert Eric Topol &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/world/us-health-officials-question-results-from-astrazenecas-vaccine-trial-less-than-a-day-after-theyre-released.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Topol, who also directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hHmhwo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though it does give me increased confidence in the other existing options. The experts *are* watching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NIAID Statement on AstraZeneca Vaccine | National Institutes of Health (NIH) &lt;a href="https://t.co/KYHFDKmsJ5"&gt;https://t.co/KYHFDKmsJ5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeremy Faust MD MS (ER physician) (@jeremyfaust) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyfaust/status/1374249040767037442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nc98jY"&gt;This morning’s announcement is the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274371/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-south-africa-variant"&gt;long line of issues&lt;/a&gt; with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The company hasn’t been as transparent with regulators as it should and gave some clinical trial participants in the United Kingdom the wrong dose of its vaccine. European doctors raised &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/it-s-very-special-picture-why-vaccine-safety-experts-put-brakes-astrazeneca-s-covid-19"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; after some people had unusual clotting disorders after receiving the vaccine. Experts hoped that yesterday’s announcement, which included data from the large and tightly controlled US clinical trial, would help clarify lingering questions about the vaccine and restore some confidence in the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1I9aAX"&gt;If and when AstraZeneca applies for authorization in the US, it will have to send all of the data from the US clinical trial to the Food and Drug Administration. Agency scientists will publish their independent analysis publicly, which will give experts the opportunity to review it as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkT5As"&gt;The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is already being used in multiple countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFSyr4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The startup trying to augment audio reality in public spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spatial Studio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NONWlcq2CIJ6bb5tHCObA8_0c4Y=/0x117:2200x1584/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69010873/Spatial_Studio_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spatial Studio | Spatial&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHEoLq"&gt;A startup called &lt;a href="http://spatialinc.com/"&gt;Spatial&lt;/a&gt; is unveiling its first suite of products today, focused on creating audio experiences that are immersive, interactive, and automatically generated. The products themselves are a little complicated to explain, but the result is simple: ambient and interactive audio for public spaces that’s easy to create and more dynamic than the usual tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZdVKO"&gt;Although Spatial has a consumer offering, the most likely customers are going to be businesses. Think hotels that want a different audio experience in their lobby, theme parks that want to develop audio for their spaces faster, brand activations, or AR experiences (&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; is an investor). Think about how corny the canned audio at the zoo often is; Spatial wants to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBD2Re"&gt;In one demo a couple of weeks ago, I sat in a room and heard the sounds of a forest all around me, with birds chirping in one spot and then moving to another — until a dragon flew overhead and scared them all away for a little while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T1ep3f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Positioning audio in space is the easy part&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7XFmW"&gt;That’s frankly nothing special: audio positioned in space is simple. What’s complex is the engine that created all of that audio. Spatial’s goal is to make designing custom sound for a space easy and also to make that sound happen generatively instead of on a loop or a track. There are three main pieces to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7bX16"&gt;First, there’s Spatial Studio, a Mac app that’s a sort of unholy melding of Logic and Unreal Engine. It defines a 3D space where users can place audio objects – either sounds they’ve created themselves or pulled from Spatial’s library. Users can even pipe in live audio as an object – say, if they want to bring the sound of the nearby ocean up into the lobby or just run a Sonos stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKOnWG"&gt;What’s special about Spatial is that those audio objects have behaviors. A bird might move along a predetermined track (with some randomness so it doesn’t get boring) or an ocean tide might appear at certain times of day, for example. Those audio objects might also react — either to each other or to something that happens in the real space. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0bcwRTmT-XibV6g3Xv4MRtDmqdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390168/Spatial_Control_01.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g94Am3"&gt;The second part of Spatial’s system is turning all those dynamic audio objects into actual sound that you can hear in a space. For that, it uses Mac minis (or, for corporate customers, Linux) to run a real-time audio engine called Spatial Reality. It will take inputs from various sensors if need be, or simply let the little audio world run its course — and since the things in that little audio world have different behaviors, it will sound different all of the time. Spatial has also created an iPhone app for more direct interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jkB5C"&gt;You’d think the third part is the speakers, but that’s actually Spatial’s third trick: it can work with any speaker setup. Spatial’s engine serves as an abstraction layer that is aware of the speakers’ position in the room and automatically adjusts the sound to ensure correct 3D positioning of the audio. Instead of a strict set of placement rules, Spatial can work with what you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XQE0DI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spatial doesn’t require specific speakers, or even specific speaker placement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wFkeWh"&gt;Michael Plitkins, one of the cofounders, tells me that fundamentally he believes that laying down audio on a static track is backwards. It’s better, he says, to let the computers figure it out in real time based on what they know about the speaker system. As the product stands right now, Spatial isn’t bothering with any real-time tuning to the audio in the room. It will work with any speaker setup, but users will need to program in what they have in the Spatial Studio app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbtqD0"&gt;At the start, Spatial’s main competition is some combination of Muzak for public spaces and whatever custom tools Disney Imagineers use for the audio in their theme parks. It may appeal to some hobbyists too — part of the inspiration for the company was Plitkins’ desire to create a soundscape in his own back yard. I had a demo of that space too, complete with cave sounds under the deck so authentic it was eerie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saQQDy"&gt;Whomever the customers end up being, it probably won’t be an easy sell. (And launching a product meant mainly for public spaces while a pandemic is still on is another challenge.) Dynamically created rain and birdsong doesn’t sound any different from a static audio track if you only listen for a couple minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSDBhB"&gt;But during a long interview in a conference room where the team explained the ins and outs of their product, they turned off the cabin in the woods-themed audio that had been gently playing the whole time. The silence was weirdly stressful, the way conference rooms usually are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The street prices of Nvidia and AMD GPUs are utterly out of control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b61J78XNrZZ7v2P-VbALpotIWTU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69010875/shollister_201117_4303_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7QIew6"&gt;You might have heard there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; going on, and that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;PC graphics cards in particular&lt;/a&gt; are nearly impossible to find. What you probably haven’t heard is that the situation has steadily been growing worse — to the point some GPUs are worth &lt;em&gt;triple&lt;/em&gt; their MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EySBO"&gt;Above, you’ll see a photo of two graphics cards, the $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 and the $579 AMD Radeon RX 6800. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;I calculated that the true street price of these cards&lt;/a&gt; had reached $819 and $841, respectively, or $1,660 for the pair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxcNwp"&gt;That very same photo now contains $2,570 worth of GPUs. That’s not the asking price, mind you; people are actually paying over $1,200 on the open market, on average, for each of these graphics cards. And that isn’t even as bad as it gets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qckotG"&gt;This past week, I ran the PS5, Xbox Series X, and each of Nvidia’s and AMD’s new graphics cards through an open-source eBay scraper tool to figure out how much they’re worth on average over a seven-day period (big thanks &lt;a href="https://github.com/driscoll42/ebayMarketAnalyzer"&gt;to data analyst Michael Driscoll&lt;/a&gt;), then spent a handful of hours validating the results and weeding out fakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7cVaY"&gt;TL;DR: while the PS5 and Xboxes have actually cooled off a bit, you’ll pay double, even &lt;em&gt;triple&lt;/em&gt; for a new AMD or Nvidia GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="92KxXS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10407549"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rnkNHz"&gt;Frankly, I’m not sure which numbers are the most staggering here. Is it that the supposedly $329 RTX 3060 fetches over $800 on average, or that the RTX 3090 and 3080 are each worth $900 more than they were just three months ago? Or maybe is it that my own 3060 Ti, which I finally managed to snap up for its retail price of $399 after months of trying, could sell for $1,200 now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FK1PfU"&gt;I also looked at just how many of these items are actually getting sold on eBay, which can give you an idea of just how skewed the supply / demand equation is. For instance: over a seven-day period, eBay moved 5,284 PS5 consoles, and yet plenty of PS5s that were listed didn’t sell. PS5 scalping is becoming less profitable, eBay’s getting flooded, and things are slowing down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ib6SIF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10407655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yKIlEJ"&gt;Yet on the PC GPU side of things, it’s the opposite. Every single GPU seems to be selling unless they’re listed well above the average sale price, and there are a precious few of them to go around — just 83 of AMD’s RX 6800 and 141 of Nvidia’s RTX 3060 Ti changed hands during the same seven-day period as far as I can tell. There’s nothing here to suggest scalping will slow anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGdnNW"&gt;It doesn’t help that the actual retail prices of these graphics cards have been edging northward, too. Whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;a reaction to the Trump tariffs or a blatant attempt to get a piece of the action&lt;/a&gt;, the GPUs that I actually do briefly see for sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Neweggs of the world are often far, far above the prices that AMD and Nvidia suggest, like an $840 RTX 3070 or a $900 RX 6800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;The average list price for a $329.99 RTX 3060 was $471 on launch day&lt;/a&gt;. And while Newegg’s raffle originally seemed like a potentially fair way to pay retail, it’s almost become a parody now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IEu5ak"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today it's just $540 for a $330 video card. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you win a raffle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madness. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mY4nPEpoE7"&gt;https://t.co/mY4nPEpoE7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1371538511271141378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PMdeT2"&gt;And yet when that $330 video card that you buy for $540 might get scalped for $830, it’s hard to be surprised when MSI and Newegg decide they want to extract a couple hundred dollars of that for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jkrxb1"&gt;The question, as always, is when AMD and Nvidia are going to be able to produce more than a trickle of new graphics cards to address this pent-up demand, and I’m afraid the tea leaves aren’t looking particularly good. AMD’s promise of making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310653/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-price-release-date-availability-gpu-graphics"&gt;“significantly more GPUs available” and regularly refreshing stock at its own website&lt;/a&gt; haven’t made a meaningful dent so far. And while Nvidia previously warned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;it might take until late April&lt;/a&gt; for things to turn around, &lt;a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210315PD201.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitimes&lt;/em&gt; now says&lt;/a&gt; sources at graphics card manufacturers expect Nvidia’s 30-series GPUs to stay in short supply through the third quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RtYNtR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia made $5 billion during a GPU shortage and expects to do it again in Q1","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299505/nvidia-earnings-q4-2021-quarterly-gpu-shortage-revenue"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT review: Nvidia wins this round","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/3/17/22334662/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 review: $329 with an asterisk sign","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Y7vZhh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google expands cloud chip design efforts with veteran Intel hire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgQxqJTdjudGULxbXOsa0HXYlhw=/388x0:1764x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69010770/compute.max_2200x2200.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BrguwF"&gt;Google is expanding efforts to design its own chips with the hiring of Uri Frank, an Intel veteran with over two decades of experience in custom CPU design, the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-past-present-and-future-of-custom-compute-at-google"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Frank will head up a new Isreal-based team for Google, and will serve as the company’s VP of Engineering for server chip design. “I look forward to growing a team here in Israel while accelerating Google Cloud’s innovations in compute infrastructure,” Frank &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Furi-frank-95ab5330_build-for-everyone-google-careers-activity-6779764218351771648-dm7L%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F23%2F22346125%2Fgoogle-system-on-chip-custom-server-intel-veteran-uri-frank-hire" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUFrch"&gt;As Google and other tech giants have sought more performance and power efficiency, they’ve increasingly turned towards custom chip designs tailored towards specific use cases. Google has already introduced several custom chips including its Tensor Processing Unit (to help with tasks like voice search and photo object recognition), Video Processing Units, and OpenTitan, an open-source security-focused chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxXRSO"&gt;On the consumer side, Google already designs custom chips like the Titan M and Pixel Neural Core for its phones. There have also been reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;Google is designing processors&lt;/a&gt; that could eventually power its Pixel phones and Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vIHV1R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The SoC is the new motherboard”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shKShh"&gt;Despite the hire, Google cautions that it’s not planning on building every server chip itself. “We buy where it makes sense, build it ourselves where we have to, and aim to build ecosystems that benefit the entire industry,” the company explains. But the big change will be trying to integrate these different pieces of hardware on a single system on chip (SoC), rather than via a motherboard where they’re separated by “inches of wires” that introduce latency and reduce bandwidth. “The SoC is the new motherboard,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vy9IYi"&gt;Other tech giants have similar custom chip ambitions. Amazon has its &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd"&gt;ARM-based Graviton server chips&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2019/03/14/data-center-engineering/accelerating-infrastructure/"&gt;Facebook has announced&lt;/a&gt; data center chip designs of its own. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; is also thought to be working on designing its own server chips, as well as processors for its lineup of Surface PCs. Apple has several chip designs to its credit, and is currently in the process of transitioning its Mac lineup from Intel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;its own ARM-based processors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the OnePlus 9 series launch event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fTykhbR7ZGxiq-zZ581xRs2aa0=/222x0:2451x1486/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69010374/Screen_Shot_2021_03_16_at_4.38.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DaDqJi"&gt;Android phones by OnePlus have a considerable set of fans, and if you count yourself among their number, you will probably want to be in on this year’s launch of the company’s latest line: the OnePlus 9 series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GGnO3"&gt;What’s in store? Well, in its videos, OnePlus is touting Fluid Display 2.0, an OLED panel which is supposed to have a really fast refresh rate while still (according to the company) maintaining an impressive battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315517/oneplus-9-launch-date-hasselblad-camera"&gt;There is the possibility of three models&lt;/a&gt; — OnePlus 9, 9 Pro, and 9R — and perhaps a new watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXZKiJ"&gt;For more information, the best thing to do is to attend the event. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google fixes issue causing Android apps to crash with updates to Chrome and WebView </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naDA8Nsuq_s656I6Ht2zbSxi95Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009525/wjoel_180413_1777_android_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iUh0l6"&gt;Some apps were crashing for Android users, but Google has fixed it. The issue was due to a system component &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview"&gt;called Android System WebView&lt;/a&gt; that lets Android apps display web content. Google now has a fix that requires users to update &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview"&gt;Android System WebView&lt;/a&gt; to version 89.0.4389.105 and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; to the latest version. Both are available on Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ih2wyx"&gt;The issues began on Monday afternoon and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;iid=aa75515d184a2423be444d676b7ebf45"&gt;lasted about seven hours&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Google Workspace dashboard for Gmail. The company recommended using the desktop interface until issues were resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFeGT6"&gt;“We are aware of an issue with WebView causing some apps on Android to crash for some users,” Google said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are currently working to fully validate the scope and a fix is in progress.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUFqjV"&gt;Some users said that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/19Watty87/status/1374130850518945798"&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt; the latest update to WebView fixed the issue — and in fact, Samsung’s official US support Twitter account recommended &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milanbear0609/status/1374122986870083584"&gt;taking that exact step&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iki3I2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hi! Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Please remove the Webview Update and then restart the phone. Here are the steps: Go settings &amp;gt; apps &amp;gt; tap the three dots in the top right corner &amp;gt; show system apps &amp;gt; search for Android System WebView &amp;gt; select Uninstall updates. ^Nina&lt;/p&gt;— Samsung Support US (@SamsungSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungSupport/status/1374124081843343361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knhlsV"&gt;The dashboard currently shows all services operating without problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE1kVw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 22nd, 10:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Google. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZyrd0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 23rd, 4:16AM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added links to updated WebView and Chrome browser that solve the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OLED Nintendo Switch reportedly uses new Nvidia chip with DLSS support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qnjcgn298Se-wxM6Pgv9dFSGmzs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69010330/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_zelda.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8hf0zX"&gt;The next Nintendo Switch will use a new Nvidia system-on-chip with support for DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade"&gt;report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The chip is said to bring improvements to GPU and CPU performance, with DLSS serving as Nintendo’s solution for displaying higher resolution images on 4K TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4II0W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17854230/nvidia-rtx-2080-turing-architecture-specs-platform"&gt;DLSS was introduced with Nvidia’s RTX 20-series GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, based on the Turing architecture. It makes use of neural networks to reconstruct game images in real time at a higher quality. Different versions of the technology have variously relied on the GPU’s tensor cores and training the AI on specific games, but the upshot is that you can render a game at a lower traditional resolution and get a much higher output with minimal performance penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iVfyK0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia rethinks the graphics card with the RTX 2080","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17854230/nvidia-rtx-2080-turing-architecture-specs-platform"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YhQbal"&gt;That theoretically makes it a good fit for the Switch, which often struggles to hit its own native resolutions of 720p in handheld mode or 1080p on a TV screen. It’s also not surprising to hear that the new Switch would require an all-new chip design from Nvidia; the original Switch used a Tegra X1, which was announced in 2015 before Nvidia stopped producing general-purpose mobile SoCs. With the Switch’s success, though, it’s undoubtedly worth Nvidia’s while to deliver a new custom design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7adIO"&gt;Bloomberg has already reported that the new Switch will have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;7-inch OLED screen&lt;/a&gt;. Today’s report says the device is planned for this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft in talks with Discord over $10 billion-plus acquisition: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZNR4wwhOyORCiVWh4RuX2LLsqI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009745/acastro_210129_1777_discord_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wQ2En4"&gt;Microsoft is in discussions with Discord to acquire the gaming-focused chat software for more than $10 billion, according to sources &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/microsoft-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-more-than-10b"&gt;talking to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. Xbox chief Phil Spencer is said to be talking to Discord about the potential deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oznICi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/22/discord-exploring-sale-that-could-be-worth-more-than-10-billion/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier today that Discord was exploring a $10 billion-plus sale after multiple potential buyers expressed interest, and that it had signed an exclusive acquisition discussion with one party, suggesting a deal could be close. Bloomberg’s sources say the deal isn’t imminent, however, with one person saying Discord would be more likely to take itself public than seek an acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4AEGn"&gt;Bloomberg names Epic Games and Amazon as companies that have also held discussions with Discord in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aACbSr"&gt;Discord has about 140 million monthly users and made $130 million in revenue last year, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; recently &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, though the company isn’t yet profitable. Its last valuation was $7 billion after a funding round in December generated $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkdllz"&gt;Discord’s software is free for most users, but the company makes money through $9.99 monthly Nitro subscriptions that offer more advanced features like higher resolution screensharing, extra sticker packs, and larger upload limits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now tell the FCC just how broken the internet is for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mp-CIRTBZE5yPDn1aImJRYi78o=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009435/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8BoOq"&gt;It’s not at all controversial to say that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;internet service sucks in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. As part of its plan to update coverage maps in the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in a break from tradition, is finally asking average Americans &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData/consumers"&gt;to report which internet services are &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; where they live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsoJRq"&gt;In the past, the FCC has made these coverage maps&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt; with self-reported data&lt;/a&gt; from the ISPs themselves, an inherently compromising decision because internet service providers will naturally want to paint the rosiest picture possible. Since the FCC uses these maps as evidence for proposed regulation, it can seriously hinder the FCC’s ability to make sure there’s actual competition in the market and that the internet is being responsibly distributed. For instance, a map might show that you have 11 broadband providers when you actually only have one or two real options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qrWrkY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Take note. We're going straight to consumers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bZzsFo46ap"&gt;https://t.co/bZzsFo46ap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1374093168816369672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0DXp9"&gt;Now, the FCC will finally go to the people actually using the internet to learn what’s up, though you may need to communicate clearly to be heard. &lt;a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001440131"&gt;The form the FCC is using for your responses&lt;/a&gt; is decidedly rudimentary; it looks like a general complaint form, and doesn’t ask any specific questions about broadband at all (the only reference is in the header). But the FCC says it’s a stopgap on the path to a more detailed and specific reporting tool. For now, perhaps you can take a look at &lt;a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/"&gt;the FCC’s current crappy maps at your address&lt;/a&gt;, and tell the FCC whether you actually have the kinds of choices that the ISPs claim you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbwtmn"&gt;Hopefully, once the Broadband Data Task Force finishes collecting these new data points, we’ll have more accurate maps that show the worrying reality of American internet, and be able to do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mP2nyt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Steam can now stream games at 8K resolution and we immediately thought of you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nhk super hi-vision hero" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpl0zNa9UbcVugLsqLwdNRWVibo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009321/DSC01926.1419978978.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early 8K TV set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2H4Mdk"&gt;I just realized: I never came back to thank you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/27/21723138/samsung-98-inch-tv-deal-sale-black-friday-8k"&gt;for buying that $30,000 8K television&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, I’m sure the $1,500 coupon helped? But I feel like I still owe you a bit more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vfawb"&gt;How about this: why not be the first to stream PC games at 8K resolution to the other end of your mansion? When we saw that Steam &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/steam/?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;amp;emgid=3006688962897471639"&gt;now supports that feature&lt;/a&gt;, we immediately thought of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISnlQW"&gt;Imagine the possibilities: you could sit down on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170575/kohler-konnect-bathroom-smart-gadgets-numi-intelligent-toilet-ces-2019"&gt;your fully immersive $9,000 toilet&lt;/a&gt; with your backup 8K TV — as you do — and instead wasting so many of those glorious pixels on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;a pillarboxed Snyder Cut&lt;/a&gt;, you can use all 33+ million of them to sling some not-terribly-demanding game at 8K resolution from your blinding rainbow death box of an RTX 3090-equipped gaming PC, without even disturbing its sanctum at the other end of your house!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHxo2W"&gt;You’ll likely &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; that level of PC, of course, and even then 8K may not be a given. “Results may very depending on hardware,” reads Valve’s release notes. I would also suggest a wired Ethernet cable to reduce latency, and you might want to unlock your bandwidth limiter in Steam &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Remote Play &amp;gt; Advanced Client Options too — because 50Mbps may not cut it at 8K resolution. You’d know better than us, though.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWrIqVt4BYr5Lk5vSPqmIGkFqxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390373/image__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;8K Remote Play is now available in the stable Steam client, after coming to the beta a few days ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4cRpbr"&gt;In all seriousness, it’s pretty cool to see Steam getting prepped for the TVs of the future. And please send us a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;high resolution photo of your setup if it’s your TV of now, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1zFb5"&gt;On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who can’t afford new games much less an 8K TV or high-end gaming PC, Valve has good news for you as well — the company just brought Steam Remote Play Together URL sharing out of beta, so friends can send you a link to join their local multiplayer games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300768/steam-remote-play-together-no-account-required-beta"&gt;even if you don’t have a PC or a Steam account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
