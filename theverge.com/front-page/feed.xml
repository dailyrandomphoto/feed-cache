    <title>EV startup Bollinger ‘indefinitely’ delays its rugged electric trucks to focus on delivery vans</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uWueQJ"&gt;Bollinger, a Michigan-based startup, announced today that it was postponing its plans to manufacture electric trucks in order to focus on commercial delivery vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHTM0W"&gt;Bollinger burst onto the scene several years ago with a pair of rugged, box-like electric truck prototypes: the four-door B1 (which is shaped like a Jeep Wrangler) and the B2 (which is longer and has a pickup bed). It’s the latest EV startup to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846960/electric-vehicles-car-companies-promises-ship-dates"&gt;run into speed bumps&lt;/a&gt; as it attempts to build a complicated vehicle manufacturing business from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqOKC0"&gt;Bollinger has already delayed both vehicles, so their postponement may not come as a huge shock to close watchers. The trucks were originally scheduled to go into production in 2020, but that date was moved to late 2021, with the expectation of making several thousand by early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KaPKLZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the latest EV startup to run into speed bumps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fv07gp"&gt;Now, the vehicles will be “postponed indefinitely” as the company shifts focus to an electric delivery van, Bollinger CEO Robert Bollinger said in a statement. The company will refund deposits for those customers who previously put money down to reserve the B1 and B2 trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1R98r"&gt;“The B1 and B2 are postponed indefinitely, in order to concentrate on commercial development,” he said. “As these trucks are dear to my heart, I’d never say never. If our continued development in commercial allows us to someday return, there’d be no one happier than me. But there’s no timeline for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Xd9sL"&gt;The Deliver-E electric van, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405451/bollinger-electric-delivery-van-production-price-specs"&gt;which was announced in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is slated to be built on a variable vehicle platform that allows for multiple battery sizes, such as 70 kWh, 105 kWh, 140 kWh, 175 kWh, and 210 kWh. This will mean customers will have a variety of range options, prices, and wheelbase sizes to choose from. The front-wheel-drive platform will be engineered to fit Classes 2B, 3, 4, and 5. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyTeWj0lW4skUtIodMh9aH-HoSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166646/Bollinger_Motors_Electric_Platform_front_3.4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcPd7L"&gt;Bollinger declined to affirm a starting date for the van’s production, noting that the company is still on the hunt for a manufacturing partner. “The Deliver-E van was our interpretation of the kind of body that could be put on our electric platforms,” he said. “We never intended on building that body ourselves, but we are in talks with upfitter partners now that manufacture truck and van bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ex7YD"&gt;If it eventually graduates from concept to production, the Deliver-E will have a lot of competition. General Motors is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867087/walmart-brightdrop-electric-delivery-van-gm-fedex"&gt;shipping electric vans&lt;/a&gt; under its BrightDrop brand to customers like FedEx and Walmart. Mercedes-Benz has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173373/mercedes-benz-evito-electric-van-specs-photos"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251084/mercedes-benz-eqv-electric-van-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; on the road, and Ford plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;go into production&lt;/a&gt; this year on its electrified E-Transit van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpCx9Y"&gt;Amazon, which has a fleet of tens of thousands of combustion-engine vans making up its massive delivery operation, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;ordered 100,000 electric vans from EV startup Rivian&lt;/a&gt; (which it is also heavily invested in) and is planning on buying EVs from Stellantis as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Build a speedy USB-C drive with this discounted M.2 SSD enclosure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pxCGRUJ1PYdB4bbdpmDEhxoNIX0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70387892/akrales_190430_3393_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve got yourself a small weekend project.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2O9Pp"&gt;In most cases, people purchase M.2 NVMe drives to stick into their desktop PCs or laptops for more of that good, fast storage. But there are some other, more practical applications that don’t require opening up your hardware. You can get one of these fast SSDs, then stick it into a small enclosure, and suddenly you’ve made yourself a convenient and speedy portable USB-C drive that’ll cost you as little as $93 with today’s deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHLnR9"&gt;If that sounds like something you’d like to add to your tech repertoire, Sabrent’s tool-free USB-C Gen 3.2 enclosure &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RVC6F9Y?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to just $22.94&lt;/a&gt; (usually $40) at Amazon. Adding an M.2 drive to it is simple, just pop the top off and follow the instructions for carefully guiding the drive into the slot. Then, you fasten it into place to keep it from moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HmXvr7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10977806"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J6H4W0"&gt;(Note: the M.2 SSD enclosure featured in the lead image above is available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Tool-free-Enclosure-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B07N48N5GR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here at Amazon for $40&lt;/a&gt;, down from its normal $50 price.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbOEj"&gt;You can stick a SATA or NVMe (the latter being much faster) SSD in this enclosure, and it supports up to the 2280 form factor, which is the most popular size (it can house 2242- and 2260-sized M.2 drives, alternatively). Its USB 3.2 support allows for up to 10Gbps transfer speeds, though its speed will ultimately be determined by what kind of drive you stick inside of it. An affordable and relatively speedy option to put inside of this enclosure also comes from Sabrent. Its 1TB Rocket Q SSD costs $89.99 right now (usually $111) at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S0jH4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10977796" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Samsung 980" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YlcfbsH-cdg4lFx9HkgyMn7QpUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339485/samsung980hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hLb4jW"&gt;If you are hoping to get a Samsung SSD within this price range, its 1TB 980 NVMe SSD is $109.99 — down from $139.99 — at Best Buy. This model should be sufficient for a lot of people’s needs, though it’s not the fastest NVMe drive out there, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22307402/samsung-980-nvme-ssd-dram-pcie-3-speed-price"&gt;as it lacks DRAM&lt;/a&gt;, which is relied upon by your PC to map the contents within the drive to make it faster at serving up your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FS88as"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10977801" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NaOwH5"&gt;For a slightly speedier Samsung SSD that does feature DRAM, check out its 970 Evo Plus with 500GB of storage that costs $69.99 at Best Buy, down from its usual price of $95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vD3Wdj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9567584" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T3GBzg"&gt;For something completely different, check out Amazon’s stellar sale price on the latest (third-gen) AirPods. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;They’re back down to $139.99&lt;/a&gt; (originally $179), matching the great price that was popular with readers during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. For those not in the know, these retain a similar design to the AirPods Pro but have some key differences. Notably, they don’t have silicon ear tips for a better fit, nor do they support active noise cancellation. Though, while similar to the original AirPods in terms of how they fit in the ear canal, our review Chris Welch says that Apple amped up the sound quality in this generation, among other new additions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ooypnS"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable way to add some ambient lighting around your TV that changes color in response to what’s happening on the display, check out this deal at Amazon. Govee’s Immersion backlights that support TVs between 55 and 65 inches are $63.09 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;when you check the coupon box on this page&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, this product costs $83.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QV3716"&gt;The Immersion kit includes a long LED light strip that goes behind your TV, along with a camera that needs to be mounted atop your TV (this is how its lights can match what is showing on your TV). The lights can be controlled through Govee’s app or via your voice with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="xPkQnI"&gt;We recently covered this Amazon deal on Elgato’s Cam Link 4K, which makes it easier to link up your DSLR or mirrorless camera to a PC and supports up to 4K resolution playback at 30 frames per second (or 1080p / 60fps). Normally $129.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-Camcorder/dp/B07K3FN5MR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-Camcorder/dp/B07K3FN5MR?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$106.49. &lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV sales to resume January 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8pU0fSd8i7J2wQYoBcBdaebKYk=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70387794/2022_01_12_16_44_38_Greenshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1ilOEy"&gt;Your case of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; FOMO is nearing its end. Last night, game director Naoki Yoshida wrote on the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; website that Square Enix &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9a6bed5c06ae511c363ece5ead0a98a3986554a2"&gt;will resume digital sales&lt;/a&gt; of the popular MMO on January 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoYJLT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; grew so popular with the launch of its latest expansion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877031/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-square-enix-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the queues to log into game servers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822793/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-early-access-server-queues"&gt;thousands of people long and took hours to get through&lt;/a&gt;. Servers were so congested that in December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839415/final-fantasy-14-sales-suspended-servers-over-capacity-digital-physical"&gt;Square Enix suspended the sale of digital versions of the game&lt;/a&gt;. As more players progress through the content, levels of server congestion are finally starting to even out, permitting sales of the game to resume. Yoshida also acknowledged that &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg"&gt;meme-able free trial&lt;/a&gt; offering will remain unavailable for now but will return in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHXwYA"&gt;Yoshida’s update also included information about the addition of a new Oceanian data center which will give Australian and New Zealand players, who traditionally played on Japanese servers or suffered high ping to connect to American ones, more choices on where to play. In his announcement, Yoshida said the new data center will go live January 25th, and to encourage players to move there, Square Enix will waive the typical $18 world transfer fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A2CN7"&gt;In addition to a new data center, existing ones in Europe, Japan, and North America are getting expansions. Previously, Square Enix cited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822825/final-fantasy-xiv-14-endwalker-global-chip-shortage-server-queue"&gt;the global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; as the reason they could not deploy more servers to assist with congestion. Yesterday’s announcement included a roadmap for when these expansions are to take place with the first phase beginning in summer of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s87iuv"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DQ2fT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TMySx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PARbZt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How God of War’s impressive PC port came to life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mPd8uBTR14dqz6vLOsF6tSMwpEo=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70387599/Announce_Screenshot_05_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Mouse and keyboard, meet boy and Kratos&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4Sxtsh"&gt;Lately Sony has been increasingly open to putting previously PlayStation-exclusive games on PC, and today’s release of &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is the most notable yet. One of Sony’s premier franchises since the original game was released for the PS2 in 2005, all subsequent titles — a 2007 spinoff for mobile phones aside — have been locked to PlayStation hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17223854/god-of-war-review-ps4"&gt;Santa Monica Studio’s 2018 &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most acclaimed games for the PS4, and now it’s available to a new audience for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq1rx1"&gt;I’ve spent some time with the PC version and found it to be impressively well-tailored to the platform, which is not always a given. I spoke with Santa Monica’s senior manager of technical production Matt DeWald and lead UX designer and accessibility lead Mila Pavlin to find out more about the process of bringing &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; to PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gqTm4"&gt;“It was about two years ago that we decided to look into whether it was possible,” DeWald says. “So the idea came down of like, Okay, let’s let’s think about whether we could do a PC [port] — we have a custom engine, we haven’t actually released a PC game, let’s get it up and running and just see what are the issues that we’re going to have and how much work is this going to actually take.” Santa Monica tasked Jetpack Interactive, a studio in Vancouver that had already been working on other internal collaborations, with figuring out the scope of the project, and ultimately it got approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZNtm6"&gt;“They’re integrated into the team, so they’re not really a typical port house where we offload something and throw it over the fence,” DeWald says of Jetpack. “They’re working out of our code bases, they’re on our Teams channels and they’re communicating with our team, they’re part of our standups.” Four engineers at Jetpack handled primary development of the port, with DeWald serving as producer and other Santa Monica members like Pavlin making additional contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="g5Z9zW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9wM2Zdeloc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHvxlu"&gt;“[PC players] want it to feel like it was built for the PC rather than being a port,” says Pavlin, who worked on the project’s UX and controls. “So a lot of the work that we did early on was about hitting those points on the graphic quality, making sure that the graphics quality were up to standards and that it was responsive on the PC platform and then making sure that the controls were customizable and felt good in the native configuration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3ubL0"&gt;I can’t speak to how &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; will run on everyone’s PC, of course — and as a hypothetical, DeWald wouldn’t be drawn on how it’ll perform on the Steam Deck — but my experience with the game on a five-year-old machine has been positive. There are a lot of graphical options and performance has been more or less in line with what I’d expect; I average about 50 frames per second on a 1440p ultrawide monitor with G-Sync, and that’s using a Skylake Core i5 processor and a GTX 1080 with a mixture of settings. Each visual option can be run in “original” mode, which basically gives you PS4-level quality, and you can crank them up or down from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="N3s45g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[PC players] want it to feel like it was built for the PC rather than being a port.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xaAeKs"&gt;While you might not immediately think of it as a good fit given its heritage as a console-based action game, &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; on PC can be played with mouse and keyboard controls, and the scheme is surprisingly well thought out. Actions like aiming and throwing Kratos’ axe, for example, feel more natural if you’re used to playing FPS games with a mouse. Pavlin points out that the commands aren’t mapped one to one from the list of controller actions — for example, on the PS4 you jump with the same context-sensitive button that’s used to interact with the environment, but on PC the jump command is handled separately by the space bar, like most other PC games. There are also options like auto-sprint, which can be more comfortable for many players. Personally, I would still lean toward using a controller, but I’ve finished the game on the PS4 so I’m already used to it. For newcomers who only play on PC, the mouse and keyboard scheme is a thoughtful addition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vNBPm"&gt;“I found it very comfortable to use because I’m used to that from my other games — I play a lot of PC games,” Pavlin says. “It feels like a very native and fun way to play the game. It kind of changes up the whole way that you approach combat. I found that I was able to target very easily using the mouse because the precision was so good that I was able to do things like get headshots and make sure that I’m, you know, knocking out the legs of the dragon and doing those precision shots that maybe with a controller I would find a little bit more difficult or have to use an aim assist for. So I do think that there’s advantages to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIwaO7"&gt;Another strong addition to the PC version is support for 21:9 ultrawide monitors (as well as the taller 16:10). This is more interesting for &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; than it might be for other titles because of the game’s signature one-shot technique, where the camera essentially never cuts from the beginning to the end of the game. I wondered whether expanding the field of view presented any challenges in terms of revealing things that maybe weren’t intended to be on-screen originally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3sAoQ0"&gt;“[The ultrawide support] revealed all the little hacks and cheats we were using to kind of move people into position or have somebody come on from off-screen,” DeWald says. “They might not be fully animated. So that was a manual process that required just kind of going through the entire game.” Cutscenes, too, sometimes had to be reframed to better fit the expanded content that’s being rendered by the engine in real time. The results are impressive — I never felt like anything looked out of place, and Kratos’ AI-controlled son Atreus follows along with you just as convincingly as he did on a 16:9 TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvdlod"&gt;Unfortunately, though, you’ll need to run the game at ultrawide resolution if you want a wider field of view, because there isn’t a conventional FoV slider. DeWald says it introduced bugs that the team didn’t have time to fix, with the game basing certain logic on what’s on- or off-screen at a given moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M1v_6azjWFFgar-YWriP16DtquI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168563/Announce_Screenshot_08_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hxMCoP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t originally designed as a PC game, and the experience of going back and making it feel native to a platform has prompted Santa Monica Studio to reexamine its workflow. “Moving into the PC space really got us to think, not just about PC releases, but also our entire pipeline,” Pavlin says. “So looking at how we make things more adjustable and customizable from the get-go with the way that we’re building our code base and our assets. If we know that we’re going to have a large range of formats that we’re going to move into or we know that we’re going to need to have control customization, the programmers actually need to know that very early on in a project so that they can build the code base in a way that’s more flexible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeBgwq"&gt;That will also allow Santa Monica Studio to help make its games more accessible, with Pavlin citing the example of how the way &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; was initially only designed with hard-coded PS4 controls in mind caused a lot of work for the team to rethink its inputs on PC. “This is very important not just for PC ports, but also you’re moving forward with accessibility and making sure that you are supporting additional control functions, controller customization, or keyboard customization. And in future projects, we’ve learned those key lessons here that we can take into actually designing our games better for them to be more flexible for the future, to make it easier on everyone going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Atqsd3"&gt;Santa Monica Studio is currently developing &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s sequel, &lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, which is set to be released on the PS4 and PS5 this year. There’s no word on whether it’ll ever make it to the PC, but Pavlin’s comments suggest that &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s PC port could have a positive impact on even the console versions of &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;. For now, it’s simply the best way to play the game and well worth checking out whether you’re a new or returning player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZGZHH"&gt;&lt;small&gt;God of War &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out on Steam and the Epic Games Store today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates’ climate fund looks to funnel billions into carbon removal, green hydrogen, and more </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KexSfk"&gt;Bill Gates’ climate investment fund is moving forward with plans to funnel billions of dollars into emerging green technologies. This week, the fund, Breakthrough Energy, put out a Request for Proposals for projects in &lt;a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/articles/announcing-catalyst-eu-rfp"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; through Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program. It comes after the Catalyst program released its first RFP for similar projects in &lt;a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/articles/announcing-catalyst-rfp"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByXa6K"&gt;The Catalyst program, launched last June with the aim of enabling&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a zero-carbon economy through public-private partnerships&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;says it has fundraised $1.5 billion over the past six months and hopes to raise $3 billion by the middle of next year. It plans to use that money to boost four different kinds of technologies: green hydrogen fuels, sustainable aviation fuels, energy storage, and tech that captures carbon dioxide in the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2v6O8"&gt;Back in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621636/bill-gates-fund-climate-change-tech"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;, Gates said that the Catalyst program would funnel $1.5 billion over three years into joint projects with the US Department of Energy if Congress passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill. That public-private partnership could trigger&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;up to $15 billion in investments in the US, Catalyst &lt;a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/articles/doe-partnership-announcement"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z5ICtS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We feel very confident the the US has projects that would represent more than a billion and a half dollars of investment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yO95hN"&gt;Biden signed that bill into &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; in November, unlocking $1.2 trillion in investments — including tens of billions of dollars to promote electric vehicles, update airports, makeover the power grid, build out “&lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/FECM%20Infrastructure%20Factsheet.pdf"&gt;hubs&lt;/a&gt;” for clean hydrogen, and direct air capture and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=justine+calma+pipelines+co2&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS895US895&amp;amp;oq=justine+calma+pipelines+co2&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.3928j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;pipelines for captured carbon&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99py5M"&gt;Now, Breakthrough Energy Catalyst says it’s poised to follow through on its funding pledge. The amount it ultimately gives, however, will depend on how promising the projects are. It plans to dole out funds for the first group of technologies over the next five years or so. “We feel very confident that the US has projects that would represent more than a billion and a half dollars of investment from Catalyst, but I don’t want to say they definitely will until we start evaluating those,” Breakthrough Energy managing director Jonah Goldman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re not going to just give a billion and a half — these are serious, rigorous project evaluation processes that have to go on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DaZIn"&gt;The projects that Catalyst ultimately selects in Europe might also be eligible for additional funds from the European Commission and European Investment Bank. Altogether, Breakthrough Energy hopes that the public-private partnership can mobilize $1 billion USD for European projects between 2022 and 2027. The fund also has plans to release an RFP for the UK this year, followed by funding opportunities for other parts of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUXBlx"&gt;“Critical for all these climate technologies is to get the costs down and to be able to scale them up to a pretty gigantic level,” Gates told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-pledges-1-5-billion-for-infrastructure-bills-new-climate-projects-11628769601?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/Dfa8tXxdVM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APEhNR"&gt;Technology that removes CO2 from the air, called direct air capture, is a potent example of how much investment is needed. Today, this technology is in a very early stage and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;very expensive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Microsoft, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;pledged in 2020 &lt;/a&gt;to reduce and draw down more carbon dioxide than the company emits by the end of the decade, might have faced a bill of $9.6 billion to remove the company’s 2020 emissions. To help bring costs down and make good on its commitment, Microsoft also launched a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund. But far more investment will be needed for the tech to become cheap and widely available.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The other technologies that Gates’ Catalyst Program focuses on will similarly need a lot of help to get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey’s Block is working to decentralize Bitcoin mining</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bitcoin Conference Draws Cryptocurrency Fans To Miami" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBtxAbmqdGMjG78Cul5Dk2dPqF8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70387359/1321753348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JflC7D"&gt;Block, the payment company formerly known as Square, is working on building an “open Bitcoin mining system,” its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1481745463401500676"&gt;CEO Jack Dorsey has announced&lt;/a&gt;. In a thread, Block’s general manager for hardware &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TempletonThomas/status/1481728144071561221"&gt;Thomas Templeton outlined&lt;/a&gt; the company’s goals for the system, which is for it to be easily available, reliable, performant, and relatively power efficient compared to its hashrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZPgPO"&gt;The overall aim is to make mining more decentralized, in turn making the overall Bitcoin network more resilient. As the cryptocurrency’s value has increased, and it’s become more challenging to mine without economies of scale, there have been fears that the network has become &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-31/bitcoin-s-network-operations-are-controlled-by-five-companies?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;centralized on too small a group of miners&lt;/a&gt;. Making mining more decentralized is “a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TempletonThomas/status/1481728134001033217"&gt;Templeton says&lt;/a&gt;. But the plans could be controversial given &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwin-6uTqbH1AhWilFwKHaEpBDYQFnoECAoQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2021%2F09%2F03%2Fclimate%2Fbitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1Cqd9-TaGQ4SKrj6VzzHCj"&gt;how energy intensive&lt;/a&gt; mining Bitcoin tends to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wP3dSy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We want to make mining more distributed and efficient in every way, from buying, to set up, to maintenance, to mining. We’re interested because mining goes far beyond creating new bitcoin. We see it as a long-term need for a future that is fully decentralized and permissionless.&lt;/p&gt;— Thomas Templeton (@TempletonThomas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TempletonThomas/status/1481728134001033217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1tx2Y4"&gt;According to Templeton, Block is open to building its own ASIC (a custom chip optimized for a single purpose — in this case mining Bitcoin), but that the team will also include software designers. The aim is to build a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TempletonThomas/status/1481728144071561221"&gt;high performance integrated system that’s also open-source&lt;/a&gt;. Dorsey has previously said he wants Bitcoin mining to be “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1449110250058096640"&gt;as easy as plugging a rig into a power source&lt;/a&gt;,” and that he sees value in a mining system that’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1449110247776342018"&gt;vertically integrated&lt;/a&gt; across hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y9slK"&gt;As well as its mining system, in July last year Block (then Square) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569309/square-hardware-wallet-bitcoin-jack-dorsey"&gt;announced it was building a Bitcoin hardware wallet&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of making “Bitcoin custody more mainstream.” Square also previously allowed its customers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17689156/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-support-to-all-50-us-states"&gt;buy and sell Bitcoin using its Cash App&lt;/a&gt;. Dorsey has long been an avid supporter of Bitcoin, and his Twitter bio continues to simply be “#Bitcoin.” He earlier talked about his desire for Block to build a Bitcoin mining system &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1449110239442345995"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to send private messages and make calls in Slack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jwXQSQJmK1BADU798hIWsGVBFls=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70387320/VRG_ILL_4947_slack_direct_messaging.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PXokpS"&gt;While Slack began as a workplace instant-messaging tool, over the last few years it has become popular as a way for anyone to keep in contact with a group of friends, colleagues, or family. It now even offers a way for groups to create in-the-moment “huddles,” in which two or more people can move from text to audio — if you’re on a paid plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvHAGv"&gt;Although Slack is largely intended for group collaboration, it also has tools if you just want to chat one-on-one with somebody. Here, we’re going to go over some of the ways you can have a private text, audio, or video conversation with one other person via the free version of Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uTAPN1"&gt;Text conversations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="en10aa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the Slack desktop app:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="apZXlK"&gt;If you’ve recently sent a personal message to someone, you’ll find their name in the left-hand sidebar under “Direct messages.” Click on their name, type your message in the box at the bottom and press enter / return to send. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N47P5x"&gt;If the name is not in the sidebar, click the + next to “Direct messages.” Type in the name of the person you want to send a message to. As you type, the person’s name will come up in the results (assuming they’re in that Slack workspace) and you can click on it. Type your message in the box at the bottom and press enter / return to send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ed6eIf"&gt;You can also start a message by clicking the pencil icon in the top left corner of the screen next to your workspace and username. Enter the name of the person you want to message in the bar at the top. Write the message in the box at the bottom of the screen and press enter or return to send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To start a one-to-one conversation, click on the pencil icon at the top of the left column." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wzIxvKPPBUaT74cVewYc3U46gFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19855348/Screen_Shot_2020_03_27_at_5.22.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To start a one-to-one conversation, click on the pencil icon at the top of the left column.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A8kZvz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the mobile app:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6UO3k"&gt;If you want to continue a previous conversation, or find someone you’ve already conversed with, tap on “DMs” on the bottom of the screen to find a history of your direct messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G1Mtl"&gt;You can also tap the pencil symbol at the bottom of the Home screen. This will bring up the “New Message” screen with a list of people you’ve previously messaged with; either select one of those, or type in the name of a person you want to send a direct message to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EIgcsk"&gt;Voice conversations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UBOYqh"&gt;Slack also has a built-in calling feature. &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115003205446-Slack-plans-and-features-"&gt;On the free version&lt;/a&gt;, you can do voice and video calls, but only with one other person. If you have a subscription to one of Slack’s paid plans, you can also do group calls with &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack"&gt;up to 15 people&lt;/a&gt; and share your screen on a video call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLqx4S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the Slack desktop app:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YatCDm"&gt;Open up a direct message or a channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oCGc5E"&gt;In the top right corner, click on the phone icon&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AvGDWS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a mobile app:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="L01b6G"&gt;Begin a direct message with the person you want to converse with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zwd1cY"&gt;If you’re using an Android device, tap on the information icon on the upper right. If you’re using an iPhone, tap on the person’s name at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gf6z0q"&gt;Tap the call icon to start a call (the person will get a notification that somebody is trying to call them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRAhdy"&gt;If you want to make it a video call, tap the camera icon&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tNRWYB"&gt;Huddles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="f1sqqq"&gt;Last spring, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556992/slack-huddles-audio-calls-feature-launch-discord-like"&gt;Slack introduced Huddles&lt;/a&gt;, which are meant to be audio conversations that you can immediately jump into during a text conversation with one or more people (as opposed to the audio calls, which are just a bit more formal). Unfortunately, they are only available if you have a paid account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed1Gji"&gt;If you do, it’s very simple to start a Huddle. (Note: you can create a Huddle with a single person, a group of people, or a channel; for this particular article, we’ll concentrate on one-to-one conversations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hy0vAf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the desktop app:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FovudS"&gt;Make sure you’re in a text conversation with the person you want to huddle with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tWE1vp"&gt;At the bottom of the left column, there will be the Huddle icon on the left of the person’s name (it will look like a broadcasting mic) and a toggle on the right. Use that to toggle the Huddle feature on, and you should immediately be able to converse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the Huddle icon for instant audio conversation." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IbzmZsMsboTY-kpUvgd117wB-6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144833/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_11.16.57_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the Huddle icon for instant audio conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f5OoqK"&gt;If you’re using the desktop app, you can add running captions during a Huddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wE91UN"&gt;While you’re talking, just above the Huddle icon, you will see text telling you who is speaking, and beneath that, text saying how many people are in the Huddle. Click on that second line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UMOJpk"&gt;A pop-up will show you who is in the Huddle; the person speaking will be highlighted. Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tape on the lines above the icons to bring up a pop-up." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_zfPdhRxefaOhh0gHslW_RVfcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144836/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_11.18.37_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the lines above the icons to bring up a pop-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="r2G9vh"&gt;Click on “Turn on captions”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tape on the three dots, and “Turn on captions.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vnLsoHWKYcOB-Rb2cNWu4SM9Vk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144838/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_11.18.52_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the three dots, and “Turn on captions”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="P6Mjet"&gt;You’ll get a larger pop-up box that will show captions for the conversation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you have captions for your audio conversation." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlb6fWAwWGkLg-dtFvjEv_5Dv0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144844/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_11.19.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you have captions for your audio conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YAvi0C"&gt;While there was an occasional hiccup when two people spoke simultaneously, we found the captions were largely accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hc6fj6"&gt;Finally, you can share your screen during a Huddle by clicking on the monitor icon to the left of the toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXlhCj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the mobile app:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tI3TMx"&gt;Make sure you’re in a text conversation with the person you want to Huddle with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SHwyBP"&gt;Tap on the Huddle icon on the top line, to the right of the person’s name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXjpugLeKQSh8YPMCJPOj83aUn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144851/IMG_0CF5CE834466_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also Huddle using Slack’s mobile app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The mobile app doesn’t yet have sharing or captioning." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbUrP6l9WvpKCnYfXZ2XeJAivnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144852/IMG_4AC902E28F06_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mobile app doesn’t yet have sharing or captioning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gfSSw"&gt;And that’s it! Unfortunately, the captioning and screen-share features are not available on the mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0Ry51"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrSl6X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQhd2Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Aeny"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin Vivomove Sport review: the right mix of form and function</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, a Garmin hybrid that checks off all the boxes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6XM6ED"&gt;In theory, hybrid smartwatches should offer the best of analog design and modern technology — something sleek and beautiful on the wrist but capable of discreetly tracking your health and delivering notifications. In practice, companies tend to put a premium on that chic design, leaving you with a smartwatch that’s not as functional as others in its price range. But Garmin’s entry-level Vivomove Sport is affordable at $179.99, with a design and feature set that matches the price. Finally, it feels like we’re getting somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mclypo"&gt;The Vivomove Sport was just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches"&gt;introduced at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s Garmin’s first new hybrid since it launched the Vivomove Luxe, Style, and 3 / 3S back in 2019. At a glance, the Sport looks like a Swatch. (Actually, my mint green review unit looks &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;a href="https://www.swatch.com/en-us/fairy-frosty-ll123/LL123.html"&gt;this particular Swatch&lt;/a&gt;.) However, a flick of the wrist or a double-tap to the display will reveal your stats, notifications, timers, and other widgets for Garmin-specific fitness features. The display reminds me a lot of what AR glasses try to do — project a ghostly, holographic-like information overlay on an otherwise ordinary object. It’s a neat effect, and it’s easier to see your data and notifications compared to the last hybrid I tested, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;Withings ScanWatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCWIH9"&gt;Of course, hybrid displays come with limitations. The Sport is good if you want to stay in the loop without major distractions. You can’t really read full messages in the bottom half of the screen — but you can easily see who or what app is trying to reach you. However, this is the sort of watch that tells you when to look at your phone. It’s not the kind that lets you leave it at home. There are no contactless payments, it opts for tethered GPS, and there’s no speaker or microphone for you to take calls via the wrist. (Android owners can use quick replies to texts and reject phone calls with text.) You can, however, set timers, start breathing sessions, log hydration, and view health metrics like heart rate and stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q74Ybj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10976670"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="weGp1x"&gt;To move between menus, you just swipe left and right. To select, you tap once. To go back to the previous menu, you just tap the tiny arrow that pops up. By default, a long press acts as a shortcut to the workout app for easy recording. Is the navigation a little clunky? Yes. But this is true for every hybrid watch I’ve ever tested. Garmin’s menu navigation is at least better than the one Fossil uses for its e-ink hybrids. The only time it really failed me was when I had sweaty fingers after a workout — but then again, this is why a lot of athletes are pro-physical buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QS5Cr8"&gt;Functionally, you can get pretty close to a hands-off experience. Garmin says it has an estimated five days of battery life — I got closer to 3–4 with frequent GPS activities. That’s good as far as smartwatches go but on the shorter side for a hybrid. That said, you don’t have to sync every day if you don’t want to. It stores up to 10 timed activities and 14 days’ worth of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nG7fvH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Basically this is a no-frills tracker in a smartwatch’s body&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0y1Q24"&gt;Basically, this is a no-frills fitness tracker in a smartwatch’s body. What sets this particular one apart is its design is both cute and functional, and the available options are versatile for multiple aesthetics. As much as I dig the Fitbit Luxe’s bougie divorcee energy, it sometimes looks too much like a tracker for dressier occasions. I’d have to get another strap to fix that. I wouldn’t have to with something like the Sport. It’s also a comfortable tracker. The 40mm case is smaller than the vast majority of wristables on the market, and it doesn’t overpower my tiny bird wrists. It doesn’t get caught on jacket sleeves, I don’t have to worry about the silicone straps getting groady after a workout, and it’s very lightweight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nftwUDOcInF6oGnIY6znOZ3FB74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162060/vsong_220110_4962_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hidden OLED is discreet and good enough to let you know when you should check your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aEV1pi"&gt;But you don’t have to take just my word for it. I have a particularly opinionated friend who loves to rant how all the smartwatches I test are hulking eyesores that are too uncomfortable for her to ever consider buying one. But when she eyed the Sport, she grabbed my arm and said, “Is this smart? &lt;em&gt;Oh,&lt;/em&gt; I’d wear this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i6Y62"&gt;While the Sport is a design-forward tracker, you’d be wrong to assume it skimps on health features. It has optical heart rate and SpO2 sensors and can provide abnormal heart rate alerts. It’s also capable of measuring your respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and blood oxygen levels — both in the form of continuous measurement during sleep and spot checks. Stress tracking on most devices is also still a work in progress, but Garmin’s is better than most. Body battery is a neat metric that visualizes how much energy you have for activities. The gist is it measures a combination of your sleep quality, exercise, stress, and heart rate variability to determine whether or not you should push it or take it easy. While more wearables offer similar “readiness” metrics these days, they can be hit or miss. Garmin’s version has grown on me over the years as a helpful tool for figuring out when to slot in recovery days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7igw1m"&gt;The Sport is also accurate for a hybrid. Usually, hybrid watches are god-awful at tracking GPS activity. However, the Sport was dead on with my Apple Watch Series 7 across several runs. On a 3-mile run recorded by the Runkeeper app on my phone, the Sport reported 3.04 miles, and the Series 7 logged three miles. The Garmin said I was about 10 seconds faster per mile, but that granularity isn’t going to bother the casual users this watch caters to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZQGpK"&gt;I will say if you like heart rate zone training, this isn’t a good choice. Hybrid watches are never that great when it comes to looking at your stats mid-exercise, and the Sport isn’t an exception. That made it hard for me to evaluate real-time heart rate accuracy, but in reviewing my data afterward showed my max and average heart rate, as well as heart rate zone data was nearly identical to the Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UGq80rPAyq6R9W6n-YkUYfBz6F0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162059/vsong_220110_4962_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get a good number of sensors for more advanced health metrics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B3NAwc"&gt;This watch also wouldn’t be my pick for more intense outdoor activities like rock climbing or dirt biking. This is more suited to indoor workouts and shorter distance running or biking (5K-10K). You could take it into the pool, as it’s got 5 ATM of water resistance, and it withstood showers and dishwashing with no problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3epLe"&gt;Fitness-wise, my big complaint is the same as every other Garmin watch I’ve tested: the Garmin Connect app is a hot mess. Editing settings is like discovering more menus within other menus — a real Russian Doll scenario. It’s unnecessarily complicated to find what you’re looking for. Don’t get me wrong — I love how granular Garmin’s data gets. What I don’t love is how it’s organized. It’s fine for viewing your day-to-day data, but if you want to get into your historical data over time? Be prepared to decipher a color-coded calendar view, at least five menu categories for health and fitness metrics, as well as dozens of subcategories and graphs for each individual metric.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I recommend linking to Strava or another fitness app for a better experience. If you like the social aspect like challenges and ribbing your buddies, integrating with another service is probably going to be a better experience, even if it means you need two apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="d0huXQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not charging you the ability to access your data, and that’s something we will continue to do and that we feel very strongly about.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhEYpq"&gt;Overall, Garmin’s given Fitbit a real run for its money when it comes to basic trackers. Between this and the Fitbit Luxe, I’d pick the Sport. Although it’s more expensive at $179.99, you get all this data in the app for free. To get the most out of Fitbit’s app, you’ll eventually need a Fitbit Premium subscription. Advanced sleep insights and readiness scores, for example, are something you need to pay extra for once the free trial period is over. Over time, that makes the Sport the more affordable option. During my briefing with Garmin at CES, I asked whether the company would ever consider switching to a subscription model like many of its competitors. Phil McClendon, Garmin’s project lead for the Venu 2 Plus, said the company wouldn’t lock data behind a paywall. “It’s your data,” McClendon said. “We’re not charging you the ability to access your data, and that’s something we will continue to do and that we feel very strongly about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d16v_LAIA5wfSwAoxgH2NZWjnnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162057/vsong_220110_4962_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vivomove Sport is accurate, but while I appreciate how granular Garmin data is, I wish the app was simpler to navigate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8MBC3r"&gt;I’ve liked Garmin’s other hybrids, but they were always too pricey to be worth it for casual users, aka the core audience for hybrid watches. Fossil’s hybrids are elegant, and the e-ink is super cool. However, they’re a pain to navigate after a while, and it’s not a good choice for activity tracking or health features. The Withings Steel HR is the closest alternative, but its tiny notification window isn’t as helpful. Putting aside aesthetic preferences, I’d recommend the Steel HR if elegance and simplified wellness is more of your goal. The Sport is better if you’re a more active person — or hoping to become one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EbLsNP"&gt;Basically, if you’re looking to commit to regularly running or cycling 5Ks but not at the expense of style, the Sport is the way to go. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft commissions third-party review of its harassment and discrimination policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g5uJlS7mQ7JFskczc3GTU_2DBqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70386921/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ys5FnN"&gt;Microsoft’s board of directors is hiring a law firm to review the company’s policies on sexual harassment and discrimination after years of complaints of wrongdoing at the company. &lt;a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSBoardPolicy.docx?version=cc15d925-d108-b21f-6313-cb68323e4c56"&gt;The review&lt;/a&gt;, which will be conducted by law firm Arent Fox, will include a public transparency report “assessing the effectiveness of the company’s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG2NWC"&gt;It will also include an assessment of Microsoft’s previous investigation into allegations against the company’s co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates. &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2022/microsoft-board-approves-outside-review-of-harassment-and-discrimination-policies-including-assessment-of-bill-gates-investigation/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that this review won’t reinvestigate Gates’ affair with a company employee in the year 2000. Bill Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the Microsoft board&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/16/22439640/bill-gates-microsoft-board-alleged-affair-investigation"&gt;reportedly left&lt;/a&gt; before Microsoft had completed its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmIEuf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s review will assess an internal email chain full of complaints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W7zg8t"&gt;The board report will also examine multiple allegations of discrimination and harassment that were surfaced in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295647/microsoft-workers-sexual-harassment-stories-internal-email-chain"&gt;internal Microsoft email chain in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Allegations of sexual harassment, stories about demeaning behavior, and sexist comments were all highlighted in the email chain where Microsoft employees complained the company didn’t take any action in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8v3zd"&gt;Microsoft was also the subject of a five-year lawsuit over fair pay that was originally filed in 2015. The lawsuit, filed by former Microsoft employee Katie Moussouris, claimed that the company unfairly discriminated against female employees because of their gender. Moussouris dropped her case in 2020, but is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22331972/pay-equity-now-pledge-katie-moussouris-microsoft-lawsuit"&gt;fighting for fair pay&lt;/a&gt; across the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xRgX8"&gt;“We’re committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a statement accompanying the &lt;a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSBoardPolicy.docx?version=cc15d925-d108-b21f-6313-cb68323e4c56"&gt;announcement of the review&lt;/a&gt;. “I embrace this comprehensive review as an opportunity to continue to get better”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0YSRN"&gt;Here’s what Microsoft says its review will address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HWRaP1"&gt;“It will lead to the public release of a transparency report assessing the effectiveness of the company’s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies. This will include a review of concerns raised by employees in 2019 in the “In Need of Assistance” email thread, steps the company has taken to respond to these concerns, and additional steps that could further strengthen these safeguards. The review will also include an analysis of policies, practices, and commitments to create a safe, inclusive work environment.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FC1zfw"&gt;“The report will summarize the results of any sexual harassment investigations during this same timeframe against members of the Board of Directors and the company’s Senior Leadership Team, including the allegations that a Board committee investigated beginning in 2019 involving Bill Gates.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TRQIxX"&gt;“It will assess the steps that have been taken to hold employees, including executives, accountable for sexual harassment or gender discrimination.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8e0C6i"&gt;“The report will include data on the number of sexual harassment cases investigated and their resolution.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Google TV exploring fitness, smart home control, and other new features for 2022  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="imcrc4"&gt;Google TV’s director of product management Rob Caruso has outlined what the company’s plans are for its TV operating system in 2022 in a &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/whats-next-for-google-tv?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2"&gt;new interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While Caruso stopped short of making any specific feature announcements, he said that the company is interested in offering fitness and video conferencing services though Google TV, and better smart home controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tE0gw"&gt;Caruso called fitness a “big area of exploration,” and cited Android’s recent smart home control changes (which, for example, made them easily accessible from a phone’s power menu) as a clue for what might come to Google TV. Zoom was cited as a potential addition to the platform (Google’s own &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/duo/answer/10079968?hl=en-GB"&gt;Duo video calling service&lt;/a&gt; is already available), and he said Google is also interested in expanding the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820622/google-tv-pluto-live-tab"&gt;free live programming available on its platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TciJpg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Amazon have added similar features to their smart TV devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVyF8j"&gt;Caruso also spoke to the situation with Netflix on Google TV. Although the video streaming service is supported on Google’s platform, it doesn’t make use of some of its advanced features. &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes that Netflix shows can’t be added to Google TV’s OS-level watchlist, for example. Caruso didn’t promise that this will change, but said that he hopes the situation will improve as Google builds worthwhile new features into its OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9bRi5"&gt;Although Google’s TV operating system doesn’t typically get as much attention as its Android mobile OS, it’s still used by millions of devices around the world. As of this month, Google says there are around 110 million Android TV devices in use globally, and that seven of the top 10 smart TV manufacturers use its software. This includes both Android TV itself, as well as devices running the newer Google TV launcher alongside it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcXvwA"&gt;The areas of focus are similar to what are available on competing smart TV platforms from Apple and Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple’s Fitness Plus service&lt;/a&gt; allows you to stream workouts to an Apple TV, and Zoom is available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850298/amazon-fire-tv-omni-zoom-calls"&gt;some of Amazon’s TV devices&lt;/a&gt;. But given the huge reach of Google’s TV operating system, it would be good to see it reach parity with these other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urOwKM"&gt;No firm release dates for any of these new features were provided, but Caruso said that he hopes some might be introduced “at some point later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
