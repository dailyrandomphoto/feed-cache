    <title>Ecobee’s new home security service has a professional monitoring option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ecobee SmartCamera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Gz1B8cxDi6wcYM9eB5u3WkJZJs=/360x0:2520x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118947/ecobee_SmartCamera_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv0epS"&gt;Ecobee now gives you the option to pair its smart home monitoring devices with a professional security service. With the company’s new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-security%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Security&lt;/a&gt; service, which replaces the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;Haven service it formerly offered&lt;/a&gt;, you can enable 24/7 professional monitoring (which is still in beta) for an additional $10 / month as a part of the Complete subscription plan. This price is half of what Ring now charges for its Pro plan that comes with a &lt;a href="https://ring.com/protect-plan-2"&gt;professional live monitoring service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFbOi"&gt;Ecobee’s Smart Security service uses the &lt;a href="https://rapidsos.com/"&gt;RapidSOS&lt;/a&gt; emergency response platform to send crucial data to emergency responders. It relays your home’s entry and exit data to first responders, as well as any video and audio snippets captured by Ecobee devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MeEZVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ecobee is offering a $5 / month Standard plan and a $10 / month Complete plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHJHGR"&gt;To get started with the Smart Security service, you’ll need Ecobee’s smart sensors for doors and windows, which you can purchase as a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Faccessories%2Fsmart-door-window-sensor%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundle for $79.99&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;$99.99 SmartCamera&lt;/a&gt; also integrates with the service, as its optional video verification feature can send footage to monitoring centers whenever the camera detects the sound of a smoke alarm — if an emergency is confirmed, dispatchers may be able to send responders faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Fxc6c"&gt;If you don’t need live monitoring, Ecobee offers a $5 / month Standard subscription that comes with several other handy features (that are also included with the Complete plan). Aside from live monitoring, the Smart Security service can remind you to arm or disarm your house by using Wi-Fi and geofencing data to determine when you’re home. It will also send a notification to your phone when a door opens unexpectedly — Ecobee says that its system can tell the difference between your family members and an intruder, so you shouldn’t expect unnecessary notifications. You can check out the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-security%2F%23Compare-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of Smart Security features on Ecobee’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gQDj"&gt;As far as privacy goes, Ecobee says that it “will never sell or misuse your data” and that it uses “extra security layers like two-factor authentication so your account is secure.” Ecobee also notes that its SmartCamera switches off when it detects that you and your family are home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uefuav"&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that some features only work with certain devices. The entire Smart Security suite makes use of Ecobee’s lineup of gadgets, all of which it sells — sans SmartCamera — in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsolutions-exclusives%2Fefficiency-and-security-solution%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Efficiency and Security Solution bundle for $279.99&lt;/a&gt;. In case you want to add the SmartCamera with that bundle, expect to pay a total of $379.98.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpXAl4"&gt;If you don’t want to commit to $10 / month just yet, Ecobee is offering a free two-month trial.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FuboTV crosses 1 million subscribers six years after launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmPmMdKC0ijJsp8R6F9esJ369Xk=/0x15:1844x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118913/Screen_Shot_2021_11_09_at_5.00.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FuboTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mmt4Ek"&gt;Sports-focused streaming TV service FuboTV has surpassed 1 million subscribers, the company announced today. The news came as part of FuboTV’s &lt;a href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Reaches-One-Million-Subscribers/default.aspx"&gt;third-quarter financial earnings report&lt;/a&gt;: it ended Q3 with 944,605 subscribers but crossed the million figure after the quarter closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXveNr"&gt;“FuboTV’s achievement of hitting the 1 million subscriber mark since the third quarter ended is an extraordinary milestone by any measure but particularly remarkable given the momentum of our business over six short years,” said co-founder and CEO David Gandler. FuboTV is also highlighting its growth in revenue, advertising earnings, and viewing hours. The latter reached 284 million hours of streamed content during the quarter, up 113 percent year over year. In his letter to shareholders, Gandler said, “1 million subscribers means increased relevance, leverage and influence with content partners and leagues, and the opportunity to go upstream on tentpole sports properties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4cfKV"&gt;“To put this in perspective, as of the end of the second quarter 2020, we had approximately 286,000 subscribers,” Gandler added. “And, even at the one million subscriber mark, we believe we are still just scratching the surface of the massive opportunity ahead of us with 72.6 million subscribers still active on traditional pay television.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyIbnl"&gt;Still, that FuboTV is just now hitting the all-important 1 million milestone shows how hard it can be to compete with streaming heavyweights and larger TV-centric services, like YouTube TV, Sling TV, and Hulu with Live TV. Rich Greenfield of &lt;a href="https://lightshedtmt.com/2021/09/27/is-comcasts-nbcu-fighting-a-losing-battle-with-googles-youtube-tv-the-industrys-largest-vmpvd/"&gt;LightShed Partners&lt;/a&gt; recently estimated that YouTube TV has around 4 million subscribers, making it the largest internet TV provider in the United States, followed closely by Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci9w4A"&gt;FuboTV’s channel bundles &lt;a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome%3Futm_source%3Dcommercial%26utm_keyword%3DTV%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3DTV%26ftv_campaign%3DTV&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;start at $64.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;, which includes 116 channels, 250 hours of cloud DVR storage, and three concurrent streams. The top-tier Elite package increases that to 162 channels, 1,000 hours of DVR space, and 10 simultaneous streams. That starting price is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;the same as YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; after the Google-owned service sharply raised its subscription rate in June of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVz68"&gt;FuboTV also announced that it’s acquiring Molotov SAS, described as “France’s number one live TV streaming company,” and Edisn.ai, an AI company that specializes in video recognition. FuboTV says its tech will be used for “interactive experiences, personalization and platform stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse’s new CEO admits the startup’s electric van is no workhorse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rK9kAKpWsUB8IDcekXAF_wHBbxk=/0x67:1600x1134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118518/E3nZHe_XMAED9jF.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Workhorse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyh33T"&gt;The new CEO of struggling EV startup Workhorse admitted Tuesday that he’s not sure the company’s C-1000 electric van can stand up to the kind of punishing work required by delivery companies. In other words, Workhorse’s EV isn’t a workhorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYsdV8"&gt;“As I’ve talked to the big customers at UPS, FedEx, others, they expect to have these trucks last 15 to 20 years and go 15 to 20,000 miles a year and carry up to seven or 8,000 pounds of payload,” CEO Rick Dauch said during a revealing conference call about the company’s &lt;a href="https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/185/workhorse-group-reports-third-quarter-2021-results"&gt;third-quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m pretty darn sure the C-1000 can’t meet those kind of stringent requirements. Okay? That’s the bad news.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oLd2L"&gt;More bad news? Not only does Workhorse have to redesign its flagship C-1000 delivery vehicle, but Dauch also said it might not be possible to salvage the van as a mass-production product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpKHWE"&gt;The good news, Dauch said, is that prospective customers have told him they will take “every C-1000 [Workhorse] can build in 2022 so they can start demonstrating to their teams and their customers in the field how an EV vehicle works versus an [internal combustion] vehicle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NLZAb4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m pretty darn sure the C-1000 can’t meet those kind of stringent requirements.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iKirqW"&gt;Dauch believes there’s a lot of room for large electric commercial vehicles like the ones Workhorse has been developing — and, in fact, he said Tuesday that he’s been working with his new executive team to draft a refreshed product roadmap — but its best bet in the near term may be to sell demonstration vehicles to these apparently eager buyers. He said Workhorse has enough supplies on hand to build “somewhere north of 500 vehicles” in 2022 before it would need to bring in any new raw material. But even that’s only if Workhorse is able to fix the C-1000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9f26m"&gt;“If we can look each other in the eyes, and we can pass every single test, and we can make the modifications on the vehicles we’ve already built, and we can make those design changes on the next vehicles we build, then yes, we could probably do that, but we haven’t made that decision yet,” Dauch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgZ645"&gt;Still, he said, “we are a real company and not a PowerPoint EV company,” as he guided investors through the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDpV9v"&gt;Dauch took over as CEO of Workhorse in July, at a time when the EV startup was in disarray. It was racing to ship electric delivery vehicles that we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;weren’t compliant with federal safety standards&lt;/a&gt;. It was building those vehicles with parts bought through online auctions and flown in from Asia, cementing their money-losing status. Even the factory in Union City, Indiana was surrounded by debris and unpaved roads, Dauch said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJWrHu"&gt;But now Dauch, who came from automotive supplier Delphi, has detailed a corporate exorcism he believes can save the struggling startup. He cleaned house at the leadership level. He recalled the unprofitable, non-compliant vehicles. He scuttled the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675630/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-bid-protest-dropped-oshkosh"&gt;costly legal fight over the lost bid to build the next-generation mail truck for the US Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;. He even paved the roads at the Union City plant. And now he wants Workhorse to “pioneer the transition to zero emission commercial vehicles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZofCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup faces twin investigations by the SEC and DOJ&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgSUKM"&gt;“We’re taking the sometimes painful but necessary early steps to reshape our company to become a more focused and capable industry leader in the EV space,” Dauch said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvLeU5"&gt;Surviving, let alone leading, will be a challenge. Workhorse confirmed this week that it’s under investigation from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765287/doj-investigation-ev-workhorse-accounting-fraud-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;regarding allegations of fraud&lt;/a&gt;. (The company says it’s cooperating with the probes.) Workhorse has to navigate all of this while massive players like General Motors and Ford and well-funded startups like Arrival and Rivian push into the commercial EV space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiOmOr"&gt;One “painful” step Dauch described Tuesday was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;recalling all 41 of the C-1000s that Workhorse had delivered this year&lt;/a&gt; — a decision that cost the company at least $1.1 million in the short term, leaving it with &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; $576,000 in revenue for the quarter. (Workhorse posted an $81 million loss overall and has $230 million in the bank.) “Our current C-1000 vehicle design is not robust, nor is it profitable,” Dauch said on the call.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2IQcY"&gt;But the decision was necessary for two reasons, he explained. Most importantly, the C-1000s that went out to customers this year were not compliant with multiple Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Certain parts of the electronics were not up to snuff. Neither were the windshield wipers and defogging system nor the lamps and reflective safety devices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CMArn"&gt;“As a new startup company, we just weren’t experienced enough [around] some of the regulations and standards that we need to hold ourselves accountable to under FMVSS,” he said. While he expects Workhorse to be done putting the C-1000 through new testing by the end of the year, Dauch said he won’t put the van back on the road if it’s not safe. “I’m not going to jeopardize anybody’s life or any family’s lives on the road.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PxYtWr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dauch said the previous leadership team’s spending was “almost ludicrous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRjCAv"&gt;Another “painful” step Dauch described Tuesday was cleaning shop at the executive and vice president level. That, too, was costly for the startup. Workhorse’s general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $4.6 million higher than compared to last year, in part because of severance packages for the people who got Workhorse into its current mess, including the former CEO, CFO, and vice president of finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rChZRS"&gt;Dispatching that team opened up room for Dauch to hire his own staff. He touted seven of them on the call, all men, most of whom have deep backgrounds in the automotive or related industries. And he said it would be up to them (and him) to rebuild Workhorse’s supply chain, retain customers while courting new ones, and chart a new course for the company’s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi7vj6"&gt;Dauch has made at least one decision since taking over that didn’t sound painful: abandoning the company’s lawsuit against the government, which it filed after it lost the contest to build the Postal Service’s next-generation mail truck. Workhorse was spending “a hell of a lot of money” on outside consultants, legal firms, and lobbying groups, Dauch said. In fact, he said Workhorse’s previous leadership team had been paying “five times more” for consultants than it would have been paying in-house employees for similar roles. “That’s just, like, almost ludicrous.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord fans are worried NFTs might be on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xz5fmuNae3GQgh_edef6Fhdj9Z4=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118458/cover6.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s882xA"&gt;After an image of a Discord survey inquiring about users’ attitudes on NFTs went viral, social media erupted as people speculated if Discord would be the newest participant in the NFT scam race / gold rush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKG1AK"&gt;It’s not... yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cX7IAR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh No &lt;a href="https://t.co/YEfVt8Xrwe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YEfVt8Xrwe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Scott (@textfiles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UmaCsj"&gt;The image is from a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210819000600/https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6469752/Discord-Web3-Survey"&gt;now-expired survey&lt;/a&gt; that was distributed in August of this year. Among questions about the participant’s knowledge of NFTs and whatever the hell Web3 means,  the survey asks open-ended questions about their favorite crypto Discord communities and what, if any, crypto-related problems Discord could potentially solve. According to a Discord spokesperson, the survey was only a fact-finding endeavor targeted specifically toward users active in cryptocurrency communities on Discord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfahrW"&gt;“We’re always exploring and hacking away at things we think will improve Discord for all the communities we serve,” a Discord spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This includes research that helps us learn about what people want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1z8KQ"&gt;So no, there will be no wumpus-themed NFTs hitting a Discord server near you anytime soon. Still, even the notion that Discord might be dipping its toes into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;fetid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;NFT waters&lt;/a&gt; was enough to inspire backlash with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ironicsoap/status/1457929601385000961"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiberFLIM/status/1457892473892577288?s=20"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/the_stinja/status/1457995396043575297?s=20"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of their canceled Nitro subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4vMe3"&gt;Even if Discord isn’t making its own NFT yet, there does seem to be the possibility it might be planning or at least thinking about other blockchain integrations. In response to a &lt;a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/discord-imagine-a-place"&gt;Substack blog post&lt;/a&gt; discussing Discord’s potential as an NFT / Web3 powerhouse, Discord CEO Jason Citron posted a tweet featuring an image of what looks like some kind of Discord / crypto wallet integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yqbuAt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;probably nothing &lt;a href="https://t.co/p4P6MoNGgd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/p4P6MoNGgd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwaWbZ"&gt;The image is from an internal hackfest project and not necessarily indicative of a product currently under development, but Discord wouldn’t be the first gaming or gaming-adjacent company to participate in the byzantine blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ellfgW"&gt;Blockchain video games are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft"&gt;a thing&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like every day there’s a new big gaming company — like &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ea-calls-nft-and-blockchain-games-the-future-of-our-industry/"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/01/ubisoft-reveals-plans-to-develop-blockchain-games-and-nfts"&gt;Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-sounds-keen-on-nfts-and-blockchain-games-1848014388"&gt;Square Enix&lt;/a&gt; — announcing its involvement or teasing its interest in the cryptosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrFqjy"&gt;If your finger was hovering over the “cancel Nitro” button based on the perception that a Discord NFT / blockchain integration was in the works, you can ease up, but only a little bit. Discord did not respond to questions about whether it would offer cryto-based products in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is taking sign-ups for Relate, a voice assistant that recognizes impaired speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google launched a new app called Relate, a voice assistant that recognizes impaired speech." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Is9kWCq8AkLMhhOofAQEnztcuoM=/0x0:3499x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118298/PROEJCT_RELATE_PRESS_IMAGE_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google launched a new app called Relate, a voice assistant that recognizes impaired speech. | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecMxCS"&gt;Google launched a beta app today that people with speech impairments can use as a voice assistant while contributing to a multiyear research effort to improve Google’s speech recognition. The goal is to make Google Assistant, as well as other features that use speech to text and speech to speech, more inclusive of users with neurological conditions that affect their speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHZtSS"&gt;The new app is called Project Relate, and volunteers can sign up at &lt;a href="http://g.co/ProjectRelate"&gt;g.co/ProjectRelate&lt;/a&gt;. To be eligible to participate, volunteers need to be 18 or older and “&lt;a href="https://ctspeechhearing.org/news/579626/Project-Relate-Beta-Looking-for-Early-Testers-.htm"&gt;have difficulty being understood by others.&lt;/a&gt;” They’ll also need a Google account and an Android phone using OS 8 or later. For now, it’s only available to English speakers in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. They’ll be tasked with recording 500 phrases, which should take between 30 to 90 minutes to record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vQkECw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volunteers will get access to three new features on the Relate App&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0FG7r"&gt;After sharing their voice samples, volunteers will get access to three new features on the Relate App. It can transcribe their speech in real time. It also has a feature called “Repeat” that will restate what the user said in “a clear, synthesized voice.” That can help people with speech impairments when having conversations or when using voice commands for home assistant devices. The Relate App also connects to Google Assistant to help users turn on the lights or play a song with their voices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gBjv5Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EU2oCVlzEZk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6tCPl"&gt;Without enough training data, other Google apps like Translate and Assistant haven’t been very accessible for people with conditions like ALS, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or Parkinson’s disease. In 2019, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535674/google-project-euphonia-live-relay-speech-recognition-disabilities-impairments-io-2019"&gt;started Project Euphonia&lt;/a&gt;, a broad effort to improve its AI algorithms by collecting data from people with impaired speech. Google is also training its algorithms to recognize sounds and gestures so that it can better help people who cannot speak. That work is still ongoing; Google and its partners &lt;a href="https://blog.lsvtglobal.com/project-euphonia/"&gt;still appear to be collecting patients’ voices separately&lt;/a&gt; for Project Euphonia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCUkn7"&gt;“I’m used to the look on people’s faces when they can’t understand what I’ve said,” Aubrie Lee, a brand manager at Google whose speech is affected by muscular dystrophy, said &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/project-relate/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “Project Relate can make the difference between a look of confusion and a friendly laugh of recognition.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWasuc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FVW6gK"&gt;Earbuds have been the listening choice of many for ages, and sales of wireless earbuds took off when Apple removed the headphone jack of the iPhone 7 and released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, seemingly every brand under the sun, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745711/palm-buds-pro-announced-pricing-features"&gt;some resurrected from the depths&lt;/a&gt;, have released true wireless earbuds. Some are small and cheap. Some are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;big and expensive&lt;/a&gt;. Some have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;one-size-fits-most hard plastic designs&lt;/a&gt;. Some have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222930/apple-airpods-tip-replacements-for-sale-online"&gt;user-replaceable rubber tips&lt;/a&gt; that accommodate different size ears. But one thing that unites all earbuds is that, eventually, they get disgustingly gross, with a buildup of earwax and debris that can hinder sound quality and reduce overall volume output. As a result, you should take the time to clean them once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xh3C6Z"&gt;Here we go over some of the various ways you can clean your earbuds — encompassing hard plastic and soft rubber-tipped earbuds —  using basic tools and methods that anyone can feel comfortable using. Our goal is to get your earbuds nice and clean with minimal risk of damage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFrt_LR7-Dhc4RRo3N5r3XllRHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22999013/adibenedetto_211108_4868_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different types of earbuds may require slightly different approaches and tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="meQLJC"&gt;A small word of caution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PiLx2k"&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that most manufacturers advise cleaning earbuds with only a clean microfiber cloth or dry cotton swab. Instructions from major manufacturers like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00086123/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208729"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; advise refraining from using rubbing alcohol or other liquids. A simple alcohol wipe might be fine for some surfaces if kept away from any speaker grills, mic holes, or charging ports — but it does present some dangers. If you try using any wet processes or cleaners, you do so at your own risk. And it may sound obvious, but it bears emphasizing: &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;submerge earbuds or charging cases in any type of liquid to clean them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TciEXa"&gt;Starting with the basics &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZ1rHHLJXf0jkmXmDL4tedrSI_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22999012/adibenedetto_211108_4868_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simple tools get the job done. Pictured: a bulb blower, brush, toothpick, putty, microfiber cloth, cotton swab, and spudger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h4buPC"&gt;A “less is more” approach is always the way to go when cleaning electronics. So let’s begin by going over the simplest and least risky ways of cleaning the buildup from most earbuds. Begin with the most basic cleaning tools and work your way up until the earbuds are adequately clean. There’s no need to get invasive with a toothpick if a puff of air takes care of it, right? Always start small before jumping to extremes, and use only what the job calls for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRyQyq"&gt;Many of the tools mentioned here are common household items. You can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cleaning-Accessories-Sanitize-Maintain-Earphones/dp/B08LDSDMW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cleaning kits for earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that have a lot of similar tools, but you may already have what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qf4fKf"&gt;Forced air&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="fJ9EmM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855018"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JrBflp"&gt;While blowing air from your mouth into your earbuds might knock away some dust or flakey earwax, it will most likely be inadequate, and you could inadvertently deposit tiny bits of saliva onto something that goes in your ears — not exactly sanitary. Try the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XplzfI"&gt;A bulb / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Giottos-AA1900-Rocket-Blaster-Large/dp/B00017LSPI?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rocket blower&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W6pO25"&gt;Canned air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oYcyez"&gt;For hard plastic earbuds, point the dirty speaker grills away from you and toward the floor. Try pointing the blower up and into the earbud speaker grills, away from your face. You want to prevent any debris from potentially flying towards your eyes (it doesn’t hurt to wear glasses or basic protective eyewear — nobody is going to judge you), and you also want gravity on your side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzdhm6"&gt;For earbuds with removable soft rubber tips, carefully slip them off and hold the tip toward the floor. Blow air into and through the opening in the earbud tip, pointing downward and away from you. Then flip them around and blow air through the other side before moving to the earbud itself and blowing out any debris that made it to the speaker grills. Once the rubber tips are removed, they become the only part of earbuds that you can safely clean with liquids. If you choose to clean the detached tips with water, let them dry overnight to ensure there is no remaining moisture before you put them back on the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZb4AW"&gt;If this basic process is enough to blow away the debris and leave your earbuds looking clean enough, take a clean and dry microfiber cloth to all surfaces and polish away any remaining dirt. If the buildup is hardened and not budging, then keep your canned air or blower nearby while we get more invasive to try and break up the gunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLk0AO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t forget the charging case: &lt;/strong&gt;Forced air and a microfiber cloth will often be enough to clean out any dirt that gets transferred from wireless earbuds to its charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6AALuH"&gt;Toothpicks, cotton swabs, and more scraping and brushing tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="xa9qft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZYTVm"&gt;A puff of air is rarely enough for stuck buildup, especially if you have overly waxy ears (I’m here for you; and lordy, do I commiserate). The next stage is to use a small tool to break up the earwax or buildup of debris without risking damage. You are about to take a pick or probe to a piece of electronics, so practice some care and caution. Consider the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v2tyYG"&gt;Cotton swab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UHIckM"&gt;Basic wood or plastic toothpick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3bz9Q1"&gt;Plastic spudger tool (akin to the ones &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FStore%2FTools%2FSpudger%2FIF145-002%3Fo%3D4&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759139%2Fearbuds-wireless-airpods-clean-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit includes with many DIY repair kits&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RMcULD"&gt;Wood skewer (typically used for food / cooking)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hs12yw"&gt;Dry brush (toothbrushes are good, but never take any chances using them for dental care after this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BxAiFe"&gt;Pipe cleaner (the arts and crafts kind) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="eo1LKO"&gt;Note that we are choosing tools here that are soft (cotton, brushes) or firm but not too hard (wood, plastic), as metal might cause scratches or damage to the speaker grills or plastic shell of an earbud. As usual, we want to start with the least invasive and work our way up if it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pw4q4X"&gt;For hard plastic earbuds, start with the cotton swab and try to break up and wipe away debris or wax in the speaker grills. Angle them downward to let gravity help your cause. If the swab is not strong enough, step up to a toothpick, spudger, or wood skewer and carefully break up the buildup embedded at the corners and edges of the speaker’s cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gApM0m"&gt;For soft rubber tips, the toothpick might be one of the best tools — it can fit through the hole of a detached earbud tip and scrape the inner wall. Be sure to also clean the exposed speaker with the cotton swab, brush, or toothpick if wax has been deposited on it. If your earbuds have a rubberized fin or comb to help secure their fit in your ear, these might be best cleaned with the toothbrush. A pipe cleaner can be very helpful for these soft rubber bits as well, but due to its metal rod core, it should not be used on much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GWJl4"&gt;Once you break up the stubborn buildup, blow more air from a can or blower and see if that finally removes the debris. Take a polishing cloth to all the surfaces, and hopefully, you now have some adequately clean earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF6U5V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Keep a water-dampened paper towel or sponge handy, and you can neatly wipe away all the gross stuff as it collects on your toothpick while minimizing the mess. Be prepared to clean your workspace after you’re all done, as you might be surprised how much debris comes out when doing a deep clean on long-neglected earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="03CKdm"&gt;The final tools for some hard-to-reach cleaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="0mk6XH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rDlk1G"&gt;If you broke up some of the dirt, but getting it out with forced air or a brush is proving tricky, there are a couple more tools to try. The following can be used in tandem with all the previously mentioned tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QxUXsT"&gt;Masking tape or painter’s tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="koKEK0"&gt;Mounting putty or cleaning gel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HQMm8c"&gt;Vacuum with a small nozzle attachment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3RUn4q"&gt;Using tape or putty to help pull out debris from deeper crevices can hopefully be all that you need to fully clean all the nooks and crannies of your earbuds. The adhesive of masking or painter’s tape is sticky enough to pick up dirt but light enough to not leave any residue on the surface like stronger tapes might. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMV9J3"&gt;If dirt is really deep in an earbud tip and hard to reach, the tape may not get to it. That’s where putty (the kind used in arts and crafts for safely mounting things to the wall) or a cleaning gel can come in. Warm up the putty by kneading a small amount of it in your hands, and roll it over the affected area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4H5K8"&gt;At this point, the combination of all these tools should clean away most earbud gunk. Some especially dirty buds might require repeated and alternating use from a combination of air, scraper, and putty. The key is to work at it, little by little, until the earbuds are clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UyTxoT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10855183"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rJePg0"&gt;The more frequently you clean your earbuds, the less dirt and buildup there is and the fewer tools and elbow grease you need. If you prevent earbuds from getting too dirty, you ensure that they will last longer and hopefully be less prone to reduced sound quality or breakage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PunU3J"&gt;As often the case, a little preventative care can help save you from costly repairs or replacements down the road. So be sure to store your wireless earbuds in their charging case when not in use, shielding them from further buildup like pocket lint, and don’t forget to give them the occasional check and clean.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces its next-gen RAM for phones and ‘the metaverse’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/is3lyUe0H97S94WbD186Da_Go2E=/0x42:2000x1375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118221/Samsung_LPDDR5X_DRAM_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbCO0W"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-industrys-first-lpddr5x-dram"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; its next-generation RAM tech made for mobile devices, which it says can be used in future smartphones but also in servers, cars, and “the metaverse.” While Samsung’s press release doesn’t mention how its new LPDDR5X RAM chips could help people enter the “digital reality,” the tech should help make devices run faster and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsHQxN"&gt;Putting the buzzwords like metaverse, AI, and 5G aside, Samsung is promising some real improvements to speed and power usage: it says its next-gen RAM will have 1.3-times faster processing speeds versus the previous-gen LPDDR5, will be capable of higher densities (up to 64GB per chip), and will use 20 percent less power than the last generation. Some of these improvements, according to Samsung, can be chalked up to the new 14nm process it’s using to create the chips. Also, for all the ribbing about the metaverse, lower-power draw and better performance could actually help with AR and VR headsets with onboard processors or phones that are driving those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pBAd70"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ecLAES"&gt;Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification about the improvements of the 14nm process versus its previous-gen RAM chips, which &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-begins-mass-production-of-16gb-lpddr5-dram-at-worlds-largest-semiconductor-line"&gt;it marketed as “10nm-class,”&lt;/a&gt; meaning &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-industrys-first-8gb-lpddr5-dram-for-5g-and-ai-powered-mobile-applications"&gt;that the process was between 10nm and 20nm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="temZrD"&gt;Samsung doesn’t say when its LPDDR5X RAM chips will be available to manufacturers (including Samsung’s phone division), but &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17058/samsung-announces-lpddr5x-at-85gbps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; has speculated&lt;/a&gt; that they’ll start showing up in devices around 2023. &lt;a href="https://overclock3d.net/reviews/cpu_mainboard/intel_12th_gen_ddr4_vs_ddr5_with_asus_z690_plus_tuf_gaming_d4/1"&gt;As with regular-power DDR5&lt;/a&gt;, which is making its way to desktop computers, it’s not likely that you’ll be able to immediately notice a massive generational leap between devices using LPDDR5 and LPDDR5X memory. However, it’s these kinds of improvements that help our devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749341/smartphones-future-predictions"&gt;get better and better with each generation&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s nice to see Samsung pushing one of the less exciting aspects of a phone’s performance forward — even if it’s using vague promises about the metaverse to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Netflix is getting into video games&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="5hhtFz"&gt;Netflix is making a big push into video games. The company first dabbled in games with interactive titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game, but in 2021, it made gaming a much bigger priority. Netflix hired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;a former EA exec&lt;/a&gt; in July to lead its gaming efforts and, in November, let people play a selection of mobile games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; as part of their subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rlEk"&gt;We’ll be watching Netflix’s gaming efforts closely, and you can read our coverage right here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNi04P"&gt;Netflix just brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;its new gaming service to all subscribers on Android&lt;/a&gt;, but now it has officially come to iOS. The service gives users access to a limited selection of mobile games without ads or in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGhJRX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1458133903160479746?s=20"&gt;A tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman confirms that the five launch games are already available as individual downloads from the App Store. These include &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/stranger-things-1984/id1574739824"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stranger-things-3-the-game/id1574824199"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3: The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/shooting-hoops/id1585735348"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/teeter-up/id1585735663"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teeter (Up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/card-blast/id1586360462"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Card Blast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The just-announced game &lt;a href="https://hextechmayhem.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  — which will cost $10 on Switch and PC — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772338/league-of-legends-spinoff-netflix-games-nintendo-switch-hextech-mayhem"&gt;will be free to Netflix subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Netflix Games is coming to iOS! Starting tomorrow, you can access Netflix Games through the Netflix app on any mobile device, anywhere in the world. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LoHYFi4xBX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LoHYFi4xBX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iJK7mE"&gt;There’s been some concern about Netflix Games’ rollout on iOS, particularly because of Apple’s App Store policies that have gotten in the way of other gaming platforms and services. The policy typically prevents third-party apps from acting as storefronts for apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6tSmY"&gt;Per the tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393"&gt;@NetflixGeeked&lt;/a&gt;, tomorrow we’ll find out how Netflix adjusts its main app and if it serves as an all-in-one gaming hub as it does on Android, where users can select games to download from the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwMcw8"&gt;Other cloud gaming platforms, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Microsoft xCloud, Nvidia Geforce Now, Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook Gaming, have struggled to find footing on iOS due to Apple’s demanding App Store restrictions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;All&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; have attempted to sidestep Apple’s policies by launching as web apps, but this obviously doesn’t provide the best gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzjE2u"&gt;However, there might be a precedent for Netflix’s good fortune. In internal emails uncovered in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;Apple went over possible concessions&lt;/a&gt; related to third-party apps offering in-app purchases and different incentives that might appeal to Netflix. It reportedly wanted Netflix to continue selling subscriptions within its app so it could earn a cut of the money. If Apple was willing to treat Netflix as a special case then, it could do the same now. Google allegedly engaged in the same kind of behavior with Netflix, as lawyers claimed that Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22645974/google-netflix-class-action-antitrust-play-store-commission"&gt;giving Netflix a break&lt;/a&gt; on the standard 30 percent commission it takes out of purchases made through Google Play Billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehaM97"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/netflix-launches-games-on-iphone-ipad-with-apple-payment-system?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gurman notes that players who launch the Netflix Games apps individually without an account are prompted to sign up for Netflix using Apple’s in-app system. If someone does that, then Apple receives a 30 percent cut of their payments for the first year, then 15 percent of each payment after that. Netflix still doesn’t send new customers through Apple’s payment system in its main app, but this odd arrangement may have been enough to get Netflix Games on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even Tim Sweeney thinks the Dell XPS 17 needs better cooling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Dell Xps 17" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fJZcmzqXt8FqXksENkmj2CKGixU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118094/mchin_181005_4093_0011.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tf9aNc"&gt;Tim Sweeney has made many headlines this year as the main character of Epic’s turbulent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;courtroom war with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. But on Tuesday, the CEO appears to have revealed an equally noteworthy side of himself: He’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 17&lt;/a&gt; user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQqqJi"&gt;Sweeney’s affinity for the XPS 17 dates as far back as September of this year. The executive tweeted a link to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1439772094653509633"&gt;Dell’s XPS 17 purchase page&lt;/a&gt; on the 19th, remarking that the laptop had “great options, simple view, customer-friendly defaults, reasonable prices, easy checkout.” Further down the thread, Sweeney complained that the high prices of entry-level workstations often drive developers to purchase gaming PCs instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMxYAw"&gt;Almost two months later, a new tweet suggests that Sweeney has joined the ranks of XPS 17 users. While he doesn’t directly state that he’s purchased an XPS 17 for himself, his impressions indicate that he’s spent at least some hands-on time with the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwaNZS"&gt;“The Dell XPS 17 is a good laptop but not great,” Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1457937413033054209"&gt;now writes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “Amazing screen, good keyboard and pad, but super awkward Home/End key placement for coding.” But his primary concern is the cooling system. Per the CEO, the XPS 17 “[r]uns hot even when idle” and “constantly chirps out RF noise from CPU activity through the speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSmmE8"&gt;Hello, Tim. Welcome to the world of portable workstations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2szWqj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Dell XPS 17 is a good laptop but not great. Amazing screen, good keyboard and pad, but super awkward Home/End key placement for coding (earlier Dells supported FN+Left/Right). Runs hot even when idle, constantly chirps out RF noise from CPU activity through the speaker. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7bS46meTrk"&gt;https://t.co/7bS46meTrk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1457937413033054209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mbibQf"&gt;Dell XPS laptops are excellent and well worth their high sticker price — but they’re also notoriously incompetent at keeping their chips cool. The last time I reviewed an XPS 17, the chip spent a solid amount of time over 90 degrees Celsius. Its smaller sibling, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;, has been an even worse offender in the past — I could hear its fans a room over during my testing, the keyboard was toasty under any kind of load, and the bottom was often so hot that I couldn’t keep the device on my lap. I’ve even seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13 2-in-1 &lt;/a&gt;hit 100 a few times. And the noise to which Sweeney refers is likely coil whine, which has been a common complaint against XPS laptops for years now. (It doesn’t mean a laptop is bad, but it is annoying.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now this is an awesome laptop configurator. Great options, simple view, customer-friendly defaults, reasonable prices, easy checkout. Now do workstations!&lt;a href="https://t.co/Z9gjOJjWpT"&gt;https://t.co/Z9gjOJjWpT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1439770926787215362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NClN5g"&gt;It seems here that Mr. Sweeney has run into one of the most common perils of premium laptop shopping: the price of thinness. The XPS 17 straddles the line between a business and a consumer PC — its reasonable price and customer-friendly purchase interface make it a viable buy for single-unit shoppers, but it also has the thin and light build, as well as the power, that corporate customers often demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl500c"&gt;But those benefits still come with tradeoffs, and that’s particularly true when it comes to cooling heavy-duty chips. Even the best manufacturers on the market (setting aside Apple’s most recent MacBook Pro models — they’re in a league of their own) haven’t really figured out how to keep a workstation as thin and light as the XPS 17 both quiet and cold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drc61Z"&gt;I’m sure there are battalions of engineers across OEMs working on this problem as we speak. Please know, engineers, that we are all rooting for you. In the meantime, my advice to Mr. Sweeney would be to utilize the “Quiet” cooling profile in Dell’s power manager. &lt;/p&gt;
