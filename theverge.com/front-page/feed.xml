    <title>A year without Marvel movies left a pop culture void </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2hjCXEOucswJ-H-KVd6x9pSKCVU=/135x0:1755x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68515568/tony_star_engdame.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kN6ix0"&gt;In early April, I watched a clip of people crying, hollering, and clapping during a scene in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. It was the first time I remember missing physically sitting in a movie theater. I thought by May, when &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;was scheduled to be released, life would return to normal. I’d be back in a theater on Thursday night with friends, sitting among a packed room full of strangers chatting excitedly about the beginning of a new Marvel Cinematic Universe phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZLFqM"&gt;That never happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg8Wsi"&gt;Instead, 2020 has become the first year since 2009 without a major addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There’s no big introduction of a new superhero, no highly anticipated sequel — there’s not even an entry in Marvel Studios’ MCU TV universe. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, once slated to premiere this month, won’t hit until January 15th. &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;was supposed to kick things off in August of this year, and now it doesn’t have a premiere date at all. There’s no big Marvel &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8cIV1E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And of course the theater reaction to PORTALS was bonkers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tllxg9aqMG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tllxg9aqMG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Scott Gustin (@ScottGustin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGustin/status/1247371234880499712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C6fFX4"&gt;In a year where I feel more disconnected from people than ever, where I’m searching for community from the confines of a tiny studio apartment, not having that quintessential part of normalcy — sitting in a theater and watching the couple of Marvel movies that come out every year — feels enormous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InnTNs"&gt;The absence of Marvel movies is the absence of a very specific kind of excitement. Living within the confines of our new normal for the last 10 months means trying to find little things to look forward to every week. A new show on a streaming service helps or a Zoom catch-up with family who can’t visit. But it doesn’t replace the physicality of community or the excitement of leaving home to experience something people may have been waiting on for several months. In 2020, a year filled with death and travesty at the worst of times and mindless boredom at the best of times, the absence of unbridled anticipation was tough to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOCybh"&gt;Marvel’s disappearance didn’t just echo through subreddit forums and on stan Twitter. It severely impacted business for a number of companies in the entertainment industry. Disney went from having its strongest third quarter ever in 2019 with the release of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, which brought in more than $2.8 billion, to one of its worst without any notable releases. Since Disney acquired Marvel Entertainment in 2009, the IP has brought in nearly $30 billion. That doesn’t include merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJtSqp"&gt;There are also theaters. In a moment where Hollywood is struggling to get people to tear their eyes away from Netflix, TikTok, and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, theaters are reliant on major tentpole event movies — like a new entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — to bring people in. In 2008, Marvel Cinematic Universe movies made up about 6 percent of the US box office; by 2019, it was more than 15 percent, with Disney controlling close to 40 percent of the total US box office market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cdLC4U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The absence of unbridled anticipation was tough to swallow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4aa0eb"&gt;A new Marvel movie would come out, it would dominate pop culture discussion around the world for a few weeks or months — giving us a fresh round of memes and plenty of Twitter discourse — and then start up again by the time the next one rolled around. This happens with other movies, of course, but with Marvel, everything felt like it was on a grand scale. A subreddit deleting half of its members over the course of a couple of days all because of a joke in &lt;em&gt;Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;was something we could participate in together, even if it was online. That moment was spurred by an event that millions of people experienced in movie theaters together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M4QSk"&gt;The pandemic has become a lesson in adapting to a new normal. The beauty (or nightmare, depending on who you ask) of Marvel movies is that there’s always one or two just around the corner. That absence of excitement is beginning to fade; in part because &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;has helped to make the last few weeks fun again. I’m getting excited about &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which will premiere on Disney Plus in just over a month. I’m excited about having that week-to-week discussion and feeling of community online again when episodes drop. I’m excited for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, and hopeful that we may be at a place where we can pile into a movie theater and fall back into a world with a character that’s been on-screen since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVUesT"&gt;A year without Marvel movies is significant to me, but Marvel can be replaced with any number of things. Concerts, basketball games, church outings, or nights at the local bar — it’s the quiet bonding that we experience that emphasizes our communities. It’s the feeling of intimacy inside a sea of strange faces. It’s that inexplicable sense of true unity in the face of this &lt;em&gt;thing &lt;/em&gt;that we love so much. As much as I can’t wait for the next MCU release, I’m more excited to get that feeling back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEdXH9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrqzpG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upRaZz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zrXLs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="869SF9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms stylus support is coming to Galaxy phones like the S21</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LTNpuJ1wk49Anw8YhZgSEWofR_w=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68515521/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tV8njL"&gt;Samsung’s president of mobile, TM Roh, dropped several hints about the company’s product roadmap in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences/"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt;. He confirmed Samsung will hold an event in January — presumably for the Galaxy S21. He also implied that S Pen support will come to more phones and that Samsung intends to broaden its line of folding phones with less expensive options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmD2cX"&gt;The hint that’s likely to have the biggest impact on the greatest number of customers is stylus support for Galaxy phones beyond the Note line. That’s been rumored for some time now, but Roh also claims that Samsung intends to “add some of its most well-loved features to other devices in our lineup.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SO4bJM"&gt;It may mean that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570706/samsung-galaxy-s21-phones-leaks-rumors"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; half of those rumors&lt;/a&gt; will also come to pass: that the Note line itself may soon be coming to an end, at least as a premium flagship in Samsung’s lineup. The Note hasn’t been that differentiated from the regular S line of phones for a while now. The main difference beyond design language has been that silo for the stylus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myzNol"&gt;With S Pen support on Galaxy S phones like the upcoming Galaxy S21 line and Z phones like the Z Fold (and maybe even a Z Flip), Samsung probably figures it’s just as easy to store a stylus in a case as it would be inside a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erjFhM"&gt;Roh also confirmed that Samsung will be providing more details in January. That’s when Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S21 line, a month or two ahead of when it usually does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi7h4T"&gt;The S Pen wasn’t the only thing Roh hinted at in the post. He also said that Samsung intends to have a “portfolio of foldables” and that it wants to make the category “more accessible to everyone.” “Accessible,” in this case, is likely a reference to the price of folding phones, which clock in anywhere from $1,300 to $2,000 for a new phone right now. The rumor here is that there will be a Z Fold “Lite” sometime in 2021. If folding phones are ever going to be more than a curiosity, they’ll need to come down significantly in price. That appears to be what Samsung is aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M05pch"&gt;Roh says that Samsung will put more emphasis on “pro-grade camera and video capabilities” on its phones. That’s not really much of a revelation, but it may mean that Samsung hopes to get back into a camera quality race with Apple and Google — a race Samsung has yet to definitively win. Roh promised an “epic new year” and specifically mentioned using AI to improve image quality. Computational photography is precisely where Samsung has traditionally fallen a little behind its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kamvqs"&gt;He hinted that it would begin to do more with UWB in 2021 as well. Like Apple, he’s promising that your phone will open your car door. Unlike Apple, he’s willing to talk about using it to locate objects and “even your family pet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZPygH"&gt;That’s a lot of teases for Samsung’s January event, which we currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;expect to happen on the 14th&lt;/a&gt;. That’s when we’ll see the Galaxy S21 announced and perhaps a bit more, an earlier start than usual to a new year of phones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter hit with €450,000 GDPR fine nearly two years after disclosing data breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-sdHrgDAFyYumTI7is5DAQK70E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68515495/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P8cOhF"&gt;Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined Twitter €450,000 (around $546,000) over a data breach it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187143/twitter-bug-android-protected-tweets-turned-off"&gt;disclosed back in January 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-twitter-inquiry"&gt;regulator announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The security flaw exposed some supposedly private tweets from the service’s Android users for over four years. Twitter was found to have violated the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) because it failed to notify the regulator within 72 hours of discovering the breach, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-fined-546-000-in-first-cross-border-gdpr-case-for-u-s-tech-firm-11608027373?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kTua2"&gt;The fine is notable because it’s the first time a US tech giant has been hit with a GDPR fine in a cross-border case, meaning one in which the Irish regulator consulted its EU counterparts as part of the decision. The investigation was headed by Ireland’s DPC because Ireland is where Twitter’s international headquarters are based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aUndob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter said it takes responsibility for the mistake&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dUBM9V"&gt;This cross-border process is part of the reason why it’s taken so long to issue this fine. Ireland’s DPC posted its draft decision back in May as part of the GDPR’s comments process. However, several other regulators raised objections to several points in its decision, which eventually led to a dispute-resolution process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yQgPE"&gt;One key objection raised was to the amount the DPC wanted to fine Twitter, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports. A fine of €450,000 is well short of the 2 percent of Twitter’s global annual revenue that can be levied under GDPR for failing to properly disclose a data breach. The Irish regulator originally wanted to fine Twitter even less than this, but through the dispute-resolution process, it was told to increase the amount. The DPC had argued for a smaller fine because it believed Twitter’s failing was through negligence, rather than being intentional or systematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cokao7"&gt;The fact that this dispute resolution took so long has led to criticism of GDPR’s effectiveness. The head of the Irish Data Protection Commission, Helen Dixon, has previously admitted that “the process didn’t work particularly well” but added that it’s the first time the process has been used and expressed optimism that it would get better in future, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8X8Uf"&gt;Responding to the fine in a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/"&gt;statement given to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter said it respects the regulator’s decision. “An unanticipated consequence of staffing between Christmas Day 2018 and New Years’ Day resulted in Twitter notifying the IDPC outside of the 72 hour statutory notice period,” the company said, “We have made changes so that all incidents following this have been reported to the DPC in a timely fashion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huMASZ"&gt;“We take responsibility for this mistake and remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and data of our customers,” the company added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9x4UV"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;describes the Twitter case as being “the first in a long pipeline” of cases involving US tech giants. Other open cases include more than a dozen that have been opened into Facebook and its subsidiaries, such as WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Advertising is complicated, but Melissa Grady is very good at it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQNBJA1Uzm3eADG_wBaw7yayw8M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68515491/VRG_ILLO_4318_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cadillac’s CMO on how tech is reshaping advertising &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Rv9dd0"&gt;Today’s episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; is a fun one, I promise: it’s about advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5K3bB"&gt;The modern ad industry is an enormous part of the economy that’s been completely reinvented by technology, that all of us experience every day, and to which most of us don’t pay any serious attention. And advertising is now also a data-intensive operation that has way more to do with technology and how it’s deployed than any of the &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;-era stereotypes we’re familiar with. When Mark Zuckerberg testifies to Congress that Facebook is free because it sells ads, what he’s really talking about is a massive ecosystem of data collection, user targeting, and sales tracking that operates in every corner of the tech industry. Facebook and Google have taken the old advertising cliche of finding the right customer at the right time at the right place and automated it at a vast scale that’s turned them into giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5dTbs"&gt;This shift has upended other traditionally ad-supported industries like the news media and television in ways no one ever really expected. On top of that, there’s an entire ecosystem of influencers who make all of their money doing brand deals — an entirely new approach to selling products on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3VjsJ"&gt;Now, if you’ve been following the tech industry, the broad strokes of what I just described are probably pretty familiar. But while we pay a lot of attention to Facebook and Google, the users of those services, and to influencers, we never really hear from the money — the people who actually &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; the ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NzGHtk"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP8256185465&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncFzU6"&gt;So I wanted to spend some time with Melissa Grady, the chief marketing officer of Cadillac, the person in charge of all of Cadillac’s advertising. Her job is to spend Cadillac’s marketing budget, and the way she spends it is fascinating. Her goal is to sell more Cadillacs, but she uses an enormous array of technology to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="uJYwlz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGcsSJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dujcEy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising is such a complicated subject that I actually started by asking Melissa to explain the absolute basics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dj5ti7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you buy an ad, and how do you measure what you’re paying for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cW6sZF"&gt;It goes back to: you figure out who your target is. You figure out where they are. And then you have an IO, which is an insertion order, and you fill it out and you say, I want to —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zppJVI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like on paper?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1rUHW"&gt;Electronically, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPbFhz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You just made a pen motion, so I was—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlCbvH"&gt;It’s funny that you say I did that because I was thinking about how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; automated that is, too much of the time. But, yeah. Then your ad runs. And then people come back and they say, “You were supposed to get X. You actually got Y.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g73z4V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the units of X and Y?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHAaT"&gt;Usually impressions, sometimes engagements, sometimes views. On YouTube we won’t buy impressions, we’ll buy views, because too many people are skipping, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlsA9b"&gt;If you were supposed to get X and Y is bigger, then everybody is happy. We’re all smiling. We’re all nodding, “Here’s how we’ll do it again.” And if Y was less than X, then we get what’s called a make-good or an ADU [Audience Deficiency Unit], and we go back and we say, “Okay, now because I said you were going to get a million and you got 700,000, I’m going to give you these three to four hundred thousand in these places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHuRHa"&gt;Sports have been interesting lately because coming back into sports I thought — I think we all thought — that sports were going to be through the roof. But the truth is, people haven’t been buying sports. So we bought some spots, like in the NBA Finals, and then got extra because not enough people had watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zm7wj2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I also asked Melissa to explain how she knows whether her ads are successful — after all, her goal is to sell more cars. But how can she know if a website banner ad is helping her more than a TV ad during an NFL game? It turns out that big advertisers will actually buy ad spots and then show things like public service announcements to a small group of people to create control groups — a base case to see if the people who saw the real ads actually reacted to them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1K7GE"&gt;For a TV ad, we actually will do studies with panels of people and ask them, “Do you remember seeing any of these ads? What did you like?” and we measure it that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cze9Tr"&gt;For digital or addressable [TV], we will hold out our control groups. We also have an overall model that we do that will tell us, “multi-line advertising works better than this, if you do this.” There’s just a lot of different ways that you experiment. And then sometimes you’re looking at what percent of people engaged with the ad, which is: they were given the opportunity [to engage]. Did they or did they not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1MW3g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I find all of this completely fascinating. This is how the money on the internet works now, and people like Melissa control the budgets that push and pull different parts of the tech industry in various ways. If you know me at all, you’d probably expect my conversation with the CMO of Cadillac to be mostly about the new Escalade. But really, we talked about data privacy and how Apple and Google’s plans to stop tracking people using cookies in web browsers will change the ad industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9oYTRd"&gt;
&lt;p id="jsp5jP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melissa Grady — you’re the CMO of Cadillac. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t83lDm"&gt;Thank you so much for having me. Very excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fW9gvm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am very excited to talk to you. I feel like so much of the culture of the internet, and really the world, runs on advertising, and it’s not really explored outside of [the] ad world. So I’m excited for you to help me understand it. You’re the CMO of Cadillac. That stands for chief marketing officer. You’ve had that job for a little bit over a year. Give me just a sense of your background. How does one become the CMO of Cadillac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWI89N"&gt;I think as far as CMOs go, I’m more of an interesting story, because I really grew up in data-driven marketing, and that has been my passion since I was in college. I am weirdly passionate about statistics. But also, I think why I’m in marketing and not doing something else is [that] I love the combination of right-brain and left-brain thinking. How do you take data and drive insight, which then drives really great creative [and] really great planning? All of those things [are] so important. It’s obvious because you can have the best data analysis in the world, but we use blank ads for control groups. We’re able to now do control groups when we do advertising, and when you run nothing, or you run public service announcements, you don’t see the results. So it’s not just about who you’re targeting. It’s how you’re connecting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRbJb1"&gt;Literally, that whole thing is my whole career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZRzcR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give me just the most basic rundown of what a CMO does every day. You wake up, how do you begin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHyaE7"&gt;It’s really funny because I get asked this question a lot. I cannot tell you a general day. It’s interesting because you move through so many different things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ai64Dr"&gt;Just today, I was in some future product meetings, and we’re talking about the future of Super Cruise and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;EV vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. We had a holiday luncheon. I played some trivia — that was a fun little aside. I’m sitting here doing a podcast with you, which is something I think I hadn’t really thought a lot about when I was thinking about what being a CMO would be. There is this side of doing different presentations, being on a stage sometimes, that I think was an interesting aspect I hadn’t thought as much about. And then, obviously, a ton of time on brand campaigns, on targeting strategies, on those kinds of things that we think about when we think about marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbGP2c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some decisions you have to make? What does your decision set look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HibkR"&gt;Again, it’s across the board. It really touches everything, and I think anything that touches the customer is something that marketing is either putting input into or making decisions on. What is the customer experience of the future, how are people going to seamlessly shop? What are our digital experiences? What commercial’s going to be on TV? Who’s going to be the lead in the commercial? [It’s] all of those things, and it’s broader than I would have thought it was going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjlCeB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ask everybody for their decision-making framework — how they think about making decisions. You’ve worked in a bunch of different industries. Data-driven advertising and targeting is a new way of thinking about it. What is your framework? How has it evolved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zd6ky"&gt;Probably not surprising — it’s very heavily reliant on data. When I look at things and make decisions, I like to have a lot of data, and I think my brain starts to categorize things. I like statistics, and that works for me. I tend to almost plot things out. I can give you a very random example that has nothing to do with cars or my career, but will explain how I start to make decisions and understand things. I take things apart, and then I put them back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="M7ZuDC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E4NZqb"&gt;A good example of this is [that] I really like wine, and there are some wines that I like better than others. I don’t know how to describe them. So I started asking — when I would like a wine, I would have the sommelier or someone who understands wine describe it to me. What I understood and what I started to see was, there are certain words that are repeated in this. I like “earthy.” I like “spicy,” sometimes a little “leather.” I don’t know, actually, what any of those things mean, but I know that I like them because I’ve seen the frequency of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vjLti"&gt;So that’s how my brain works. When we look at any decision that I’m making on a regular day, the first thing I want to know is, “Who’s the customer? Who’s it going to impact? What’s important to them, or how do they see things?” Then I will ask all of my direct reports, “Tell me what you think about this.” I gather the information. My brain parses it out, and then I’m like, “Okay, here I go. This is what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpk8xG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think a lot of people think of advertising in this &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mad Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; context of creatives and brand campaigns and photoshoots. You have what seems like a very data-driven job, essentially a tech job. Is that how you think of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAEvIC"&gt;Yeah, definitely. I absolutely do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KMkrf"&gt;What’s very funny is my late grandfather was basically&lt;em&gt; Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;. He was in advertising in the ’50s. He was a very successful photographer, and so we used to trade a lot of notes. I think he was fascinated by how things have really kind of come along and changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op3kIC"&gt;Underpinning any good marketing strategy today, you need a really strong technology and analytics strategy, and you still need the good creative. But I think that once you get to a good insight, which is really data or research-driven, that’s when you can really get to good creative. And I love technology and how things work and are put together and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MudgRF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So at the really basic nuts and bolts level of it, you have a big ad budget. Cadillac does not skimp on its ad budget. You have a big chunk of money, and you decide how to spend it on things like TV advertising, on podcast ads, on radio spots, print, digital.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfzmiM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The flip side of it — the part I want to explore — is there’s an entire economy based on people like you spending that money. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; itself is supported by advertising, by and large. Broadcast television for years and years and years. Now it’s shifting to streaming, but still, the engine of the television industry is advertising.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P18Tz1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Print magazines [are] collapsing because those ads don’t perform as well as they used to, because no one reads print. Do you think about the flip side of your job when you spend those dollars, that advertising powers the culture in that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9R7JT"&gt;Yeah, it is an interesting thing. I think about it a lot, and there’s a few different examples I can give. One of the things I’m thinking a lot about now and that my team hears me say a lot is [that] the world’s going cookieless, and everyone is sort of freaking out about cookies going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8loxf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you explain what a cookie is in this context?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwD6jm"&gt;The easiest way to know what a cookie is: it’s a digital identifier of who you are. It’s something that as you go around the internet, follows you as a little piece of code. If you go back to a website that you’ve been to before and it recognizes you, that’s because of a cookie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRnwmI"&gt;The flip side of that is, you were shopping for a Christmas present for your husband, and now he’s getting ads for it on his computer because you’re on the same Wi-Fi system. That’s all because of cookies, and it’s really about how we anonymously track people on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDyV72"&gt;So we’re moving away from cookies and there’s this whole deprecation of cookies and what that’s going to mean for advertisers. Everyone knows that advertisers are targeting people, and we’re looking at who we target. That’s how we do it today. I am very concerned about how we deal with that in the short term. But my response to that is, look, we’ve seen this before, and what we’re going to see right now is a ton of innovation, because advertising is where the money is. If that money will go away because cookies have gone away, you have a lot of smart people and you have money involved. Innovation is going to start happening on how we approach and address that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV3cFU"&gt;There’s some early indications of how that could change. First-party [data] becomes more important, how you’re matching first-party [data] to first-party data. But this is where, over the next year and a half, we’re going to see a lot of innovation, because, to your point, a lot of things are run by advertising, and no one’s going to let that just go away. No one’s going to let that not work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khdO2s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked some people in my part of the ad world what I should talk to you about, and one of the first things that came up was cookieless. The phrase they used was “cookiepocalypse,” which I thought was very good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL3Nk8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically, what you’re saying is [that] Apple is being &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very aggressive with Safari&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on the iPhone, and on the Mac, to stop tracking. Then Google is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;supposed to do it in 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I think they’re a little bit more worried about antitrust stuff because they control a browser and they’re already in trouble. But you’re saying the primary mechanism of ad targeting is going away. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aQBmM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said first-party. What do you mean by first-party?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ldcCH"&gt;There’s a few different ways to break this down, but now when you go onto a website, you have to accept if they’re going to track you or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh4TPV"&gt;What we don’t realize is how much we appreciate advertising. As you have to start to pay for more and more subscriptions and you realize how much advertising was fueling, I think people are going to start to [realize], “Oh my gosh. Now I’m paying $200 a month for all these different TV subscription services. But if I let Hulu give me ads and I let Sling give me ads, then that’s going to go down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhQTNL"&gt;What’s going to happen is people are going to understand the exchange a little bit more. But that means you’re going to realize why and where you appreciate cookies and being tracked. For example, if you have to go to a website and you have to keep filling out the same five questions and it’s something that you go to three times a week, you want them to remember you because you get tired of having to answer the same thing. You’re going to start to say, “Oh, yeah, please. Here’s my cookie. Take my information, but let me understand how you’re sharing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjuNA7"&gt;So having visibility into how people are sharing things is going to become more important. When we have information about people, and people have said, “Yep, when it’s serving me, you can share it,” as an advertiser, that’s your first-party data. Someone has said, “Here’s my information.” You order something, you fill out a form, or you say, “Please remember me.” That’s your first-party data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgVxLW"&gt;If I have a million people who have signed up to hear about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac LYRIQ&lt;/a&gt; and want information, that’s my first-party data. If I think that a website that talks about electric cars might have a good list that we want to talk to, that’s third-party data. Today, a lot of the internet runs on third-party data, or people using other people’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EaRWy"&gt;How you use your data and are talking or matching with other people, I think that’s going to become the way. So when I say I’m less worried about cookies — and trust me, I’m worried about them — it’s because we’re learning new ways to combine the data we have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esxV9q"&gt;From an advertising perspective, our agency Dentsu has a platform called M1, which is like Experian for ad data. We don’t ever see that data and it’s anonymized, but we do know who we want to target or work with. Dentsu goes out to people who they have relationships with, who they know are safe, then we start to target based off that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WFlU0"&gt; A lot of it will go back to how advertising used to be, way back, like, “Okay, you have a good audience. I’m going to talk to you. Here’s who I want.” People are going to have a lot more control, and in the end, I think we’ll all end up in a better place, because when it comes down to it, I don’t really want to talk to everyone, and I surely don’t want to be spamming people. So as we get to this better place, I think we’re just going to have to be a lot more specific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EODx1R"&gt;There’s the old adage that marketers always love to talk about, Wanamaker’s dilemma: “I know 50 percent of my advertising is wasted. I just don’t know which 50 percent.” Well, I think we’re getting to a point where you’re going to have more specific relationships, and that problem’s not going to be a thing anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfCoof"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me zoom you all the way out. I feel like I could fall down that rabbit hole with you for the next hour, but let me pull this all the way back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2xJwx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cadillac just introduced a new Escalade. It’s very fancy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126299/escalade-2021-oled-display-touchscreen-curved-glass"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It has a 38-inch OLED screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; It’s got &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18515802/cadillac-super-cruise-ct5-ny-auto-show-2019"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Cruise self-drive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I’ve configured this thing 50 times on your website. I can’t get it to be under $100,000. So you’ve got a $100,000 super truck that you’re selling people. You’re the person in charge of marketing it. How do you start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3adrW4"&gt;The first thing we start with is data. Who are the current Escalade owners? We did some modeling on those people to understand who were the new potential Escalade owners. Then we got into the insight portion of it. There’s some things that are very true about Cadillac, and then there’s some things that are very true about Escalade because Escalade is the same, but different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VssCuU"&gt;So when you get to the insight of who is “a Cadillac person,” it’s so fascinating. When you go into our database of owners, the thing that indexes probably the highest is someone’s job title — the job title that indexes the highest is president or CEO. The reason for that is because we’ve got a bunch of entrepreneurs and self-made people. People who push themselves, who have started low. They’ve worked their whole lives, they’ve gotten to a certain point and they reward themselves with a Cadillac. If you go all the way back to Motown, there’s stories that as soon as you got a hit record, you got a Cadillac. And that feeling of reward and entrepreneurship and that type of person who’s drawn to it is very consistent across Cadillac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U12dw3"&gt;Now, as we look at the Escalade our campaign is called, “Never stop arriving.” Regina King is the person who is featured in our ad for the Cadillac. And the reason that we’ve been working with her is we wrote a manifesto earlier in the year that really resonated with her. She was like, “Look, you guys are really talking about me.” When you get down to it, Cadillac represents the American Dream. If I want it and I work hard enough, I can get there. And so when we wrote this manifesto and Regina was introduced to it, she was like, “That’s my story. I started as an extra, then I had a TV show, then I was in some movies.” You may have heard of &lt;em&gt;Jerry Maguire&lt;/em&gt;, but [she’s] not the main character. Then she’s an Oscar-winning actress who’s now a director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7aSnB1"&gt;We went with “Never stop arriving” because this person who gets success doesn’t lean on their success and say, “Hey, here I am.” They’re like, “Now, what am I going to do next? How am I going to keep making the world better? How am I going to keep making myself better?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HitfMx"&gt;That’s a lot of background on how we got to “Never stop arriving.” So now we know what we want to do with this campaign, and the basics of how we go about marketing that is with our data and our insight. The third piece is, show up differently. Innovate. When you look at our Escalade campaign, we ran some TV ads, we know where our audience is there. And that’s obvious, here’s the data, here’s the output. We run our ads in digital, in addressable, very heavily—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYk9oO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you mean by “addressable”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dx48Hm"&gt;Much like digital ad buys, addressable TV is targeted. You have regular broadcast TV [and] addressable is where we know who is watching. There’s a subscriber base, so you know who’s watching something, and then we can deliver relevant ads so that we can select an audience. You select an audience, you target them. If you and I are sitting in two different apartments in New York, you may see a different ad than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3PGAj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is like the holy grail of television advertising. I’ve heard this talked about for a long time. I’m watching Hulu, they know who I am, they’re going to serve me a different ad than you. You’re saying that’s already happening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkFHX8"&gt;Absolutely. We’ve shifted a good portion of our budget this year into addressable. To get away from Escalade for a minute, addressable TV actually really helped save us during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZmU0t"&gt;If you want to talk about the beauty of addressable, we were able to do this: No. 1, we stopped production, as did everyone else, so we don’t have a lot of inventory. No. 2, we know how regional COVID was. So while New York was shut down, there were parts of the country that hadn’t yet been affected. And No. 3, we knew what our incentive structure was and our inventory. We know inventory, we know how people are feeling, and we know incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iu1phr"&gt;We were then able to, on a market by market basis, say, “Here’s the messaging we’re going to have in New York, and it’s all about, ‘We have your back.’” People don’t need to see any kind of fun advertising right now. I think in the beginning of the pandemic, all of us marketers had the somber advertising. You had to do it and it worked really well then. The beauty of addressable is [that] I think we all know the moment we were done with that kind of advertising. Every two weeks we were updating our creative and we were able to figure out region by region, what creative to play where, based on how people were feeling, what they were going through, and what our inventory was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbihCZ"&gt;So in New York, we might be saying, “Health care workers, we can help you with a car purchase discount, and here’s what we have,” versus in Texas, we might still be running an XT6 ad because people were still living a lot more normally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE35A2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s incredible. So how do you track that? Because underlying all of this, all of your data collection, is a sense that you’re collecting all the data because you can see how well this stuff works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qICw7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me just offer the simplest example so we can hook onto something that everybody can understand. We read ads on this podcast. I say, “Go to this website, use ‘Decoder’ as your promo code.” I know that advertiser is tracking how many times people use the promo code. That’s how they measure, in just the most brute force way, if their ad on this podcast was effective. You’re obviously not having people in Texas use a promo code— &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDNBpM"&gt;Walk in the dealer and say “Decoder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VW1gXI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I mean, if you want to do it, let’s innovate. But I’m curious, when you’ve got your fancy addressable ads running on different markets with different campaigns, how are you tracking what’s effective and what’s actually turning into the sale of an Escalade?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8xICr"&gt;We’re tracking sales. That’s the beauty of addressable. What we do is, if we, say, have two million people in a market that we want to target, we’ll hold out a control group. And there’s a lot of syndicated data that we’ll look at. There’s a lot of syndicated data on who bought a vehicle. Again, using this privacy-safe environment that we have, we build out this segment, we hold out a control group, and then we go back and we look, how many people purchased overall, how many people in the control group purchased, and what’s our difference? What’s the lift? So for someone who loves statistics, experiments, and data, it’s pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbu260"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask you another really, really basic threshold question, which I think every generation goes through. Does advertising work? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkIEMf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The audience can’t see Melissa, but she started vigorously saying yes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Laughs]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IatTwE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what I mean is, you’re measured, I think, at the simplest level, on whether sales went up or not. Right? You do a bunch of stuff, you collect your data, you spend the money on marketing. At the end of the day, the CEO of Cadillac is like, “Did it work? Did we sell more Cadillacs than we would if we hadn’t done anything else?” Or is there something else you’re measured on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8E7lNv"&gt;In the end, it all comes down to sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THEySA"&gt;Of course, we also look at brand opinion. We track things like that, opinion and consideration, and I’ll divert for a second and say why that’s important. There was a third-party study done during the recession. And it was looking at how brands went down and then bounced back, and they separated it based on having a strong, an average, or a low opinion and consideration from consumers. And brands that had a stronger opinion stayed high longer and bounced back faster. So there’s actually data behind why opinion matters. It can feel a little soft when you talk about it. But for me, again, I’ve got to peel things back, I’ve got to understand the data. This is why I’m okay with opinion and consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8tWL2"&gt;But does advertising work? It definitely does. We all think about advertising as annoying, and it is sometimes, but people actually love advertising. A few examples of that are—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtHYRv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every ad person says this to me, by the way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsZm8s"&gt;Yeah. I’ll give you some examples of things I’ve done, and then I’ll just give you the basic one. How many people are so excited on Super Bowl Sunday to see all the ads? That’s good advertising. When advertising is good, we don’t mind it. As we go back to Escalade — and I’ll finish up how I come up with that plan — we start to look for different activations and consider, “how are we going to show up differently?” So we’re going to run the TV ads. The TV ad features Regina. It shows Super Cruise really well, shows the speakers. It’s very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNodpv"&gt;But we have a lot of different activations. In one of them, we sponsored James Blake’s new song. We had a contest to find his best fans. We drove them to a hangar out in LA. He performed for them, and we “gave” a first listen of that new song to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8IiiU"&gt;So the Cadillac messaging within there: it showed off the features of the vehicle pretty well, but it wasn’t a “sponsored by Cadillac” ad. But everyone who watched that new song knows that Cadillac has a new Escalade.  30 million people who watched that video online enjoyed that experience. And now they know about Cadillac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mclISY"&gt;I always try to be additive to an experience and less interruptive, and that’s why good creative and good insight is so important. Because if a commercial is really funny or good, we don’t mind it as much. I’m not saying we love them, but the more that you can do things that make it interesting, the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BM3iyo"&gt;For instance, podcasting.  We’ve been experimenting a lot with podcast advertising. And for the Escalade, one of the things we did was add an Escalade Visualizer to one of the podcast players we had. So as you’re listening, you could play around with the Escalade. And we had a “roadblock” where our segment heard Regina before the podcast, and then we had this ad in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2e4Ur"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to say what a roadblock is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhjwVE"&gt;Oh, good call. A roadblock is where every single person within a period of time experiences whatever your advertising is. The way that used to be is you would go to a homepage like Yahoo.com and you’d see a big ad that was there for a day or two. That’s a roadblock. For an audience, if there’s a certain audience that you’re buying, only those people will experience that ad when they get there. So, this was an audience roadblock of Regina talking about the Escalade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSU5pP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You and I are talking on the day that the government is suing to break up Facebook. They filed the lawsuit 20 minutes before we got on the air. You’ve talked a lot about data and tracking and making sure you’re converting into actual sales of a car.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxkkHn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When most people think about data and the internet and tracking, they think about Google and Facebook. We have endless conversations about privacy. First, you are talking about an awful lot of data and an awful lot of tracking, so I’m curious how you’re thinking about privacy. And then in the context of Google and Facebook, they have the most data, but they’re not the first place &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you’d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; think of necessarily. I don’t think of Cadillac advertising showing up on Facebook, for example. So, I’m curious how you think about those two platforms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jE9COx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with privacy. You have talked a lot about data and tracking. How do you think about privacy? I mean, tracking is what the industry runs on right now, the advertising industry. So, how are you thinking about that evolving?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAFnff"&gt;I look at how I’ve grown in my thinking on this over the past 10 years. I’m a data geek, and what we were all talking about for the past 20 years is when we can actually specifically target people, when we can get the right person with the right message at the right time, we’re going to know and we’re going to be able to track it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKGqnx"&gt;10 years ago or so, when some of this really started to come to fruition, I was very excited, and I was full force, “How do we work with this partner? How do we do that?” As you started to see how different people were using data, or see people not understanding what they were opting into, I think then I started to realize, “Hey, we need to be really careful here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQScQp"&gt;And I will say from a GM perspective, on anything that’s safety-related, we are going to be as careful as possible, whether it’s with a person’s life or advertising. We want people to be safe. And that extends to their data and their privacy. It’s interesting, at GM, we start every meeting with a safety message. And when I first joined, I was like, “Oh, that’s going to be weird.” But actually, it’s something that Mary [Barra, chair and CEO of GM]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;came up with while she’s been here: “how do we really take safety personally and do it every day?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh2Lt1"&gt;One thing is, we share personal stories. Someone will tell a story like, “I was putting up my Christmas lights and I fell off a ladder, so be really careful.” Or “I saw someone who got in a terrible car crash from texting and driving, so let’s remember, don’t walk around looking at your phone.” All these little things really start to ingrain into your own brain and to the GM culture. So, when we talk about people’s data and privacy, as much as I personally think it’s really important, GM also is trying to set [the] highest of standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9C3LXM"&gt;As we talk about having people understand what they’re opting into, having different levels of control and only working with partners where we know what’s going on is important. Now with our agency, they’ve been through the highest levels of clearance and we know how they’re doing everything, and on top of that, they anonymize their data. So it’s this safety net around people. As excited as I was 10 years ago, now I think there’s a big responsibility that we have. There’s a lot of money at stake, which sometimes leads to not the best behavior in certain people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU94F8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think Facebook and Google have been as responsible as GM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbfF4h"&gt;I think that there are very public examples of Facebook learning some lessons. I don’t know as many examples of Google. I think within Google’s own ecosystem there’s more visibility into what’s going on. As it started to be clear what could happen, they really locked it down. So I think they’re probably learning too, they’re on a journey as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcgxWT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That leads me into talking about platforms and how you think about platform advertising, and broadly, what you think it’s good for. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XoZpR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We spend a lot of time covering YouTube and Instagram. They have ad formats. They’re big, valuable businesses for those companies. Do you think that advertising, those formats, are as effective for you as addressable TV or print advertising or the NFL, or wherever else you are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTQeHC"&gt;Absolutely. When we talk about being additive to an experience and making sure that what we’re doing is relevant in the experience, it’s a lot of buzzwords, but it extends to online platforms, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scGd5K"&gt;We have something called Cadillac Live. Cadillac Live is a showroom that we have in Canada, where all of our vehicles are there and people can dial in on basically a one-way Zoom or video call and have their own auto show specialists describe the vehicle to them. It’s pretty cool. And in the pandemic, it really saved us because as people couldn’t go into showrooms, they could just dial into Cadillac Live. On Instagram, we do [a] broadcast from Cadillac Live. And we had one a couple of weeks ago where the lead product person on Escalade was showing the first Escalade versus the current. And then we boosted it so that more people could have the opportunity to see it. That’s really good advertising on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5cs1R"&gt;YouTube is the same. I try to be very careful on YouTube because the easy thing to do is to take your TV commercial, cut it down to 15 seconds and run it on YouTube. I think that’s really annoying to people watching YouTube. So I’m trying to find ways that we do more interesting things. For example, with the XT6 launch, we actually had six-second videos. It’s amazing how quickly you can get a point across in six seconds. We ran those on YouTube. Instead of someone having to watch a whole video, they’re like, “Oh, that’s cute,” and then they’re on their way. What I try to do is make it more fun for people, so that they actually enjoy it. Each platform has its benefits, but YouTube and Instagram are great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSL1Y0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you think about those formats, I always wonder what advertisers think of the “skip ad” button on YouTube, which is YouTube’s great innovation for users. They only have to sit through four seconds before you can skip the ad. My instinct is that everybody skips the ad. Does that bother you? Does that work for you? Am I totally wrong? Do people sit through the ads?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T57AXy"&gt;People do [skip] a lot actually, but that’s always my challenge to the creative team. You have three seconds. What are you going to do in those three seconds that’s going to make someone not skip and if they do, to make sure that they got the message? So that’s just how we look at it. But it is interesting how many people actually watch the ads. You’d think you want to skip it, but if it’s interesting enough, you don’t. That’s our challenge as marketers. We’ve got to step up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2RQ28"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube has frequent “adpocalypses” where they demonetize creators or they’ve got a moderation problem. Over the summer we saw organizations like Sleeping Giants come at big advertisers and say, “You gotta walk away from Facebook. You have to walk away from Fox News.” In the context of where we started, the idea that advertising funds culture, does that stuff hit you? Do you think, okay, YouTube is a little crazy right now. I’m going to pull those dollars away until they figure out whatever controversy is happening right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvoBSS"&gt;So I’ll give you a “yes and” answer on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tetQmU"&gt;If there’s something that we feel is misaligned with our brand, we don’t want to be there. And so, as we advertise, we have really strong inclusion and exclusion lists of sites, content, and other things like that. And whenever we’re made aware of a problem, I don’t want to be there because I don’t want Cadillac to stand for that. Cadillac has a lot of meaning. And we’re very careful about what our brand means. It’s got a long history, and it’s a history of inclusion and standing up for people, and helping people who want to help themselves. That’s strong and powerful and I can’t ruin that by being in the wrong place. I think sometimes we have to stand up in whatever format that we’re willing to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqssfv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the mechanic of that? Do you get a text and then you pick up the phone and you’re like, “Susan, pull my ads off YouTube.” How does that actually work? That’s what I imagine — you’ve got a red phone to the CEO of YouTube and you’re always just yelling at them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVDBfs"&gt;What’s funny is, you’re not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHIeLH"&gt;What happens, if something runs where it shouldn’t, [is] you start getting texts and IMs, or you have an angry customer that writes in. It’s amazing how many people will write in and tell you their opinions. But yeah, something like that will happen. And then we will go back and say, what happened? We’re not supposed to be there, so how did this get there? Or if it’s something new, then it’s like, “Get it off now. We’re not going to be part of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG2xsz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I wanted to ask you about was influencer marketing. And the reason I’m asking about controversial content is, influencers broadly are an entrepreneurial bunch. I think the influencer and creator economy is amazing. The platforms have enabled it. But there’s still a lot of 25-year-old millionaires out there. And to me, the idea that we’re going to give the keys to a $100,000 super truck to a 25-year-old millionaire seems very risky. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vO8wfy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much influencer marketing do you do? How effective do you think it is? Is there a parking lot full of wrecked XT6s somewhere? How do you manage the cost of that, versus the reward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1i3cf"&gt;A few things on that: we know what we stand for. We know what our values are. And our influencers are very well aligned with that. So like Regina King— &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3m2eEI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You think of Regina King as an influencer? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkfM0g"&gt;I guess, yes and no. I think there’s influencers who are just people, who by definition have a large social following and a large presence in the world. And then there are the YouTube stars, right? We’re not giving a lot of YouTube stars cars, no. Someone like Regina King, I don’t worry about her. I think she stands for a lot of good things in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dx7tF"&gt;One of the influencers that we do work with is John Henry, who is in his 20s. I’m not worried about what he’s going to do, because he’s someone who stands for the right things. He’s very aligned with us. He’s a young entrepreneur. We recorded the show &lt;em&gt;Hustle&lt;/em&gt; with him about a year and a half ago, and we’ve just remained partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nPkwc"&gt;Another one is Melissa Butler from The Lip Bar. She started The Lip Bar and she’s pretty awesome. She was on Wall Street and realized, “I’m doing the wrong thing,” and started Lip Bar. And I think she had to deal with a lot of people questioning her before she was successful, like “How could you leave such a good job?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZLbem"&gt;But when you have people like that, who are strong-willed people who want to do better in their life. People who are striving to be the best version of themselves, then I think they’re less likely to do the stuff you described. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SU68ZY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step out of your Cadillac role for a second and into your “thinking about the advertising industry” role. Do you think influencer marketing is successful? Is it growing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2xPD9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because when I think about YouTubers and I think about Instagram stars, they don’t make any money from the platform. The average YouTuber is getting checks from YouTube, AdSense and their partner programs, but the real money comes from the brand deals they make. The real money comes from the products they endorse or the integrations they have. Maybe Cadillac isn’t doing it as directly, but do you see it working as another category of advertising that is competitive with television, digital, and all the other stuff?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62Oi52"&gt;I think in the right categories, it is. I have a 16-year-old niece, if she sees someone who she’s watching on YouTube all the time and they’re talking about Lip Bar lipsticks, then she’s going to be like, “Oh, Lip Bar is really cool.” So when you’re in a category like that, that is, a more accessible product and not a big purchase, it works. I think it’s a lot harder with a $100,000 Escalade to have that influence with those people. Although I will say, when some of the car people on YouTube we talk to review a car, like CT5-Vs we’ve given to some, it definitely works. So I think there’s different levels and ways into it, but overall, yeah, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV2rpZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cadillac is moving into EVs. It’s a big shift. I know it’s not without its controversies and challenges, but you’re doing it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0vQ4G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arguably the biggest influencer in [the] car world is Elon Musk. Tesla does not do any marketing besides Twitter accounts and stunts. Have you ever thought about making Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, a Twitter maniac? Have you ever thought about taking Rory Harvey, who’s the CEO of Cadillac, and just letting him loose on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfmwJY"&gt;I’ll say yes and no. The thing about it is-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzLUB5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What percentage “yes,” to go loose on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGjkkd"&gt;I would love for Rory to have a really strong social media presence. The thing about it is that no one at GM is going to be the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ93h3"&gt;Let me just give you an example of how it’s different: when Elon will say something and then stock prices go up or tank, it’s a weird luxury that they have that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4gvSr"&gt;At GM, you can’t have that same sort of discourse on a social media platform. I think that Mary is incredible, and as much as we are able to get her voice out into the world, that’s great. I just think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439374/gm-unveils-ultium-drive-family-of-electric-motors"&gt;how we approach EVs&lt;/a&gt; is going to be very, very different than the Elon Musk effect, which is incredible, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3DGyf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you think about all the tools that we’ve talked about, there is digital advertising across platforms, there’s digital advertising across publications. There’s addressable TV, there’s influencer marketing. There’s four-second ads on YouTube that make you keep watching the whole thing. There’s a litany of formats. You’ve got to shift the perception of Cadillac to being an EV maker against Tesla. What’s your plan? How do you use all those tools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bytyb"&gt;You’re going to hate this answer, but we’re going to have to use all those tools. I think next year is the year for us to get our story out because the way that we’re approaching EV and the way that we’re creating these vehicles is pretty incredible. It’s a matter of getting that story out, GM’s “zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion” vision, and how Cadillac fits into that vision. Some of that is going to be through influencers or experts talking about saving the world. And some of that will be talking about our new features like Super Cruise. Super Cruise, for anyone who doesn’t know, is our hands-free driving. We are actually the first hands-free driving in the automotive industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1nwOS"&gt;We like to talk about the Super Cruise effect. Basically, there’s a moment where you’re in this car, you push a button and you take your hands off the wheel, and you almost can’t breathe. You’re like, “Is this car going to keep turning around the curves of the road and going 60 miles per hour and keep me safe?” And it works. And then you’re just like, “Wow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALeO3H"&gt;So it’s telling that story of what our technology is and can do. Like AR nav. I drive an Escalade and I can often see the road better in my AR nav than I can on the road itself because it’s so intense on the OLED screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLZsM7"&gt;Or things like night vision, that’s another cool one. I have a place in the mountains. There was a deer that was coming towards the road as I was driving up and I saw it with night vision, which I wouldn’t have seen otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BospfD"&gt;As we start to tell these technology stories, I think people will start to understand. So it’s going to have to be firing on all channels next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ietlv9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You named a bunch of technologies, some of them are directly competitive with Tesla. Do you think you have to make the direct comparison and say, we’re better than Tesla’s self-driving stuff? Do you have to ignore it? Yes, you’ve got to use all these tools. But inside of those places, do you tailor the message and say, “We want to get people who are considering a Tesla to consider us, and here, we’re making that direct comparison”? Or is it a little broader and just saying, “Hey, look at how cool this is?” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r988v1"&gt;Yeah, it’s a little broader. I’m not taking anything away from Tesla’s innovation. I think it’s amazing what they’ve done, and very different from where we are. When you look at EV being about 1 percent or so of the auto market now — or under 5 percent, let’s say — then there’s a lot of room there for both of us. I think the trajectory of EV growth is going to be huge. Once we get the infrastructure, once we have the products, and once people consider the changes in the world, I think all of those will be motivation to consider what we’re offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfGJMq"&gt;Things like that [are] going to drive EV adoption. We’re going to have amazing products at exactly the right time. Yeah, I don’t need to go say, “This is better.” Other publications will tell you our self-driving’s better. I don’t need to—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39c6uc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where’s my fleet of influencer Escalades? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMFqyc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that I’ve been doing [on] episodes of Decoder that has really stood out to me, is having guests tell me various trends that have been dramatically accelerated by the pandemic. And one of the biggest trends is e-commerce. Obviously, everyone’s shopping from home. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA7BMU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t sell what I would think of as an e-commerce-friendly product. I don’t think you’re going to sell Escalades on Amazon anytime soon, but has that accelerated for you? Is that something you’re thinking about — we should make it easier to just buy a car from home? GM is a big company, lots of dealers, lots of relationships. Is that something you can just move? Or is that something that has accelerated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxiCBz"&gt;This is one of the things that I think of when we look at silver linings that came out of the pandemic. I think in automotive it was very hard to change consumer behavior. You buy a car by going into the dealership and you expect to do it a certain way. And what the pandemic really gave us was the gift of being able shift things. GM has an e-commerce platform. It’s called Shop Click Drive, and it’s integrated in with our dealers. Usage on that was lower before, just because consumers didn’t really want to engage with us that way. They wanted to go in and haggle with the finance manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTbfPd"&gt;I talked before about Cadillac Live and how we’re changing how people shop that way. We are, I think, where some automotive companies saw higher acceptance of existing products, I think we were able to actually pull up some of our in-development things that weren’t supposed to come out until next year. We sped up the development of them. And we’ve seen big shifts in the way that people buy cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMvmcg"&gt;It always culminates in the dealer. Our dealers are one of our best assets. But how we let the dealers best use their time can change. If someone wants to look at Cadillac Live, find out about all these vehicles, and then look on Shop Click Drive online and see how much that costs, then they can have a very good, educated conversation with the dealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiLz2P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many cars have you sold where people click a button and the car just shows up? Is that something you can do yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQUH1R"&gt;“Click a button and the car shows up” happens more than you think. Someday, the car will be able to drive itself there when it’s done. But what is happening now is concierge service. If you want to get your car serviced, you can call the dealer and they will come pick it up. They can drop off a loaner if you need it too. The same thing happens with delivering a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXz5yF"&gt;There are some states where you can’t do it, but there are a lot of examples where a consumer could configure the whole deal online. They would then talk to someone to arrange delivery. And they come and sign and take the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEP86u"&gt;I had the delivery service. One of my cars needed servicing while we were at home. And it was pretty crazy to just sit in your house, get up from a meeting, give someone your keys. He disinfects them, goes and gets in the car, and a couple of hours later your car’s back. It was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6D6wY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for Cadillac as you think about marketing the brand next year? After the pandemic, people are maybe not going to want to look at screens so much as we all have for the past year. Do you think you need to make a shift in how advertising works again, post-we’re all locked inside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGLXB0"&gt;You are asking me my biggest question. And not only just for next year when I think we want to look at screens less. I think that when we just look at this year, we know behavior is totally shifting. People are gaming now. We’re experimenting in gaming. People are not watching sports anymore. So, how that behavior is changing and what people are going to do is my biggest question. But I definitely want to be there hopefully helping them make that experience better, in a safe way, as it changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8tEDQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a data person, what’s the biggest signal to you about changing behavior right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UZLkjD"&gt;I probably just gave two of the bigger examples. Looking at sports ratings being down so much, that was really a surprise to me. Gaming being so big right now, I think what was amazing was how many people found a sense of community through gaming. I think those are two of the bigger things right now that I’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The endless march through an endless March&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sGr19A"&gt;I’m told that March lasted 31 days this year, just like it did last year. Each of those days supposedly had 24 hours, like every other day this year, and that those hours each held the same number of minutes. The seconds allegedly ticked by, methodically, one by one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfFhf4"&gt;The calendar for 2020 is made up of uniform blocks, but that’s not what my mental map of the year looks like. In my head, the year looks like the calendar version of a homunculus — a distorted version of the human body, where each part is sized based on how much of the brain is devoted to controlling it. The hands on a homunculus are enormous, and the elbow is disproportionately miniature. In my mental map of the year, the summer is compressed and small; the week of the election balloons off the page; and March swells to crowd out February, April, and May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXwZkU"&gt;March is when the full weight of the COVID-19 pandemic first settled on the United States. Watching the virus take hold was sudden and scary, and watching the world snap shut was disorienting. March set the tone for a year characterized by uncertainty, confusion, stress, and anxiety — all of which mess with the way we experience the passage of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zzgh60"&gt;

&lt;p id="G4wzfL"&gt;“It’s very common for people in the midst of a traumatic experience to report that they feel like time is slowing down or stopping,” says Alison Holman, who studies trauma and time perception at the University of California, Irvine. “All of a sudden, everything is just at a snail’s pace.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TeupY"&gt;Many people who are in &lt;a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2017.00032#ref1"&gt;accidents&lt;/a&gt; like car crashes say that the incident felt longer than it actually was. First-time &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16860291/"&gt;skydivers&lt;/a&gt; who report high levels of fear before their jump say that they feel like they’re falling for longer than divers who are less scared. Those anecdotes are backed up by more objective experiments: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5529171/"&gt;researchers show&lt;/a&gt; that when people see &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20971168/"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; in the lab for the same amount of time, they still think that they’re looking at scary images (like of snakes) for longer than they’re looking at neutral images. People given a mild shock between two clicks of a stopwatch think the stretch of time covered is longer than people who don’t get the shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DsMENA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Emotions distort perceptions of time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O3hDRG"&gt;“Emotions distort perceptions of time,” says Kyla Rankin, who studies uncertainty and well-being in the University of California, Riverside department of psychology. A network of regions in the brain govern how we feel the seconds tick by, and researchers are starting to understand how the &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/the-fluidity-of-time"&gt;circuits involved&lt;/a&gt; in feelings like surprise, fear, or stress &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/reasons-revealed-for-the-brains-elastic-sense-of-time-20200924/"&gt;interact with them&lt;/a&gt;. While the mechanics are still under investigation, the subjective experience is more well known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpAbPa"&gt;Rankin, for instance, tracks disturbances in how people perceive time over longer stretches than are covered in lab experiments — months, rather than minutes — by following college students waiting for exam results or lawyers waiting to find out if they passed the bar exam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zsy8HC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We all now exist in a single, long day in Pandemic Standard Time that started in January and is still going on.&lt;/p&gt;— Saad B. Omer (@SaadOmer3) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaadOmer3/status/1334528902459494410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pxGngP"&gt;“That’s four months,” Rankin says. “We took more of a subjective approach to ask about the amount of time — do you feel like it’s going to be forever? Or do you feel like you’re going to get your results before you know it?” People who were more worried about their bar exam results felt like time was passing more slowly, she found. The two spiral together: people who are worried feel like time is moving more slowly, and the more slowly time seems to be passing, the worse they say they’re coping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgYyBG"&gt;For that reason, Rankin says people who had more pandemic-related distress might have experienced more time distortion this year. People working on the front lines of the pandemic in hospitals, or who lost friends or family to COVID-19, might have a more unstable sense of time than people who were able to work from home and didn’t lose loved ones. “Time perception is affected by stress, and stress affects time perception,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtmwDj"&gt;Stress has also robbed us of another anchor that grounds us in time: a conception of the future. When jobs are unstable, school schedules are up in the air, and rules regularly shift, it’s hard to envision what might happen next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fkJmWn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A sense of the future is central to our ability to get up in the morning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dpLvCY"&gt;A sense of the future is central to our ability to get up in the morning and confidently go about the day, Holman says. “What we’re doing today, what we’re doing tonight, what we’re doing tomorrow, we have a sense of that — and those things motivate us and keep us going,” she says. “When you mess with a person’s sense of time, and just chop off a future, you’ve disrupted the whole balance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHkIoc"&gt;When people experience this ‘temporal disintegration’ in response to a traumatic event, they run the risk of getting mentally stuck on that point in time. “Time isn’t moving forward for them in the same way it normally does,” she says. “That ends up making them more distressed, because they stay focused on this negative event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abWtPX"&gt;This year is unlike any other traumatic event, she says — it’s a chronic stressor, extended over a long period of time, and punctuated by moments of intensity. “People may be going through their lockdown, or whatever they’re going through, and then someone in their family gets sick, or gets hospitalized, or dies. And that’s an acute stress,” she says. That may distort time in unique ways, and Holman is conducting research to try to understand how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4pTSDG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2020 really went like :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;January, February, March, December .&lt;/p&gt;— shʌvo (@shavoawesome) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shavoawesome/status/1333763116631429120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zWRXz"&gt;The constant, unrelenting stress meant that for some people, the disintegrated state of time could have lingered through the year. “I would expect that the distorted perceptions of time would likely persist as the chronic stressors persist, if they’re really serious, like the pandemic,” she says. It could be similar to the way people living with chronic depression tend to feel changes in time perception for as long as they’re having symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gDe4I"&gt;It’s December now, and I’m still feeling unmoored. That won’t last forever — eventually, things should recalibrate, Holman says. Once a stressor ends, people usually regain their footing in time. After a car crash, time can recalibrate within a few hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="a3iul3"&gt;That will carry into the future but won’t retroactively modify the memories we have from the year. Mine are few and far between — March is vivid, but the rest feels blurry and punctuated by moments that feel like they might have happened in another lifetime. The strange way time passed this year could give our recollections of it a disorienting glare, as well. “I would guess that for this year, it’ll be hard to remember the details,” Holman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDvkqF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MENsuN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020’s most popular games were my most reliable social spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Epyx_dtdVbY3zT5gnlMul_RENGQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68515285/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_PartyPlay_SCRN_05_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTKhhJ"&gt;This year, video games provided escapism for a lot of people. But for many, myself included, the games I remember most fondly in 2020 were the ones that became social spaces. The pandemic didn’t make me want to escape; it made me miss my friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDjim2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; came out amid the shutdowns, and it quickly became my virtual island paradise, even when I wasn’t playing. I couldn’t log in to Facebook or Twitter without seeing almost everyone on my feeds talking about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing. &lt;/em&gt;People were sharing memes, asking for Dodo codes to visit their friends’ islands, and begging for specific fruit that they wanted to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfZzxd"&gt;Some turned to &lt;a href="https://nookazon.com/"&gt;Nookazon&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party trading platform, to buy outfits they had a hard time finding. The latest &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; title ushered in a new community of people that were taking the game so seriously that someone without context could easily think all these people purchased some island real estate after reading a travel blog. It was the early months of 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185608/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-coronavirus-escape-interview"&gt;we were stuck inside&lt;/a&gt;. As it got warmer, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; provided us with the tropical getaway we could actually visit. I even know people who purchased a Switch just so they could play this game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4s3bg1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even at work, my colleagues were also playing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rWBFR"&gt;One of my best friends lives in another state, but that distance has never stopped her from being the person I go to when I need to vent about life. So I begged her to buy a Switch so we could play &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. She came to the game a few months after I did, and since I was so far ahead, we would FaceTime, and I would guide her through the early tasks of the game, occasionally dropping off extra resources at her island if she needed to build the museum or wanted to decorate her house. We would constantly “hang out” on each other’s islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ywHmN"&gt;Since I had just started working at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, I was constantly telling my friend my experiences of my new job and some of the weirdest news I saw that day. It felt like we were actually hanging out like old times, despite the fact we were states apart and unable to see each other because of the shutdowns and travel advisories.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="fall guys" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6x_r3DNpohvt1MesqX5oTKRoTEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171549/ss_b2b6b170330b8af1f50d0e90efad984adafeb281.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ofFuV2"&gt;Even at work, my colleagues were also playing. Our workplace is organized by Slack channels, so naturally, two were dedicated to &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. One was a social space centered on the game, sharing advice, pictures of bugs, and organizing happy hour visits to someone’s island. (&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news writer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters"&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/a&gt; once planned an extremely sophisticated scavenger hunt.) The other channel was all business, though: namely, colluding to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21213923/animal-crossing-new-horizons-turnip-prices-sell-exchange-profit"&gt;manipulate the game’s “stalk market”&lt;/a&gt; so we would all get rich shorting turnip prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wppoeO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For a minute, it seemed like everyone was talking about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6LzIi"&gt;One week, I had an incredibly high turnip price on my island. I shared the number in the Slack channel, and it blew up. I opened my gates to visitors during my lunch break and the demand of people far exceeded the time it took me to make and eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I left my Switch on idle, went back to work, and returned later to collect two million bells’ worth of tips for my generosity. It felt like my birthday in a way, which was in late April, and I, unfortunately, could not celebrate it with many people. So I soaked in all the love and praise and endless thanks for being kind enough to open my gates and suffering through the hellish nightmare that is Animal Crossing’s multiplayer loading screens as travelers came in and out of my island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8M3A7p"&gt;For a minute, it seemed like everyone was talking about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;: discussing favorite villagers, sharing tips on capturing bugs and fish. I was exchanging Dodo codes with people I went to high school with but would not have called friends — until they arrived on my island. We could all share the common ground of playing a low-stakes adventure. If the game is a satisfying loop, reconnecting with old friends and making new ones is the real reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilPjpG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; was a game that came out during the dog days of summer, and word got out on how addicting its gameplay was thanks to streaming platforms like Twitch, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452358/fall-guys-among-us-twitch-facebook-gaming"&gt;the way games go viral these days&lt;/a&gt;. But most importantly for me, I have two younger cousins I hang out with frequently and they were looking for some new games to play since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was removed on iPad&lt;/a&gt;. So together, we let our asses get kicked by &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36UZ33"&gt;It was fun sitting with them on the couch at my aunt and uncle’s house. We would take turns seeing how far we would get in each match before we were smacked hard, knocked off the platform into a never-ending sea of Pepto Bismol, and subsequently eliminated. I am not a huge fan of battle royale games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; is easily accessible for all ages and doesn’t have convoluted gameplay mechanics. Also, it’s hard to not constantly laugh at all the sounds these bean-shaped characters make as they waddle to the end of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4zbxaV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The popularity of ‘Among Us’ grew exponentially this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SeD24D"&gt;The most surprising game of 2020, and arguably one with a lot of staying power in the long term, is &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, a cartoony riff on &lt;em&gt;Werewolf&lt;/em&gt;, wherein an imposter or two attempts to murder all their friends. Like &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a game the internet won’t shut up about. While it was originally released in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ popularity grew exponentially this year&lt;/a&gt;. My friends from college also started playing the game this year, and a bunch of us ended up creating a Discord server dedicated to &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;. We have channels dedicated to memes or finding new matches. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="among us" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuhtSPDmBzztC_OvP31aU6EsD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171550/ss_eab32f16b59c005489c10f9063227ed7b54b31ec.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EmiJCJ"&gt;I think fondly of all the memories we have of hanging out in the college dorm rooms playing &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; or compromising our friendships with an intense game of &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt;. With college now over and most of us living pretty far away from each other, I missed the days we could huddle in the dorms and play the GameCube classics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q86Hkn"&gt;Now we’re doing the equivalent of that in &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, getting nostalgic over stories from college while debating who the imposter is. Over the last few months, I would often play this game after work, for hours on end, until I realized it was midnight. It’s in those moments that reality kicked in and I realized I was not a 21-year-old who would stay out with my friends partying until 4AM; I am a 25-year-old adult with responsibilities and a full-time job. My priorities have changed, but making time for my friends will never get old no matter the circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ytSXMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The common theme for all these games is the sense of normalcy they have provided in my life&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7bcYS"&gt;But the common theme here for all these games is the sense of normalcy they have provided in my life. While I enjoy happy hours with my colleagues and weekly family Zoom meetings, these activities grew tiresome for me. These things serve as a painful reminder of what life was like before the pandemic. I miss going to rooftop bars after work and unwinding from work mode; I miss going to my grandparents’ house on the weekends and having cookouts and big Sunday dinners. I love my family, and I love my colleagues, but I craved the more interactive and creative conversation that games offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHwkhP"&gt;I was playing games with friends and family before the pandemic began, and I play a lot of games solo, too. But &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;are good-ass games that continued to get better as I enjoyed them with familiar company. They allowed me to make up for the lost time that was part of my old life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhQ2rO"&gt;The point of going out to bars was never the drinking. It was a common social space, and in a year where those places disappeared, we found new ones in fake islands and spaceships, and whatever the setting of &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to be. Especially in 2020, it’s not about where you are but who you’re with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGEpSK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2EMUr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok to hide graphic videos behind warning screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPoEVGsGw-xLt8076G1KLJsXYSY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68515102/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGjR2O"&gt;TikTok has unveiled a newly updated set of community guidelines and tools, which include new warning screens on graphic videos, a new text-to-voice accessibility feature, and updated health resources. The update brings new vaccine information which will be added to TikTok’s coronavirus resource hub as well as resources to be shown if people search for certain terms, like those related to self-harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13cb8U"&gt;According to TikTok, the graphic content warning screens are meant to prevent the accidental viewing of content that some might find disturbing. The screen gives two options, letting users either view the clip or skip it entirely. More extreme content is removed from the service entirely, but the new warning labels cover clips that might be allowed for “documentary reasons,” scenes from horror movies, or violent scenes of animals hunting. This content is already not distributed via the service’s For You feed, TikTok says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ckdA9V_SvlM2WdJc3iWa9TCpj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171466/Tips_and_Support.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searching for certain terms will now link users to helpful resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MOkqzZ"&gt;Also announced today is a new text-to-voice accessibility feature which will read out text as it appears in a video. Its release follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612380/tiktok-photosensitive-epilepsy-warning-update-coming"&gt;epilepsy warnings&lt;/a&gt; that the service recently started adding to photosensitive videos. Meanwhile, users who search for terms like “selfharm” or “hatemyself” will be shown help resources, and links to organizations like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Textline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkqT5K"&gt;Vaccine information is also being added to TikTok’s coronavirus resource hub, which is accessible from the service’s Discover page, search results, and banners on videos related to the disease or vaccines generally. The hub will be updated to include commonly asked questions and answers about COVID-19 vaccines from public health experts like the Centers for Disease Control. TikTok says the resource hub has been viewed over 2 billion times in the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgnZPp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhuKhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon generates millions of pounds of plastic waste</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Fulfilment Center In Sosnowiec" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LafGDAMDVdb4p6L4779sSBckNWw=/1x0:4738x3158/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514968/1143844285.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon fulfilment center in Sosnowiec, Poland on 13 May, 2019.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7d6hXP"&gt;Amazon’s plastic pollution is under scrutiny today with the publication of a new &lt;a href="https://plastics.oceana.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amazons-Plastic-Problem-Revealed-December-15-2020-Oceana.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the nonprofit ocean advocacy organization Oceana. That report estimates that Amazon was responsible for 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste last year. Amazon says that figure is overblown — by over 350 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQ6Iw0"&gt;Amazon claims that it uses about a quarter of Oceana’s estimate, according to an email from the company to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If that’s the case, then Amazon still used more than 116 million pounds of plastic packaging in 2019. Amazon did not share what its total plastic footprint was either through a spokesperson or in its most recent sustainability report published last &lt;a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/pdfBuilderDownload?name=sustainability-all-in-september-2020"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1pcw9u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L1DR7u"&gt;Oceana still stands by the figures in its report, despite Amazon’s objections. “[Amazon] continues to, in response to questions about plastic use, offer anecdotes about packaging weight rather than transparency,” a spokesperson for the organization said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Even the low number claimed by the company for its plastic packaging footprint would still be an enormous amount of plastic waste — enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows and to cause very large problems for the oceans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zo99XR"&gt;The characteristic that makes plastic a sought-after packaging material for companies like Amazon happens to also make it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542109/plastic-waste-united-states-ocean-pollution-study"&gt;a big problem for the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; — it’s easy to move because it’s so light-weight. That makes it a great material for Amazon’s air pillows. It also means that it only takes a ride down a storm drain or a strong gust of wind to push plastic debris into the sea. Once the plastic is at sea, it adds to floating mountains of garbage and frequently winds up in animals’ bellies. In 2019, a whale off the shores of the Philippines was found with &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/03/whale-dies-88-pounds-plastic-philippines/"&gt;88 pounds of plastic&lt;/a&gt; in its stomach. And when humans eat fish that have ingested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; left over from our trash, that plastic can end up in our bellies, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFWvQU"&gt;Oceana is concerned that as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;more people shop online&lt;/a&gt;, a greater share of leftover packaging will end up in the ocean. Since Amazon hasn’t publicly released numbers on its plastic pollution, Oceana tried to track it down itself. “What you don’t measure you cannot manage. So we had to estimate this,” says Anne Schroeer, a director of strategic initiatives at Oceana. “Obviously, it would be much better if Amazon would publish their plastic footprint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DAE4xR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What you don’t measure you cannot manage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPCyhW"&gt;Oceana used a roundabout way to try to figure out how much plastic waste Amazon creates — which is why there’s such a big discrepancy between its figures and how much plastic Amazon says it actually used. To reach its 465 million pound estimate, the nonprofit gathered data from packaging industry analysts on the amount of plastic packaging used around the world. They then assumed that Amazon’s share of that plastic waste matched its share of the e-commerce market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bgh7RE"&gt;Using that assumption, Oceana estimated that up to 22 million pounds of Amazon’s plastic packaging waste polluted freshwater and marine ecosystems across the world last year. It based &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; projection on a &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6510/1515"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year that estimated that 11 percent of global plastic waste wound up in aquatic ecosystems. That study, however, isn’t limited to packaging waste, which makes it difficult to use its data as a way to pinpoint how much plastic pollution Amazon sent to oceans, rivers, and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgOA7O"&gt;“We share Oceana’s ambition to protect and restore the world’s oceans, and we support the reduced use of plastics. However, Oceana has dramatically miscalculated Amazon’s use of plastic,” a spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2rq4Mh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We support the reduced use of plastics”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MMYVd"&gt;Amazon has taken measures to cut down on how much trash comes from its packages such as sending items in their original packaging rather than boxing them up with more plastic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20986298/cyber-monday-black-friday-amazon-effect-recycling-cardboard-shopping"&gt;cardboard&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that it’s cut more than 900,000 tons of packaging material since 2015. It also developed a padded paper mailer in 2019 as a recyclable alternative to the plastic packaging the company uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRRGRP"&gt;Although bags and envelopes made out of plastic film can technically be recycled, in reality, a lot of it is probably tossed away. In most cities, curbside recycling programs don’t accept plastic film. Most Amazon customers would need to bring it to a nearby drop-off location that does accept that type of plastic. Oceana surveyed 600 Amazon Prime customers in the US in May, of which less than two percent of shoppers said they made the trek to drop off their used plastic packaging. Historically, only nine percent of the entire world’s plastic waste has ever been recycled, according to a &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700782"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCPIZ6"&gt;Oceana believes Amazon can do more to slash its packaging waste, and sees the changes it’s made in India as a good example. This June, Amazon India announced that it &lt;a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.in/sustainability/amazon-india-successfully-eliminates-100-single-use-plastic-in-packaging-across-its-fulfilment-centers"&gt;eliminated single-use plastics&lt;/a&gt; in its packaging at its fulfillment centers. The move followed India’s goal of phasing out single use plastics by 2022. Amazon also offers “packaging-free” delivery in more than &lt;a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.in/operations/amazon-india-expands-packaging-free-shipping-to-more-than-100-cities"&gt;100 Indian cities&lt;/a&gt; — items are delivered in original packaging from the manufacturer and orders with multiple items are delivered in reusable totes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6MmXZ"&gt;Schroeer’s organization is pushing Amazon to bring reusable packaging to more places around the world. “[Amazon has] shown in India how fast they can really take action,” Schroeer says. “We are really confident that they can change quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ2rlV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal adds support for encrypted group video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nPqAgxdkhk7jDBINMbDhgtHEGE0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514888/group_calling_hero_compressed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group video calls are rolling out now.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pz2k9g"&gt;Encrypted messaging app Signal has added support for group video calls for up to five people, the &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Group calls can be started by tapping the video call button at the top of a supported group chat. Calls are “end-to-end encrypted — like everything else on Signal,” the company says. By default, participants are shown in a grid format, but you can swipe up for a view that focuses on individual speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNHhJm"&gt;With a five-person limit, Signal isn’t going to be replacing video conferencing services like Zoom any time soon, but the company says it’s working to increase the maximum number of call participants over time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xdu5Qefsi3OvwPq55cjFxnf-fB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171506/ezgif.com_gif_maker__7_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group calls default to a gallery view, but you can swipe up to focus on the person talking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jISbbY"&gt;Group video calls are available in the service’s iOS and Android apps, but for now they’re limited to new-style Signal group chats, and won’t appear in older, legacy chats. Signal launched its &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-groups/"&gt;new group chats back in October&lt;/a&gt;, adding support for @mentions, group admins, and more granular permissions. Older legacy chats will be upgraded to the new chat style in the coming weeks, Signal says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Driving the Mustang Mach-E, Ford’s first real electric car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1AKrO4-tW2lsONecCE-IRm96wLo=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514855/ahawkins_201212_4339_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Finally, an electric Ford of consequence &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yFtB1V"&gt;“Smooth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMp9RS"&gt;That was my wife’s first impression of the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E as we swept down a New Jersey rural road through surprisingly thick curtains of fog last Saturday. It was night, visibility was almost nil, and all I could think about was that this was not the ideal driving test for Ford’s first electric vehicle of consequence. I wanted to drive fast along some mountain road with hairpin turns — it’s an electric Mustang! — but the fog and the slick road conditions ensured that I proceeded with caution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nwbcJ"&gt;But I had to agree with her; it was smooth. From the whisper-quiet handling to the sinewy body style to the leather interior, the Mach-E radiated effortlessness. This is one of the most surprising — and satisfying — electric cars I’ve driven all year. After all, the Mach-E is the first new addition to the Mustang lineup ever. There’s no noisy V8 engine, no grumbling supercharger, no belching muffler, no non-existent backseat. Rather, it’s a zero-emissions electric crossover SUV that can easily fit two carseats in the backseats and a load of groceries in the trunk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ieTsRv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mustang fans are likely to be perplexed, but I think I can safely say that Ford has an unqualified hit on its hands&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ytu7mh"&gt;Mustang fans are likely to be perplexed, but I think I can safely say that Ford has an unqualified hit on its hands. And Ford definitely needed to knock this one out of the park. Its next EV, the electric Ford F-150, is also sure to be popular. But Ford needed to show everyone that it could make a powerful electric vehicle that was a blast to drive — and it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lTsYI"&gt;This isn’t just the opinion of a suburban dad who used the Mach-E to run errands and cart his kids around for three days. Everywhere I went, I was swarmed by curious on-lookers. It felt like hanging out with an automotive celebrity, based on the number of questions and requests for photos I got. People were drawn to this car. They had to know more. “An electric Mustang? An &lt;em&gt;electric&lt;/em&gt; Mustang?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SiSuS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, an electric Mustang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw3mWK"&gt;There is something inherently disorienting about the Mach-E. The Ford Mustang is one of the most iconic cars in American history. It’s one of the original muscle cars, synonymous with drag strips and Steve McQueen’s epic car chase in 1968’s &lt;em&gt;Bullitt&lt;/em&gt;. Somehow, I can’t quite picture McQueen’s irascible detective catching air on the hilly streets of San Francisco in this version of the Mustang, though I do think Lieutenant Bullitt would appreciate the all-wheel-drive and 333 horsepower that this First Edition Mach-E was packing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYKVH8cQuNYqOg6PpJCa86jCW18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170050/ahawkins_201212_4339_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z0_pCxwn98NAJfd0Lgf17GrPHuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170049/ahawkins_201212_4339_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m3KsUG"&gt;This trim level is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/11/17/20967565/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-specs-price-la-auto-show-2019"&gt;limited-production initial run&lt;/a&gt;, aptly named because it is the first version of the Mach-E to reach customers before the rest of the lineup reaches dealerships. It comes with special “First Edition” labels, brushed aluminum pedals, red brake calipers, and a bright blue paint job that Ford won’t offer on most other versions of the Mustang Mach-E. (Mine came in “carbonized gray metallic.”) For a suggested price of $59,900, you get an estimated 270 miles of range and a 0-to-60 mph time in the mid-five-second range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejq1af"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it drive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atbZeB"&gt;Let’s start with the good stuff: the Mach-E is an absolute dream to drive. The handling was balanced and controlled. The acceleration was impressive without feeling showy or dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbGdxz"&gt;There are three driving modes named Whisper, Engage, and Unbridled. Each offers specific changes to the driving experience such as steering tweaks, varied pedal feel, gauge-cluster graphics, and specifically tuned sound. When I first picked up the car, it was already in Unbridled mode, which is described as the most aggressive driving style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voCHCn"&gt;I really enjoyed the sportiness of this driving mode, but my wife said it made her feel nauseous, so I toggled between Engage and Whisper for most of my time with the car. Engage is said to be the mode that feels most like a Mustang, with tight steering and punchy acceleration. Like Goldilocks, I found it to be just right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfL0gztbBL3GvuBu4lMieri5440=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19385955/sokane_191117_3793_6362.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6M8mj1"&gt;Ford says the Mach-E will eventually have Level 2 autonomy, meaning a partially autonomous driver assist system analogous to Tesla’s Autopilot. The top trim levels have all the hardware to support hands-free highway driving at launch, but the feature will not be available yet; it’s supposedly coming in one of the first major over-the-air updates for the automaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lXBIb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford was reluctant to release a completely silent Mustang into the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DUIukm"&gt;The version I drove had all the basic advanced driver assist functions, including blindspot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and automatic emergency braking. They worked fine, nothing revelatory. The lane-keep assist was a little ping-pongy, but not excessively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5k3isV"&gt;While EVs are not necessarily known for their driving sounds, Ford was reluctant to release a completely silent Mustang into the world. The automaker created 30 unique sound profiles for the Mustang Mach-E, using &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and Batman’s Tumbler as a benchmark. When the EV is started, you get something akin to the ominous theme song from &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, or a low-key bass slap. Will this satisfy Mustang fans who crave the angry snort of a combustion engine? Doubtful, but I found it to be pleasant and easy to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJjOK5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWCnTE"&gt;The Mach-E is undeniably a Mustang, from the tri-bar tail lights, to the long hood and short nose combo, to the similarities in the bodywork. But in case you forget, Ford has slapped its galloping pony logo on the grille, the steering wheel, the wheel center caps, and the rear hatch. Ford’s Blue Oval logo is there too, at the center of the windshield on top of the vehicle’s vision system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkIrZe"&gt;As a five-passenger crossover SUV, it felt appropriately sized, neither too large nor small, slotting in between the Ford Escape and Edge in length, but with a longer wheelbase than both. It’s lower than a typical crossover — three inches lower than the Escape and five inches lower than the Edge — which made it easier for my kids to get into their carseats by themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMAXsk"&gt;Thanks to a narrow A-pillar and a stubby front end, I felt like I could see everything I was supposed to from the driver’s seat. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522959/cadillac-escalade-2021-first-drive-safety-oversized"&gt;So many SUVs on the market today&lt;/a&gt; have gargantuan front-ends, creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;dangerous front blind spots&lt;/a&gt; for drivers that could be fatal to people outside the vehicle, especially small children. Compact SUVs don’t typically have this problem, but it felt like Ford made the necessary design choices to ensure maximum visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__HYweP1o8v6hu9rspGbDQlrbAg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19385936/sokane_191117_3793_6122.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OmpGZo"&gt;The front end is certainly more aggressive than the Tesla Model Y’s. The multi-module LED headlights, which come with sequential turn signals that flash, are distinctive and expressive. And the hatchback rear-end is the Mach-E’s most crossover trait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QOrGm"&gt;The door handles are...well, missing. Not even a fold out or flip out handle. Instead there’s an itty-bitty fixed finger handle on the backside of the driver and passenger side doors. Above that there’s an electronic button that when pressed pops open the door. The rear doors also have a button, but no handle. It’s a very weird, idiosyncratic design choice, but I can’t begrudge Ford for doing it that way. The automaker says it designed these buttons-as-door-handles with children in mind, and I can see why; they were a big hit with my kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AY9cBI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I was expecting to really dislike the faux grille, with its Yosemite Sam-looking handlebar mustache&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GHuL2O"&gt;Let’s talk about the grille for a quick second. I was expecting to really dislike the faux grille, with its Yosemite Sam-looking handlebar mustache. But I didn’t mind it so much. There was so much about this car that was just thoroughly enjoyable that the grille became an afterthought. Also, I didn’t realize that there was an actual functional grille below the fake one that sucks in air when you run the AC, or when you’re using a DC fast charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaM9x8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnUFpF"&gt;Speaking of charging, I can’t recommend using a DC fast charger enough when charging the Mach-E. I tried using the charger that came with the vehicle, plugged into a normal 120-volt outlet in my garage, but I shouldn’t have bothered. Ford says you can only add 3 miles for every hour of charging through this method; an overnight charge barely moved the needle. But using a fast-charger that was in the automaker’s FordPass Charging Network, I was able to get from 40 percent to 80 percent in less than 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HugW71IjJalOwZKryVb5BGXDtAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171054/DSC_0156.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TWXtAi"&gt;(Full disclosure: I charged the vehicle when I was out by myself, sans wife and kids, and I can’t speak to anyone else’s patience with charging times but my own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHwRl2"&gt;A 240-volt charger would get me 22 miles for every hour of charging. Ford has plans to sell a faster home charger through a partnership with Amazon Home Services to help with installation — though it has yet to release pricing and availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OBTwQ"&gt;Ford claims that its FordPass Charging Network is the largest public network in the country, featuring 35,000 plugs at 12,500 charging stations in the US and parts of Canada, some of which are DC fast chargers that can charge the Mach-E to 80 percent in about 38 minutes. But Ford didn’t build its own network like Tesla; rather it leverages third-party EV chargers.  The company is also offering two years of complimentary charging for all new Mach-E owners, which is a nice incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlH8KZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The interior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl9vxA"&gt;Inside, the seats are black leather with red stitching, a nice compliment to the grey paint job and the red caliper brakes. I found the driver seat to be very comfortable, and the headroom to be expansive. The panoramic sunroof was similar to what’s found in most Teslas these days, and was a joy to sit under. The soft fabric on the dash was a nice touch, and the air vents are real air vents, with open and close knobs, so this might be the car for you if you find Tesla’s digital air vents off-putting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D3Nogv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The screen is really enormous, floating above the dashboard like the ether&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11nAy3"&gt;What about that screen, though? Of course I’m talking about the massive 15.5-inch touchscreen that sits in the center of the dash. Like most other EVs on the market, the Mach-E is lacking in physical buttons, save for one at the bottom of the screen that serves as volume control. There’s another dial in the center console that works as the gear shifter — but other than that, everything is controlled through the touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BwTW2"&gt;The screen is really enormous, floating above the dashboard like the ether. The vertical tablet reminded me more of the Tesla Model S than the Model 3, or perhaps even more like those tablets you’d find embedded in a high-tech refrigerator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZ-d0qHDbfzyqtjSeCm45gwNJrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171051/DSC_0146.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WrZXz4"&gt;I found the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971077/mustang-mach-e-ford-electric-sync-4-reveal-la-auto-show-2019"&gt;Sync 4 software&lt;/a&gt; to be one of the biggest drawbacks to the Mach-E. The layout was fine, but the user experience was lacking. Navigation was essentially worthless; after inputting a destination, the map offered no turn-by-turn directions and seemed to be lacking many street names. After a few non-starter attempts, I simply defaulted to CarPlay for most of my navigation and infotainment needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0rOs4"&gt;The Mach-E supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto wirelessly. The smartphone integration only uses the top half of the screen, though the latest version of CarPlay supports portrait orientation, so Apple could have used the whole screen if it wanted. That said, the image is large enough, about nine to 10 inches across, so you’re not really losing out with just half the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i83451"&gt;Tapping through the settings gets you to the camera feature, where you can see the 360-degree image of the car from the top down, as well the view from the rear-mounted camera. Ford uses a good amount of the screen to show you these images, which really helps when reversing or navigating tight spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkv0Ma"&gt;There are still a bunch of buttons on the steering wheel, as well as buttons on the turning and wiper stalks. Ford has found a nice balance between Tesla-style minimalism and the need to have some tactile controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XarhQW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The verdict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhePND"&gt;This may sound like missing the forest for the trees, but the Mach-E has got me really excited for what comes next. This is a fantastic electric car, superbly designed and really fun to drive. But that said, I’d love to see Ford take all the basic elements and stick it into the body of an Escape — something that retails for less than $25,000 and would instantly be affordable to a bigger swath of customers. Give me a cheap, bland midsized Ford electric SUV to bang around town with my grubby kids, dammit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRRbwA"&gt;The Mach-E is a gorgeous car with a less than attractive price tag. The base model is the $43,895 Select version. Even with the $7,500 federal tax credit, that version will just barely crack the average sale price for a new car in the US. I get it; it’s an electric Mustang. That’s very cool, and cool costs extra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MUXQqt"&gt;I get why Ford chose the Mustang nameplate for its first EV. It wanted our attention. And now that has it, it’s time for Ford to show us what it can really do with this technology. &lt;/p&gt;
