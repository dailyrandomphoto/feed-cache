    <title>The excellent Beats Fit Pro earbuds are coming to many more countries on January 28th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIDPIb"&gt;Beats’ best earbuds yet, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, were only available in the United States immediately upon their release a few months ago. Apple then launched the earbuds in China, but now they’re set to become much more widely available on January 28th. That’s when the Beats Fit Pro will launch across Canada, Europe, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV04z1"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1480947737118101506"&gt;a tweet from the Apple-owned brand&lt;/a&gt;, preorders for the “worldwide” release will begin on January 24th before the buds hit shelves on the 28th. The Beats Fit Pro include flexible wingtips that help them (comfortably) stay anchored in your ears without coming loose — even during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaoI5x"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-canada-europe-japan-release-date-161335850.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Europe the Beats Fit Pro will be priced at £200 / €230; in Canada they’ll cost $250 CAD; and in Japan you’ll be able to get them for 24,800 yen. As in the US, the Fit Pro earbuds will be offered in black, white, gray, and purple. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptNyqVVjvt3IM3On3kkY-q2tLvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973260/DSCF6027_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds are basically a sportier version of the AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYFwzG"&gt;They feature the same active noise cancellation system as the AirPods Pro, IPX4 water resistance, and also support head tracking when listening to spatial audio. Battery life is rated at up to six hours on a charge, with the case good for another 21 hours. They don’t check off all the bells and whistles: there’s no wireless charging, for example, and AirPods still perform better on voice calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tG3gc5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Beats Fit Pro review: sporty AirPods Pros with better sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gLqzYG"&gt;But they maintain most of Apple’s ecosystem tricks while delivering arguably better, more powerful sound in a fit that offers superior stability. They’re our top pick for workout earbuds, but I find myself using them just as regularly for everyday listening.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best gaming laptop in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best gaming laptop is the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="23pZwg"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQQiQ0"&gt;This year’s model comes with an FHD 360Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop. It also has a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color without being too intense for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion 5 Pro is a powerful device with a massive 16:10 display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5 Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;A gaming laptop with a 16:10 screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc2Q91"&gt;The Legion 5 Pro is the best gaming laptop Lenovo has ever made. For well under $2,000, you get exceptional performance from AMD’s Ryzen 5000 processors in an attractive 16-inch chassis. It delivered respectable results on every game we tried, even at its native 2560 x 1600 resolution. And with the 165Hz display, you’ll be able to fully take advantage of the Legion 5 Pro’s power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QoThO"&gt;Performance aside, the highlight of the Legion 5 Pro is its 16:10 screen. A screen this tall is hard to find on the gaming laptop market these days, and it allows you more room for multitasking if you want to use the Legion 5 Pro as a daily driver. The keyboard is also a delight to use, with 1.5mm of travel and four-zone programmable backlighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoBjtO"&gt;The Legion’s main downside is its battery life. We only got about four and a half hours of continuous use in our testing. While that’s not the worst we’ve ever gotten from a gaming laptop, it’s nowhere near what you’ll see from the G15. However, it does charge very, very fast with the included 300W power brick. Overall, though the G15 will be a better option for folks who often work on the go, the Legion is still a solid choice—and we have to give Lenovo props for the 16:10 screen.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BzyEj8"&gt;The best AMD gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is a great gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="OCz9wT"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OanWnj"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful 14-inch device that can keep up with the best 15-inch gaming laptops on the market, the only place you’ll find that is the Razer Blade 14. This slim and portable device includes Nvdia’s RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, Nvidia’s top-of-the-line mobile GPUs, as well as a powerful eight-core AMD chip. It’s a gorgeous device, with a QHD 165Hz display option and a classy RGB keyboard. There’s even a reasonable port selection, including HDMI 2.1 as well as two USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="J74U3a"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765258/alienware-x17-review-4k-17-inch-gaming-laptop"&gt;Alienware X17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lzKwju"&gt;A gaming laptop with a 4K screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m6FWbU"&gt;There’s finally a laptop that can deliver an enjoyable gaming experience in 4K — as long as you’re prepared to fork over some real cash. The Alienware X17 (currently starting at $2,199) can run all kinds of modern titles at playable frame rates at its native 3840 x 2160 resolution. It could even stay close to 60fps with ray tracing on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULSQ9m"&gt;The X17’s power isn’t its only standout quality. Dell has also managed to cram that power into an impressively thin and sleek chassis. It’s just 0.84 inches thick, with an RGB keyboard that isn’t too obnoxious and a touchpad that lights up when you press it. And it’s quite cool and quiet, even under heavy gaming loads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpAXv8"&gt;On the other hand, the X17 would not be a good choice to double as a daily driver (though it did do well in our Premiere Pro testing). The webcam is mediocre, and the touchpad is a bit small, especially for a 17-inch notebook. Battery life only averaged around four hours in our testing. And while the chassis is compact, it’s still not light, weighing in at over six pounds. But if you’re looking for a 4K laptop that is, first and foremost, great at running games, this device should top your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="n9BvYP"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22723299/razer-blade-15-advanced-late-2021-review-specs-features-design"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and comes with a 240Hz QHD display, but at just 4.39 pounds and 0.62 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A ransomware attack took a New Mexico jail offline, leaving inmates in lockdown </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EThHjots8e6FtCMqqtGFthbvCSU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375264/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YRrncq"&gt;A ransomware attack last week has left an Albuquerque area jail without access to its camera feeds and rendered automatic door mechanisms unusable. Inmates have been confined to their cells as a result, while technicians struggled to bring systems back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ic2jk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2459954/cyber-attack-leads-to-jail-lockdown-settlement-violations.html"&gt;As first reported by the Albuquerque Journal&lt;/a&gt;, visitor access to the Metropolitan Detention Center was completely suspended as the jail was put into lockdown. All internet services at the jail were also knocked offline, leaving staff unable to look up inmate records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tgT7cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All county internet services at the jail were also knocked offline, leaving staff unable to look up inmate records&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9jt6h"&gt;Based on the lack of camera coverage, all inmates within the facility were placed on lockdown from the morning of January 5th. Further, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21176926-bernalillo-county-notice-of-emergency"&gt;emergency notice&lt;/a&gt; filed by the county, the incident tracking database containing all reports of fighting, use of force, and allegations of sexual assault was not available and is believed to be corrupted by the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvwPiC"&gt;“In the early morning of January 5, 2022, the automatic door mechanisms at MDC were unusable, meaning that staff had to use keys to manually open facility doors,” wrote Taylor Rahn, an attorney for the county, in a court notice related to the lockdown. “One of the most concerning impacts of the cyber attack is that MDC is unable to access facility cameras. As of the evening of January 5th, there was no access to cameras within the facility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wDke9"&gt;The detention center was just one point of impact in a &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/albuquerque-impacted-by-ransomware-attack-on-bernalillo-county-government/"&gt;larger ransomware attack that struck Bernalillo County&lt;/a&gt;, the most populous county in New Mexico, on January 5th. County employees were left unable to access any local government databases, and all public offices were temporarily closed. A press release dated January 10th noted that county office headquarters were still &lt;a href="https://www.bernco.gov/blog/2022/01/10/alvarado-square-open-on-lobby-level-only/"&gt;only partially re-opened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uT7CW"&gt;The unexpected lockdown put the jail in potential violation of the terms of a settlement in a lawsuit over conditions of confinement, forcing Bernalillo County to file an emergency notice in federal court. &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-nmd-6_95-cv-00024/pdf/USCOURTS-nmd-6_95-cv-00024-15.pdf"&gt;A settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; from a 1995 lawsuit required county jails to adopt new protocols in response to broader complaints about overcrowding and other conditions, including a guarantee that inmates are given regular access to telephones and other communications devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPpdpb"&gt;But the total failure of the jail’s internal computer network could force the facility to violate that agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6okw6J"&gt;“[L]imited out of cell time may have an impact on inmates’ ability to access telephones and tablets,” the emergency filing says. “Further, depending on the length of the impact of the attack, County Defendant may be unable to gather data required by the Settlement Agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtrUfy"&gt;Contacted by telephone, Rahn’s office said she was not immediately available for comment. Email and voicemail messages sent to Bernalillo County officials had not been answered at time of press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzsabl"&gt;Ransomware is increasingly seen as one of the top threats facing both private businesses and government institutions across the US. Last year the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"&gt;created the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force&lt;/a&gt; to coordinate information sharing between DOJ divisions and with outside agencies, signaling a new approach to tackling the problem. Nonetheless, reports from the US Treasury estimate that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;ransomware payouts for 2021&lt;/a&gt; will still top all previous records.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will redo Bessemer union election on February 4th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBbQjdt-8zaNK8TiXiWjfemG9C0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375180/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NLRB said Amazon broke labor laws in the original election.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ob1ga"&gt;The second union election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama will begin on February 4th, according to a notice posted Tuesday by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which you can read below. The election is a redo of the one that was carried out in 2021, the results of which were declared invalid by the regulatory agency after reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;Amazon had broken labor laws&lt;/a&gt; during the union drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzk62X"&gt;The election will be carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;almost a year after&lt;/a&gt; workers originally voted on whether to unionize Amazon’s BHM1 facility. The union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;lost that election nearly two-to-one&lt;/a&gt; but disputed the results, taking issue with a mailbox that employees feared Amazon had access to. The mailbox was installed by the USPS, at Amazon’s request, and at one point had a “privacy tent” put up around it, which the NLRB says employees believed was monitored with video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6lGAQk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The redo is taking place because regulators found Amazon interfered in the first election&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cdllp"&gt;The NLRB cites the mailbox in its notice of the second election, saying that the results of the first are being set aside after the regulator “found the Employer interfered with the employees’ exercise of a free and reasoned choice by creating the appearance of irregularity in the election.” It also accuses Amazon of “improperly polling employees’ support during mandatory meetings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E83WXP"&gt;The redo will be carried out through the mail and supervised by the NLRB. In response to the notice, the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (the organization behind the union drive in Bessemer) put out a statement saying that it’s “deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election.” The RWDSU says it “proposed to the NLRB a number of remedies that could have made the process fairer to workers, which were not taken up in the Notice of Election issued today,” and promises to “continue to hold [Amazon] accountable for [its] actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElU4Tz"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEzX5E"&gt;The NLRB says that it will start counting the ballots on March 28th, though ballots will have to reach its offices by March 25th to be counted. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851842/amazon-union-settlement-nlrb-email-electronic-post-rights"&gt;Due to a recent NLRB / Amazon settlement&lt;/a&gt;, organizers may have more opportunities this time around — the company has agreed to stop barring employees from being at their workplace more than 15 minutes before or after their shifts if they’re carrying out union activity and has promised to prominently post statements of workers’ rights in its facilities and employee apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peer-to-peer car-sharing service Turo files to go public </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDwR-3rfIsYyv502krEArJBzxuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70375154/akrales_180222_2325_0024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWkSHp"&gt;Turo, the peer-to-peer car-sharing service, has filed for its initial public offering, the latest transportation-related startup to sell its shares on a public stock exchange. The company proposes to sell $100 million of stock, but that figure could change as Turo gets closer to its public debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2jBdJ"&gt;Founded in 2010, the San Francisco-based company allows people to rent out their personal cars to other customers, much like Airbnb does for homes. In its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1514587/000119312522005696/d145731ds1.htm#toc145731_4"&gt;S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Turo claims it has 85,000 active hosts (meaning vehicle owners), 161,000 active vehicles, and 1.3 million active guests over the period of 12 months ending September 30th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N0fyXm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;opting for an old-fashioned IPO rather than a SPAC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0b4EAM"&gt;Unlike many transportation-related startups in recent years, the San Francisco-based company is opting for an old-fashioned IPO rather than merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. Turo also stands out because it’s not specifically tied to electric or autonomous vehicles, which have mostly fueled the recent SPAC and IPO craze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owru6h"&gt;Similar to other transportation startups, Turo has lost money every year its been in operation. As of September 30th, the company says it lost a cumulative $544 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMRF2S"&gt;The company plans on offering some of its shares exclusively to its users, both renters and owners, in a move similar to what Uber did when it offered specially priced shares to some of its drivers. Turo says it plans to offer 5 percent of its stock to “eligible hosts and guests on our platform and certain individuals identified by our officers and directors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfUAed"&gt;Turo claims it avoids the costs associated with owning large fleets, like its competitors in the rental car business like Avis, Hertz, and Enterprise, while also helping its hosts earn extra cash by renting out their unused vehicles. And Covid-19 has helped boost Turo’s business in relation to these legacy rental car services, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEFFUg"&gt;“Rental car companies reduced their fleet sizes in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been unable to quickly rebuild their fleets due to constraints in automobile manufacturing capacity,” Turo says. “In light of these conditions, more consumers turned to peer-to-peer car sharing for their vehicle needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVUWs9"&gt;Turo has run into regulatory hurdles in the past. The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/23/17040276/turo-sfo-lawsuit-car-sharing-enterprise"&gt;sued by the city of San Francisco in 2018&lt;/a&gt; for failure to pay the fees required to operate legally at the SFO airport. The company counter-sued the city, claiming it shouldn’t be subject to the same regulations as legacy rental car companies. A judge eventually ruled in the city’s favor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8kIfD"&gt;But there have also been some bright spots. Recently, New York State passed legislation legalizing peer-to-peer car-sharing, which is set to go into effect in the latter half of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop and Best Buy have Xbox Series X consoles for order right now (update: sold out at Best Buy)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYyML7jTlnEIS2cvCiHw3M6TywA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374466/vpavic_201103_4275_0196.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monolithic Xbox Series X console is still a bit tricky to get.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfYRnO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:58PM ET, January 11th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZecdP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:30PM ET, January 11th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; GameStop still has both bundles available, and now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgoIQEe59VB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has restocked Xbox Series X consoles. They are available for the standard $499.99 without a bundle. As usual for Best Buy, it is based on local availability at stores in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxxl53"&gt;Another week, another restock of Xbox Series X consoles at GameStop. Hopefully this is a trend that new console availability is opening up in 2022 to a point where soon anyone will be able to walk into a store and pick up their hardware of choice without any fuss. While we’re not quite there yet, the restocks are remaining fairly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJl8WL"&gt;GameStop has two Xbox Series X console bundles today, offered on its website for shipping to US addresses — as opposed to some of the recent in-store restocks we have seen. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-far-cry-6-nba-2k22-accessories-and-system-bundle-with-a-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745R.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The first bundle&lt;/a&gt; includes the Xbox Series X console, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt;, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a $50 GameStop gift card for a total of $749.95. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-elite-controller-game-pass-ultimate-and-system-bundle-with-a-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745S.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The second bundle&lt;/a&gt; has the Xbox Series X console paired with the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a $50 GameStop gift card for a total of $774.97.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk2OQM"&gt;This restock is not limited to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock010321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop Pro subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, but be sure to create a basic account or sign in to your existing account on GameStop’s site to streamline the process with your purchase info filled out, and always keep in mind that patience and persistence is key. You may get an error or a sold out notification when adding to your cart, but keep refreshing the listing and trying as long as that Add to Cart button is still there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook contractors threaten to stop work over missing paychecks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RvcMAJLVKldQNeKK0lAIVfHsuxA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374836/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0d8Nd"&gt;Facebook moderators at an Accenture site in Austin are facing a payroll disaster that has left many without their holiday paychecks. Workers at the site handle moderation, customer service, and other tasks for Facebook and WhatsApp — and a work stoppage has already been threatened if the situation is not resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wObVO"&gt;The problems began as early as January 4th, when some workers noticed errors in the system that tracks paid time off (PTO), a clerical confusion that was attributed to a recent change in payroll providers at the site. Things got more serious when the January 6th round of paychecks failed to arrive. Internal pay stub systems showed many paychecks as zeroed out, and workers were left with no idea of when they might get their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LkvxNg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Some employees have had to take out payday loans just so they could have enough money to buy food for their children.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RwkPaD"&gt;In an open letter to the CEOs of Facebook and Accenture, posted on an internal message board, a group of workers pledged to halt work at the site until the paychecks were issued in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgDFI1"&gt;“If these issues are not resolved immediately a work stoppage will be enacted,” the letter promised. “The work stoppage will begin on January 7th, 2022 if nothing is resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fqLpF"&gt;Several lump-sum payments were issued to affected workers shortly after the letter posted, and Accenture says the company has not seen any indication of coordinated work stoppage at the site in the days since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZmUG7"&gt;In a call with employees Saturday, a managing director at the Accenture site said he was unsure when the issue would be resolved, but the company would cover any late fees or overdraft charges incurred as a result of the delay. “You will be paid the amounts that you are due,” he said on the call, “and we will get that to you as quickly as we possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7kXWO"&gt;Some workers have received lump-sum payments from the company, meant to tide them over until the full amount can be properly calculated. But employees at the site say not everyone has received those payments, and many are in desperate financial straits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwGzaB"&gt;As of Monday night, one moderator at the Austin site said more than 50 people on his team still had not been paid. “I know many who are behind on bills, utilities, food, and rent,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When you only get paid $16 an hour in a town like Austin, missing a check is like missing a leg.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKNYok"&gt;The issue is particularly severe because of overtime pay and expenses incurred over the holidays, which have been lost in the shuffle between providers. “Some employees have had to take out payday loans just so they could have enough money to buy food for their children,” another employee told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPpAtt"&gt;Reached for comment, Accenture representative Stacey Jones emphasized that the company was working to resolve the problem. “We recently switched payroll providers and experienced some unanticipated challenges during our first payroll run with the new provider,” Jones told The Verge. “Our number one priority since last week has been getting our people who have experienced issues paid – and, we continue encouraging our people who need assistance to reach out to their supervisor or HR, so we can help them resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="przPZD"&gt;Meta (parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp) often subcontracts moderation and other personnel services to firms like Accenture, although the arrangement has been led to employee welfare in other instances. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video"&gt;A 2019 &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; into an Accenture site in Austin moderating YouTube videos found managers often forced employees to work through breaks and forego vacations when facing high demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zciObw"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed the disruption and emphasized Accenture’s efforts to address it. “Accenture has notified its employees of this issue,” said Meta representative Kadia Koroma, “and is working to resolve it as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oPvNZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Added new information from Accenture that the company has not seen evidence of work stoppage at the site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego delays Overwatch 2 set as company reevaluates relationship with Activision Blizzard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C631yWDY6zH4eA3xNjmlLOL3QNI=/365x0:1562x798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374832/Screen_Shot_2014-11-07_at_2.35.08_PM.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pR7jA"&gt;The name &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; has become synonymous with delay. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-overwatch-2-titan-76980-release-delayed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brick Fan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Lego review site, the extremely popular toymaker is delaying the release of an &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;-themed set as the company reviews its relationship with &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; publisher Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0kCm0"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Alice Carter, Lego’s senior manager of corporate brand communication, said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="v8tJzR"&gt;We are currently reviewing our partnership with Activision Blizzard given concerns about the progress being made to address continuing allegations regarding workplace culture, especially the treatment of female colleagues and creating a diverse and inclusive environment. While we complete the review we will pause the release of a LEGO Overwatch 2 product which was due to go on sale on February 1, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="77enOn"&gt;Activision Blizzard has been involved in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;extensive legal battle&lt;/a&gt; with several government agencies over allegations that its employees fostered a work environment rife with discrimination, abuse, and sexual harassment. As companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;privately&lt;/a&gt; express concerns about Activision Blizzard, Lego seems to be the first gaming-adjacent company to take direct action. Last year, advertisers including Kellogg’s and Coca-Cola &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22613315/overwatch-league-sponsor-kelloggs-pulls-ads-activision-blizzard-lawsuit"&gt;pulled their sponsorships&lt;/a&gt; from the Overwatch League — Activision Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; esports league — as the allegations first came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSfhDb"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-phil-spencer.html"&gt;an interview on &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; podcast &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, head of Xbox Phil Spencer said that Xbox has changed how they do things with Activision Blizzard but declined to go into detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJvfWi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDUzES"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvdRsE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YdZpo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ji846"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku rolls out all-new Live TV Zone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQNYp7oq7zQh-U127bDprhUDYXk=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374759/Live_TV_Zone_LHN.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c7Jyb6"&gt;Roku is making live TV even easier to find with its new Live TV Zone, a one-stop shop for all things live and linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCO67T"&gt;The Live TV Zone will be home to not only Roku’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;Live TV Channel Guide&lt;/a&gt;, which previously existed as a &lt;a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/details/1ac1f6c4b2a10445e55c6fca4f14d064/live-tv-on-the-roku-channel"&gt;standalone channel&lt;/a&gt;, but also third-party services like YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and Sling, among other apps. Users will also find their recently watched content in this tab, in addition to entertainment programming, sports, and local and national news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3XfVP"&gt;The Live TV Zone can be found under the Live TV tab from the left-hand navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2dmRr"&gt;Roku has been leaning heavily into its live TV features. The company last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22680133/roku-os-10-5-update"&gt;expanded voice command support&lt;/a&gt; for its live TV guide with the Roku OS 10.5 update. It also boosted its Live TV on The Roku Channel slate to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;more than 200 free channels&lt;/a&gt; last fall, effectively doubling the number of free-to-stream live channels available through the app in a little over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKtP4H"&gt;Citing a survey of 2,852 US adults &lt;a href="https://roku-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Roku-Streaming-Report_FINAL_Sept-2021.pdf"&gt;conducted last year&lt;/a&gt;, Roku said that nearly 61 percent of individuals without traditional pay TV still stream live news multiple times per week. The survey also found that pay-TV users only marginally reported greater satisfaction over sports streamers (80 percent to 75 percent satisfaction).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google can’t cloak documents showing an ‘antiunion campaign,’ NLRB judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9x85tLm0s4M53pNnByrMEmQ5Nc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374728/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Judge rules Google has to turn over 180 documents in an NLRB case | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J2zQlb"&gt;A judge appointed by the National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Google must turn over some 180 documents related to an internal campaign to fight union organizing efforts by employees. Dubbed Project Vivian, a Google attorney described the ongoing effort between 2018 and 2020 as a way to “engage employees more positively and convince them that unions suck,” according to one of the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJs7zB"&gt;The documents are part of a case the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;NLRB brought against Google&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020, which alleged the internet giant violated US labor law by spying on and firing employees who were organizing protests and trying to unionize. Former Google employee Laurence Berland, fired in 2019, was organizing against the company’s hiring of IRI Consultants, a firm known for its union-busting efforts. He said he was fired for looking at other employees’ calendars, breaking a Google policy which the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;NLRB found to be unlawful&lt;/a&gt;. And former Google employee Kathryn Spiers said she was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;fired after she created a pop-up for Google employees&lt;/a&gt; who visited the IRI Consultants website. The company claimed Spiers had violated security policies, but the NLRB found that her firing was also unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGGcwc"&gt;Google tried to claim attorney-client privilege to shield some of the documents that were subpoenaed in the case. But administrative law Judge Paul Bogas said Google’s “broad assertion, is, to put it charitably, an overreach,” according to a January 7th order &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; received following a Freedom of Information Act request. Bogas wrote in his ruling that IRI provided Google with “antiunion messaging and message amplification strategies” that were tailored to Google’s workforce, but IRI didn’t give Google legal advice that would be protected by attorney-client privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVtGEb"&gt;He added that Google had CC’d its legal counsel on documents that would not be considered privileged otherwise, in what appeared to be an effort to try to keep the documents private. He said Google “cannot spin the mere fact of a nascent organizing effort among employees into ‘litigation’ — like straw spun into gold — that entitles it to cloak in privilege every aspect of its antiunion campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olbnYa"&gt;Google spokesperson Jennifer Rodstrom said in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it considers the underlying case to be unrelated to unionization efforts, rather that “it’s about employees breaching clear security protocols to access confidential information and systems inappropriately.” She added that IRI was one of “dozens of outside consultants” Google works with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9Vyo2"&gt;If Google loses the case, it may be forced to pay back wages to Berland and Spiers and rehire them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROvIBm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gvgd37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McQ3T2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
