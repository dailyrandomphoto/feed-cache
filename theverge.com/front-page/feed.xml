    <title>Parler resurfaces on Sunday with an update message, but nothing else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="message—notice"&gt;Social media platform Parler was all but wiped off the internet last week, but on Sunday, showed some signs of life. A message from Parler CEO John Matze, first noted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donie/status/1350799549959458817"&gt;CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;- is now appearing at the &lt;a href="https://parler.com/"&gt;site’s URL&lt;/a&gt;, with an image showing a “technical difficulties” banner, and a message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zbp2x"&gt;“Now seems like the right time to remind you all — both lovers and haters — why we started this platform. We believe privacy is paramount and free speech essential, especially on social media,” the message reads, pledging to “welcome all of you back soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jomKZX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon dropped Parler from its hosting platform&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, saying in a letter it “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others.” &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/fast-thinking-how-the-capitol-riot-was-coordinated-online/"&gt;Parler was identified as a site &lt;/a&gt;where people who participated in the deadly January 6th assault on the Capitol had planned the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTrCM1"&gt;The site is now hosted by Epik, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/17/tech/parler-back-online/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_term=link&amp;amp;utm_content=2021-01-17T21%3A11%3A43&amp;amp;utm_source=twcnnbrk"&gt;as CNN notes&lt;/a&gt;, a hosting company that also supports far-right sites such as Gab and 8chan. Amazon’s suspension &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=parler+apple+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS779US780&amp;amp;oq=parler+apple+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5302j0j9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;followed Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google removing&lt;/a&gt; Parler’s app from their respective app stores. Matze said even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;Parler’s lawyers had cut ties.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uqoKu"&gt;Parler sued Amazon for cutting off its hosting, and in a response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon detailed some of the graphic, violent threats&lt;/a&gt; posted to the site that led to its removal, including posts that called for shooting police officers, killing Black and Jewish people, and assassinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Apa1"&gt;Parler launched in 2018, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;user numbers soared&lt;/a&gt; after Election Day in the US, as other social platforms tightened their moderation policies. Parler’s its less-strict moderation policies were a draw for many new users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kasKwB"&gt;Parler may have a tough road back to its former state, however, after researchers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;archived 99 percent of its posts&lt;/a&gt;, scraping videos and other data, some with GPS info. That archive was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231749/parler-interactive-map-video-gps-capitol-attack"&gt;used to create an interactive map&lt;/a&gt; of the attack on the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2swo52"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Cherry, Clarice, The United States vs. Billie Holiday, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6721JVRv2U_8oMQrdhVFJY4a5EI=/37x0:1252x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68682158/billie.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Andra Day stars in &lt;em&gt;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USi-ppCfxEA&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=Hulu" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axNlSi"&gt;I’m getting to the point where there’s so much to stream that I don’t know what to watch first, old shows I want to catch up on, or new shows/movies so I can keep up with all the references on Twitter. But! I am filled with hope for the coming weeks, as there are a slew of interesting-looking trailers for movies I have been waiting to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6E0eq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/USi-ppCfxEA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rMs8tY"&gt;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mXMImx"&gt;I sort of wish this movie had been named “Strange Fruit” after Holiday’s 1939 song that drew the ire of the FBI, but guessing a lot of people don’t know about this part of Holiday’s life. The great jazz singer who struggled with drug addiction saw the government wreck her career using an undercover sting operation, all over a controversial song. Really looking forward to watching this. Directed by Lee Daniels,&lt;em&gt; The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/em&gt; stars Andra Day, and premieres February 26th on Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWcEG8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfMHiNFOAis?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SBn3qR"&gt;Clarice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oP5wzG"&gt;Do we really need another show about a brilliant but troubled detective/agent who pursues terrible serial killers and solves graphic murders (usually of women)? Apparently CBS thinks we do, because it’s giving us &lt;em&gt;Clarice&lt;/em&gt;, a series about the rookie FBI agent from &lt;em&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/em&gt; that “takes a deep dive into her untold personal story.” See, she has to hunt serial killers &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; deal with the Washington DC bureaucracy! Most of this trailer shows people in authority being rude and/or dismissive to Clarice, which doesn’t really track; for example, the dick bureaucrat who tells her “we do &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt;, not at the full moon” obviously never saw the movie. If you can’t get enough of moody procedural crime drama, &lt;em&gt;Clarice&lt;/em&gt; hits CBS and CBS All Access February 11th. I’ll check out the pilot, but if they keep up with this spooky version of the song “Country Roads” we hear in the trailer, I might not last long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yY8O5M"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENv0B-jX3O4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vhcEZP"&gt;Breaking News in Yuba County&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5sZNFQ"&gt;Allison Janney stars in this dark comedy/mystery about a woman who says her husband has been kidnapped, and enjoys the sudden celebrity that goes along with the news. Of course, things are not quite as they seem! The all-star cast includes Mila Kunis, Awkwafina, Juliette Lewis, Jimmi Simpson, Wanda Sykes, Ellen Barkin, Samira Wiley, and Matthew Modine. &lt;em&gt;Breaking News in Yuba County&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Tate Taylor and lands in select theaters February 12th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="syHJmp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H5bH6O0bErk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fhvf5O"&gt;Cherry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Dhew9c"&gt;Glad that they fixed the &lt;a href="https://movieweb.com/cherry-poster-changed-tom-holland/"&gt;weird first poster&lt;/a&gt; for this movie, which stars Tom Holland as a veteran with PTSD who is addicted to opioids and robs banks to support his habit. It’s a little tough to reconcile Holland’s baby face with the movie’s dark plot, but there is much buzz about this flick, and about Holland’s performance. Based on a novel by Nico Walker, &lt;em&gt;Cherry&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Joe and Anthony Russo and hits theaters Feburary 26th and Apple TV Plus on March 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywhQki"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ivHf4ODMi4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L3iOto"&gt;Judas and The Black Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cbNRVp"&gt;This is the second trailer for this highly anticipated movie about the life and assassination of Black Panther party leader Fred Hampton, starring Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton, and LaKeith Stanfield as William O’Neal, the FBI informant who betrayed him. &lt;em&gt;Judas and The Black Messiah&lt;/em&gt; debuts on HBO Max and in theaters February 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CQj76"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub admits ‘significant mistakes were made’ in firing of Jewish employee </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Acquires GitHub : Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlBOC3TiNxqXaBT1eFs3TomIv6s=/38x0:4798x3173/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681542/967199944.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MhNOgs"&gt;GitHub is admitting that a Jewish employee was fired in error and is offering him his job back. The news comes after the company hired an independent law firm to investigate the termination, and found that “significant mistakes were made.” The company’s head of HR, Carrie Olesen, is also resigning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HU6E7Q"&gt;“Yesterday evening, the investigation reached the conclusion that significant mistakes were made that are not consistent with our internal practices or the judgement we expect from our leaders,” wrote GitHub CEO Nat Friedman in an internal message to employees on January 16th. He said the company would be issuing &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-01-17-update-on-an-employee-matter/"&gt;a public apology on its blog this weekend&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whnwDj"&gt;In the post, GitHub COO Erica Brescia said: “To the employee we wish to say publicly: we sincerely apologize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgq6NP"&gt;The controversial firing came just two days after the employee warned colleagues in Washington DC to stay safe from Nazis — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;news first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; He posted the message on January 6th, the day of the insurrection in Washington DC, as rioters associated with neo-Nazi organizations stormed the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zV8RXt"&gt;The warning sparked criticism from a colleague who took offense at the use of the word “Nazi” and prompted GitHub’s HR team to reprimand the Jewish employee. Two days later, he was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijiynM"&gt;In the wake of the termination, roughly 200 of GitHub’s 1,700 employees signed an open letter asking for clarity as to why the employee was let go. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232766/github-employees-protest-jewish-employee-firing-warn-nazi"&gt;Workers also started using the word “Nazi” repeatedly in Slack&lt;/a&gt;, to describe the rioters in DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig0JO1"&gt;“Others have already said so, but I just want to say it explicitly myself - I think that nazis were present at some protests on Jan 6, and that it’s very scary to see those ideas on display,” wrote one engineer in Slack. “100% Nazis were there, and 1000000000% Nazis are scary as fuck and do not belong anywhere. PARTICULARLY AT GitHub!” responded another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAOYQR"&gt;In his note to employees this weekend, Friedman stressed that employees (which the company calls “hubbers”) are allowed to talk about their fears regarding white supremacists. “Hubbers are free to express concerns about neo-Nazis, antisemitism, white supremacy or any other form of discrimination or harassment,” he wrote. “And of course, we expect Hubbers to be respectful, professional, and to follow GitHub policies on discrimination and harassment at all times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5LNUV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsYtr3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New lawsuit accuses Amazon of e-book price fixing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRHmBiLdB1w69YJz1w2nldtLGAo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681089/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HtU0h9"&gt;Amazon is facing a new lawsuit alleging that a deal between the company and five book publishers has created higher prices on e-books, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-a-longtime-e-book-discounter-is-accused-of-driving-up-the-price-of-e-books-11610748615?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4CMeo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/sites/default/files/case-downloads/amazon-ebooks-price-fixing/01.14.21-complaint.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by law firm Hagens Berman in a federal district court in New York, alleges that the publishers pay high commissions and other costs to Amazon, which in turn increases the retail price of e-books sold on the platform. Due to the deal between Amazon and the publishers— HarperCollins Publishers, Hachette Book Group, Penguin Random House, Simon &amp;amp; Schuster, and Macmillan &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; the Amazon price is the price the publishers charge other retailers as well, preventing other sellers from offering the e-books at lower prices, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XvWIs"&gt;The lawsuit claims the five publishers account for 80 percent of books sold in the US, and calls the arrangement  a “conspiracy to fix the retail price of e-books,”  which it argues is a violation of antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfQXHY"&gt;In another e-book lawsuit back in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/11/2941053/inside-the-dojs-ebook-price-fixing-case-against-apple-an-analysis"&gt;2012, the Justice Department accused Apple&lt;/a&gt; of conspiring with major book publishers in an attempt to compete with Amazon, by inflating e-book prices above the $9.99 price that Amazon preferred. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160620005051/en/Hagens-Berman-Payday-Millions-e-Book-Purchasers-400"&gt;Hagens Berman was lead counsel&lt;/a&gt; in the Apple case as well.  The publishers settled, but Apple went to court and lost, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/7/11172318/apple-supreme-court-price-fixing-appeal"&gt;eventually agreeing to a $450 million settlement&lt;/a&gt;, with $400 million issued as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/21/11991526/apple-ebook-price-fixing-refunds-begin-for-consumers"&gt;refunds to consumers&lt;/a&gt;. Apple denied any wrongdoing in regard to e-book pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7YnY2"&gt;Amazon declined to comment, as did Penguin Random House. The other publishers named in the lawsuit did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L17vqP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 17th 1:07PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds that Amazon and Penguin Random House declined comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej3A7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZltIZl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Orbit set to try and send satellites to space for the first time </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_jlhdjIT6xgoQagmIzdn8u2fs4=/251x0:2816x1710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681015/Virgin_Orbit_87.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Orbit’s airborne rocket-launching system during a previous test.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Virgin Orbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9HVGW"&gt;Virgin Orbit — the sister company of billionaire Richard Branson’s space tourism outfit Virgin Galactic — will try a second test of its small satellite-launching rocket later today, months after it failed to reach orbit during a first attempt. It will also be the first time that the company tries to launch working satellites into space on behalf of NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2r69S"&gt;Sometime after 1PM ET, Virgin Orbit’s customized Boeing 747 will take off from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceport in the Mojave desert&lt;/a&gt; and ascend to 35,000 feet with the satellite-launching rocket attached to its wing. Once it reaches a predetermined location, the rocket is supposed to drop and ignite, taking the small satellites on board the rest of the way into orbit around the Earth. Virgin Orbit says the window for launch will last until 5PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M56MhT"&gt;Virgin Orbit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgin_orbit/status/1350839742900760576?s=21"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Sunday morning that it’s aiming for takeoff at 10:30AM PT (1:30PM ET). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With operations for our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaunchDemo2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LaunchDemo2&lt;/a&gt; mission already in full swing, it's an exciting morning here at Mojave Air and Space Port! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOX loading on the rocket has begun, and we're looking good to hit our target takeoff time of approximately 10:30 AM Pacific. &lt;a href="https://t.co/naBppEJRhD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/naBppEJRhD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Virgin Orbit (@Virgin_Orbit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit/status/1350839742900760576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="XfUnKC"&gt;There is no live stream of the test, though the company plans to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit"&gt;tweet updates&lt;/a&gt; throughout the flight. It will make photos and video available sometime after the test is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iR3DqF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Virgin Orbit has been working on its airborne rocket-launching system for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqBZLu"&gt;Virgin Orbit has spent years developing this method of airborne rocket-launching, and it has performed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20687873/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-drop-test-cosmic-girl-747-california"&gt;increasingly complex&lt;/a&gt; flight tests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102556/virgin-orbit-launcherone-cosmic-girl-captive-carry-test-flight"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. But the first full test of the company’s rocket-launching capabilities in May of last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21265057/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-test-launch-747-airplane-cosmic-girl"&gt;did not go completely as planned&lt;/a&gt;. The plane ascended correctly, the rocket dropped, and the main engine ignited. But a problem in the liquid oxygen fuel line prevented the rocket from reaching orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiSZhY"&gt;Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit’s CEO, said during a conference call earlier this month that the company has made changes to those propellant lines and done an “enormous amount of testing” since May, despite the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlgvXv"&gt;“Watching [Virgin Orbit] rise to the occasion and dive into the details and drive the maturation of the system, and doing it in a pandemic environment, is really amazing to watch,” Hart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTNrbq"&gt;Technical fixes aside, another difference between the previous test and this one is that Virgin Orbit will be attempting to deliver real commercial payloads for a customer for the first time: NASA. The space agency has tasked Virgin Orbit with carrying 10 different small satellites for various universities. Each will perform a variety of missions, from cleaning up space debris, to practicing inspection and maintenance of other spacecraft, to making weather observations. A &lt;a href="https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/announcing-the-window-for-launch-demo-2/"&gt;full list is available on Virgin Orbit’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0xash"&gt;This mission was supposed to take place back in December, but was delayed because some members of Virgin Orbit’s launch team had to quarantine. Hart said Virgin Orbit has “done a huge amount to ensure the safety of the team” ahead of today’s launch. A big part of that is having people work remotely, but for those who have to be on site,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hart said Virgin Orbit is enforcing social distancing, making employees use PPE, disinfecting spaces, and installing&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;air purifiers. “Every single tool that you can imagine that is out there in industry, we have applied, but we have a team that’s eager, that’s focused,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3ISwL"&gt;The launch attempt was rescheduled to earlier this month, though that has slipped a few times now to today’s window. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgin_orbit/status/1350519343147204609?s=21"&gt;tweeted on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that the hardware is “in great shape” and that the weather looks favorable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tk0tVC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="On board Virgin Orbit’s flying launchpad|63519" data-volume-uuid="d897fadf8" data-volume-id="63519" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-396" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtHlgR"&gt;Virgin Orbit’s approach to launching satellites is quite different from that of SpaceX or the other major launch providers that NASA and others typically use. But it’s one that the company believes will help take a bite out of the burgeoning small satellite market. By launching from a plane in the air, Virgin Orbit’s system doesn’t need as big a rocket, or as much fuel, which helps keep costs down. The company argues that this is a potentially more flexible system, since it makes satellite launches theoretically possible from anywhere a 747 can take off and land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQzGUM"&gt;(Those reasons may be why Virgin Orbit has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16648336/virgin-orbit-launcherone-defense-department-cosmic-girl"&gt;inked a contract with the Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;. Virgin Orbit wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906657/virgin-orbit-mars-vehicle-deep-space-satellite-missions-launcherone-satrevolution"&gt;to launch missions to Mars, too&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myTb7I"&gt;But first Virgin Orbit must prove that the system works, and that the company can be profitable. Backers like Branson and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, have sustained it through development so far. The company is now seeking &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-bransons-virgin-orbit-seeks-1-billion-valuation-in-fundraising-11602403201"&gt;up to $200 million in new funding&lt;/a&gt; after spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing the airborne launch system it will test again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aR6nFH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The goal is to become a dedicated launcher for the budding small satellite market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBhNec"&gt;Hart stressed on the call that this is a test flight, and that the company will be “thrilled to get the data” that’s generated along the way so it can continue developing and refining the launch system. He also said the Virgin Orbit team is “mindful that there’s risk on whether we will get to the final orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQciFc"&gt;But Hart said Virgin Orbit has been “working vigorously and looking at all the details and making sure that we have the best shot possible to get to orbit” considering there are real satellites on board this time. That work has included help from an investigation team made up of people from launch partner NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Force, and industry professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sG29gH"&gt;“We really immersed our engineering team with a fresh set of eyes to make sure that basically that we weren’t drinking our own bathwater,” Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79tYJm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 17th, 11:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds updated takeoff time of 1:30PM ET and new tweet from Virgin Orbit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal is back after an outage that lasted more than 24 hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Signal logo seen in the background of a silhouette hand holding a mobile phone. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Q6fKwgcOaTtGETVezT5N5uw358=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68680864/1230608869.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6LQB5"&gt;After experiencing technical difficulties Friday, the Signal messaging app appears to be back up and running. The company tweeted Saturday night that it was “back,” although added that some users may still see error messages in their chats. The company didn’t explain what caused the outage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6DV26M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Signal is back! Like an underdog going through a training montage, we’ve learned a lot since yesterday — and we did it together. Thanks to the millions of new Signal users around the world for your patience. Your capacity for understanding inspired us while we expanded capacity. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cRNV8kVtdF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cRNV8kVtdF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350595202872823809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSBuCZ"&gt;For users still be seeing error messages in their chats — which the company said was a “side effect” of the outage that began around 11:30AM ET Friday—  Signal tweeted that those messages do not affect security, rather that you may have missed a message from another user. This will be fixed in the next app updates, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1csvT"&gt;It offered two fixes if users want to clear the error messages manually: On Android, tap the menu in the top-right corner and choose “reset secure session.” For iOS users of Signal tap the “reset session” button located below “received message was out of sync.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GUa7sA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;On Android if you see "Bad encrypted message," tap the menu in the top-right &amp;amp; tap "Reset secure session." On iOS tap the "Reset Session" button below "Received message was out of sync." The errors do not affect chat security &amp;amp; will be automatically fixed in the next app update. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dgLGLZS3zB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dgLGLZS3zB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350631024351346689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTatZu"&gt;Signal allows secure and encrypted video, voice, and text communication, and in the past weeks has seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;a surge of new users&lt;/a&gt; to its app, after CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;tweeted his recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, and as rival service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;WhatsApp unveiled a confusing new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s now pushed back several months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1W9TY"&gt;During the outage, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350248817304588289?s=20"&gt;Signal  tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it was “working as quickly as possible to bring additional capacity online to handle peak traffic levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDgR52"&gt;The company did not immediately reply to an request from&lt;em&gt; The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for further comment on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Critical NASA rocket test ends early with a shutdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ME0ou86oxttViKL5KzCvSSBcLFc=/210x0:2460x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68679496/Screen_Shot_2021_01_16_at_5.27.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXyk5Y"&gt;A critical NASA rocket test ended with a shutdown on Saturday, a little over a minute into what was planned to be an eight-minute test. This trial run was a vital checkpoint for NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;much-delayed Space Launch System&lt;/a&gt;. The SLS is set to play a key role in the agency’s Artemis program which aims to return astronauts to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lz89gK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22232498/sls-nasa-space-launch-system-green-run-hot-fire"&gt;During today’s Green Run test&lt;/a&gt;, the four rocket engines in the SLS core fired for a little over a minute while anchored in NASA’s rocket test stand. The team had planned to have the engines fire for approximately eight minutes, or about the same amount of time it will take to launch future missions to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pbFMpQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch all four &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_SLS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASA_SLS&lt;/a&gt; core stage engines roar to life and shake the ground in Mississippi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teams are assessing the data on early engine shutdown. &lt;a href="https://t.co/U5bNqqbdZd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/U5bNqqbdZd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA (@NASA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1350573543730372615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNvm2D"&gt;Instead, around a minute into the NASA broadcast of the test, a voice is heard saying “we did get a MCF [major component failure] on engine 4.” At around the same time, engineers spotted a flash near engine four, said John Honeycutt, NASA’s SLS program manager in a press conference. They think that the flash occurred somewhere near a thermal protection blanket around that engine. The exact cause of the shutdown is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvVz07"&gt;A blog post from NASA said that the flight software ended the test. “At this point, the test was fully automated. During the firing, the onboard software acted appropriately and initiated a safe shutdown of the engines,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/01/16/green-run-update-hot-fire-conducted-on-jan-16/"&gt;the statement from NASA says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEZbr1"&gt;The engineering team had hoped to get at least 250 seconds of the hot fire test, John Shannon the SLS program manager at Boeing, said a press conference earlier this week.  “[If] we had an early shutdown, for whatever reason, we get all of the engineering data we need to have high confidence in the vehicle at about 250 seconds” said Shannon. During that time they planned to have the engines move through a series of maneuvers designed to test the responsiveness of the engines while they were lit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UPzIk"&gt;It appears that they got far less than the 250 seconds of data that they hoped for. The data that they did manage to get was gathered by about 1,400 sensors during the test. Among other things, the sensors monitored the core for vibration, temperature, acoustics, and stress. Even though the test was cut short, those sensors did gather a lot of data that may eventually help NASA determine the path forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYsyZ7"&gt;“Not everything went according to script today, but we got a lot of great data,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a press conference after the event. “I have absolutely total confidence in the team to figure out what what the anomaly was figure out how to fix it, and then get after it again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I91rDX"&gt;The SLS has been in development for years, and was originally scheduled to make its flight debut in 2017. Instead, it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;plagued by delays and is massively over budget&lt;/a&gt;. NASA had previously pushed back the rocket’s debut to November 2021, and was still hoping to make that launch date, &lt;a href="https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/sls-green-run-tests-slip-but-november-2021-remains-artemis-i-target/"&gt;even after a December 2020 delay in their testing schedule&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX8izB"&gt;The rocket being tested today was slated to be part of that first launch out of Cape Canaveral — an &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/around-the-moon-with-nasa-s-first-launch-of-sls-with-orion"&gt;uncrewed mission called Artemis I&lt;/a&gt; that would send NASA’s Orion spacecraft around the moon. It’s still unclear what exactly triggered the shutdown, and how the results of today’s test might affect the timeline for Artemis I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhUXDv"&gt;“It depends what the anomaly was and how challenging it’s going to be to fix it. And we’ve got a lot to learn to figure that out.” Bridenstine said. ”I think it very well could be that it’s something that’s easily fixable and we can feel confident going down to the Cape and staying on schedule. It’s also true that we could find a challenge that’s going to take more time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OT7lyC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story has been updated with information from a NASA press conference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook suspends ads for weapon accessories until at least January 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eJssl52IotG8Ldzx_pFGwGDclUw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678969/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8lsV24"&gt;Facebook has updated its Inauguration Day preparations to include a temporary ban on ads that promote weapon accessories and protective equipment at least through January 22nd “out of an abundance of caution,”  &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/"&gt;the company said in a new blog post Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. “We already prohibit ads for weapons, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers. But we will now also prohibit ads for accessories such as gun safes, vests and gun holsters in the US,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj1uNN"&gt;The ban comes after Facebook was criticized for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/"&gt;allowing posts across its platforms&lt;/a&gt; that promoted and organized the deadly January 6th attack on the Capitol building. The ads for military gear such as body armor and gun holsters ran next to Facebook and Instagram posts about the insurrection at the Capitol that included calls for violence, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-pauses-ads-for-gun-accessories-and-military-gear"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhPq2D"&gt;A group of &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/lawmakers-attorneys-general-facebook-weapon-ads"&gt;US senators wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, urging the company to “develop and execute a Facebook policy permanently prohibiting advertisements of products... primarily designed for use in lethal tactical operations and armed combat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXevSu"&gt;Facebook has tightened its policies amid concerns that there may be more violence in the nation’s capital ahead of the January 20th inauguration.  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233871/facebook-blocking-events-white-house-us-state-capitols-inauguration-day"&gt;The company says it won’t allow&lt;/a&gt; users to create events taking place “in close proximity” to the White House, the Capitol, or state capital buildings through Inauguration Day.  Facebook also said it was doing a “secondary review” of any inauguration-related events created on its platform and will remove any that violate its rules. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford reportedly delays some deliveries of its Mustang Mach-E</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwEYHT"&gt;Ford will delay deliveries for hundreds of its Mustang Mach-E vehicles to perform quality checks, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/15/ford-delays-hundreds-mustang-mach-e-deliveries-additional-quality-checks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker began delivering the Mach-E SUV in December, but some buyers reported that their upcoming delivery dates had been pushed back, by as long as a month in some cases, according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M64zPh"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E SUV is Ford’s first update to the iconic Mustang brand ever, and the company’s biggest foray into the EV marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="x2Dcw4"&gt;Ford did not say what specifically prompted the new quality checks, but the company told the &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/01/ford-issues-mustang-mach-e-stop-ship-to-address-quality-related-issue/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ford Authority&lt;/em&gt; blog&lt;/a&gt; that it was working to expedite deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E, “and we hope that customers receive them ahead of targeted dates, providing there are no COVID-19-related transportation delays.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Twitter employees have reportedly locked their accounts fearing reprisal from Trump supporters</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnXLve"&gt;Some Twitter employees have set their accounts to private and scrubbed their online biographies over concerns they may be targeted by supporters of President Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/inside-twitter-decision-trump.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; In addition, some Twitter executives have been assigned personal security as the company reckons with its decision to bar one of its loudest voices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toSQFU"&gt;Trump’s @realDonaldTrump account was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently suspended from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; January 8th, “due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in its statement&lt;/a&gt;. The president &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/trump-speech-riot.html"&gt;told supporters at a rally&lt;/a&gt; just before an attack on the Capitol January 6th they would “have to show strength,” and “fight much harder,” encouraging them to walk down to the Capitol. &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump"&gt;Trump tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Vice President Mike Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done,” and later — while the attack was still ongoing— tweeted “we love you” to his supporters. The House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-impeached.html"&gt;impeached Trump&lt;/a&gt; a second time on January 13th for “incitement of insurrection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHnHFW"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who was working remotely from a private island the day the riot occurred, was not totally convinced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;a temporary ban on the president&lt;/a&gt; that day was the right decision. Twitter executives told Dorsey that the response to Trump’s tweets in the day after the riot suggested there was great potential for more real-world violence, ultimately leading to the permanent suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtS36p"&gt;More than 300 Twitter employees had signed an internal petition calling for a permanent Trump suspension, but according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, the company had already decided at that point to ban the president. After Twitter announced its ban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230001/snapchat-trump-ban-permanently-account-january-20th-innaguration-snap"&gt;Snapchat issued its own permanent ban&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put indefinite bans&lt;/a&gt; on President Trump’s accounts. Facebook said in a statement explaining its decision, “The risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service... are simply too great.” In addition, Shopify took down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt;, a main source of sales of Make America Great Again hats and other merch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFNWNn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510777254756352"&gt;In a tweet thread Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Dorsey said that banning Trump’s account was the right call. “Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all,” he wrote, adding that Twitter should “look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement.” &lt;/p&gt;
