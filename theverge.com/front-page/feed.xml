    <title>Razer’s 2022 Blade laptops are more refined but mostly the same</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade gaming laptops" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN6zODG-YxRDsDdeHXEx-JgU0tU=/0x0:3521x2347/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346349/bladetri.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qs9wS5"&gt;Razer isn’t using CES 2022 as a moment to show off a bold, new laptop concept. Instead, it’s asserting its dominance in the gaming laptop world by announcing refreshed Blade laptops that are barely different on the outside but with marked improvements on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upQ6xB"&gt;Starting with the biggest updates, the Blade 14, Blade 15, and Blade 17 each feature the jump to faster DDR5 RAM (Razer’s goes up to 4,800MHz), along with support for AMD’s latest Ryzen 9, or Intel’s new 12th Gen processors, depending on the model you want. Additionally, Razer’s 2022 update will offer support for up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3070 Ti and the 3080 Ti mobile graphics chip. You’re likely to find these specs in many gaming laptops being announced during this year’s trade show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JGTE7C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia announces 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti laptop GPUs, says they can control your CPU, too","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22865535/nvidia-3080-ti-3070-ti-mobile-laptop-max-q-intel-amd-alder-lake-rembrandt"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tuyQLn"&gt;In the past couple of years, Razer has made worthwhile upgrades to the Blade lineup, including refining the keyboard layout, boosting the webcam resolution from 720p to 1080p in some models (all of the early 2022 models have a 1080p Windows Hello webcam), and finishing each of its laptops with a more fingerprint-resistant coating. This year’s across-the-board refinement — those specs above aside — includes a larger keyboard with bigger keycaps, and laser-cut speaker grills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maWJdC"&gt;I’m going to dive into each of the models to cover the specs and prices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 14 (early 2022)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRTuKUlKPML0zp4yI4kEDfsCIiY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129973/blade14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MHnsjb"&gt;The Blade 14 for 2022 supports up to AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 6900HX octa-core processor with 16GB of DDR5 RAM (which is soldered on, though its 1TB SSD is replaceable). It starts with the Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip and a 1080p IPS panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, but Razer offers two QHD 165Hz refresh rate panel options that can be configured with the RTX 3070 Ti or the RTX 3080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNQNvT"&gt;The Blade 14 has an MUX switch that lets it switch between the integrated Radeon 680M graphics and the dedicated GPU. It also now has a 61.6Wh battery and includes a 230W power adapter. It will start at $1,999.99, and preorders will open first at Razer on February 10th, with availability beginning sometime in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 (early 2022)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oVn4zdATTgQeN-l51MMwL3Ty00A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23129968/razerblade15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pTEe6Q"&gt;Moving on, Razer is simplifying the naming convention for its Blade 15 and Blade 17 laptops, leaving the names at that instead of appending “Pro,” “Advanced,” or “Base,” which I’m sure confused some customers, including myself at times. Both the Blade 15 and 17 use Intel’s 12th Gen Core i7-12800H 14-core processor (and with it, gain two Thunderbolt 4 ports, whereas the Blade 14 has USB-C), and both models come with 1TB of upgradeable storage (dual M.2 slot, each supporting up to 2TB) and 16GB of upgradeable DDR5 RAM (supporting up to 64GB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DRqC7F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD is still nowhere to be found on the Blade 15 / 17&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B8JqMQ"&gt;The Blade 15 and 17 each start with QHD panels and the RTX 3060 graphics chip at $2,499.99 and $2,699.99, respectively, but each can go up to a 4K IPS panel with 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, upgrade to the Intel Core i9-12900HK processor, and pack in Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti if you’ve got the cash to spend. The top-end Blade 15 costs $3,999.99, and the Blade 17 tops out at $4,299.99. The Blade 15 has an 80Wh battery and comes with a 230W adapter, while the Blade 17 has an 82Wh battery and comes with a 280W GaN charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovulme"&gt;If you want to preorder the Blade 15 or 17, you can do so starting January 25th from Razer, and both models will be available sometime in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC8aWA"&gt;All of these changes and spec improvements seem fine, but I wish that Razer would give people the option to opt for AMD’s processors in the Blade 15 and Blade 17. The Blade 14 is a beast of a mini laptop, yet it’s unclear why its AMD partnership is limited to the company’s most niche laptop and not across its entire portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s portable 4K projector runs Android TV and brings its own speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfGcjklSOolgjDVk0E8jHtKFg4o=/0x47:1900x1314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346346/nebula_4k_projector.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anker’s Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cOakUi"&gt;Anker sub-brand Nebula has a new projector that runs Android TV 10.0 called the Cosmos Laser 4K. It’s designed to be portable with a pair of 30W speakers baked right in for spontaneous gaming or movie nights wherever you might be. The ALPD 3.0 laser tech can project 4K images at 2400 ANSI lumens. That’s respectable, but likely too dim to produce a decent image in anything but a darkened room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFuPyb"&gt;It unfortunately looks like it won’t run Netflix natively, just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798489/xgimi-aura-projector-review-price-specs"&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548487/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-hdr-review-projector-portable-specs-price"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; Android TV 10.0 projectors we’ve reviewed. Instead Anker says the Cosmos Laser comes with a “4K streaming dongle” to push content off your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MS0FW5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;3 second autofocus and keystone correction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zVZaG"&gt;Other features include fast (3 second) autofocus and automatic keystone correction which are niceties in a projector meant to be moved around, as well as eye-guard tech to cut the laser to protect the curious gaze of pets and kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="612vl1"&gt;Anker says that the all-in-one Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K projector will debut on kickstarter January 11th for $2,199 / £2,199 / €2,199 before shipping in March. That’s relatively expensive compared to similarly specced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548487/xgimi-horizon-pro-4k-hdr-review-projector-portable-specs-price"&gt;4K all-in-ones priced at $1,699&lt;/a&gt;, but will hold any judgement pending reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eufy’s new video doorbell uses two cameras to catch porch pirates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k-i9nnZmX6InG3CGFG83N-ahN5o=/375x0:2625x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346347/eufy_doorbell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual uses two cameras to keep an eye on your front door.﻿&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aAXM9v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV40dq"&gt;Eufy, Anker’s smart home brand, is trying to solve the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;video doorbell’s&lt;/a&gt; biggest blindspot with a new dual-camera option. The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual has two cameras: a 2K camera up top to capture the face and body of a visitor and a 1080p camera down below to monitor packages left on the doorstep. At CES 2022 this week, the company also announced a new Garage Cam, which is a garage door controller and camera in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL0wes"&gt;The concept of two cameras in a video doorbell is an interesting one, helping solve the problem most camera doorbells have where they either show you a tall, skinny video so you can see packages as well as people, but not much context outside that. Or, you get a wide view that gives more context but misses out on the doorstep itself, where those packages normally are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McVqu3"&gt;This Eufy Video Doorbell Dual, which costs $350, including the required Homebase 2, is not the first to attempt this type of two-camera solution. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetkuna.com%2Fproducts%2Fanswer-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kuna Maximus Answer&lt;/a&gt; also does double duty. However, that’s a hardwired doorbell; Eufy’s version is the first battery-powered buzzer to try this trick. Its downward-facing 1080p camera has a 120-degree field of view, while the 2K camera can see as wide as 160 degrees. It also has AI that can detect packages, plus a new “Family Recognition” feature that uses AI to recognize friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlBYcT"&gt;In addition to dual cameras, the doorbell has dual motion detection, using radar and PIR technology to detect people versus motion and reduce false alerts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKwxTY"&gt;As with all Eufy cameras, there is no required monthly subscription fee. When paired with a Eufy hub — the HomeBase 2 — 16GB of local storage provides up to 90 days of video recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLaA2Z"&gt;The Eufy Dual should last up to six months on a charge, and based on my testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464940/eufy-anker-solocam-security-cameras-local-storage-battery-no-hub"&gt;Eufy cameras&lt;/a&gt; in the past, this battery life largely pans out. Although if you have a very busy front door, it’s more like four months. However, the addition of a second camera could have a significant impact on battery life. Prior &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.eufylife.com%2Fproducts%2Fe82101w3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy battery-operated doorbells&lt;/a&gt; could be used wired as well; we’ve asked the company if this is also the case with the Dual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hn6Omb"&gt;The Eufy Dual will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt; smart home platforms and is scheduled to launch on February 8th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JfzoUSf7-cYmoAdncLM6cPaWChU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144211/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.56.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eufy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Garage-Control Cam combines a garage door controller and camera into one device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BRjofI"&gt;The other new product announced this week is the Eufy Security Garage-Control Cam and the Cam Plus. These are all-in-one garage control and surveillance devices that can be used to remotely open / close the garage door, as well as visually check in on your garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mSJXT"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam offers 1080p video and can control one door, and the Cam Plus has 2K video and can control up to two doors. They both pair with door sensors to detect the status of the door and send an alert if you forget to close it. It’s not clear if the devices need to be hardwired to your existing garage door opener or which garage door manufacturers the product will be compatible with. We’ve reached out to Eufy for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1duZ7d"&gt;As with other garage door controllers — such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chamberlain.com%2Fmyq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chamberlain’s MyQ &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://gotailwind.com/"&gt;Tailwind IQ3&lt;/a&gt; — the Garage Control Cam lets you open and close your garage door remotely using the app or with voice control. Eufy also has the option of geofencing detection, so you can set the door to open or close as you arrive or leave home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTatIS"&gt;Both Cam devices can distinguish between humans, vehicles, and general motion using on-device AI, and they don’t require a Eufy hub. Instead, 32GB of local storage using an SD card provides video recordings with no monthly cloud storage fees. The cameras also support 24/7 continuous recording with a 4-second pre-roll feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx56hU"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam (1080P/ single-door control) will cost $99 and the Garage-Control Cam Plus (2K/ two-door control) $129, and both are expected to launch in March of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BUZJh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hisense floods the zone with TVs at every price point for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cgP7XKisILiCMOyCzT9aOxMck0E=/0x7:1772x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346368/hisense.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hisense&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TBCeUW"&gt;Hisense is one of those brands that’s easy to sleep on when you’re shopping for a new TV. But over the last few years, the company has built a strong reputation for delivering much better picture quality than you’d typically expect from TVs that sell at similar prices. And for 2022, Hisense is trying to offer a TV that won’t disappoint regardless of your budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEhgpg"&gt;At the top of the heap of this year’s “ULED” TVs is the flagship U9H Series. It’s got Mini LED backlighting (with over 1,280 dimming zones), quantum dot HDR, a peak brightness of 2,000 nits, support for 4K gaming at 120Hz, FreeSync variable refresh rate, and an upgraded processor for improved responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwHzdR"&gt;Under that comes the U8H, the latest in the well-reviewed U8 series, and the one Hisense is positioning as its “best all-around TV.” The peak HDR brightness drops some to 1,500 nits, but you’re still getting the revamped Mini LED backlighting, all the expected gaming features, and a wide net of supported video modes that includes Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, FilmMaker Mode, and others. Also new for 2022 is a larger 75-inch size for the U8H Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUggGZ"&gt;Stepping down from there, you get the U7H Series. It drops Mini LED, which isn’t unexpected for the $799.99 starting price. But it still includes a 120Hz variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and other gaming perks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aAYwQw"&gt; U9H ships in late summer for $3,199.99 (75-inch model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W9Q3hr"&gt;U8H ships in mid-summer starting at $1,099 and available in 55-, 65-, and 75-inch sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uTqcL8"&gt;U7H ships in mid-summer starting at $799.99 and comes in 55-, 65-, 75-, and 85-inch sizes, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ8K9a"&gt;Hisense’s TVs will come with Google TV onboard and include built-in mics for hands-free voice commands. The company is also announcing a range of lower-cost TVs plus projectors and soundbars at CES 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Now will be limited to 1080p on Samsung and LG TVs — for now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7jqJ3GLUdssHZXupj4rnQPX12E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346340/GAMINGHUB_LANDINGPAGE_3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3M4SiK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22862814/samsung-2022-tv-geforce-now-stadia-nvidia-google-utomik-cloud-gaming"&gt;Samsung and LG have embraced cloud gaming this winter&lt;/a&gt; with support for Google Stadia and Nvidia’s GeForce Now in their television sets — but neither brand of TV will include Nvidia’s best quality streams for now. Nvidia cloud gaming boss Phil Eisler confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that TVs will start at 1080p, and it sounds like the company’s 4K HDR streams will stay exclusive to the company’s own Nvidia Shield TV set-top through the first half of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NC9zTy"&gt;But afterward, that may change — depending on your TV’s processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teL4Eq"&gt;“The TVs use many different SOCs with different performance levels capable of decoding our streams at 60 FPS, so we’re focused on 1080p first,” Eisler explains. “We’ve rolled that out with LG first in December and with Samsung models in the first half of 2022, and will increase resolutions in the second half of 2022 as we continue to optimize for those decoding applications,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tM46cE"&gt;Google confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge &lt;/em&gt;yesterday that its own Stadia cloud gaming service will offer 4K streams on both LG and Samsung TVs (Samsung had not previously made that clear), though it’s probably good to note that Stadia’s definition of “4K” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;has been a little bit suspect ever since the service launched&lt;/a&gt;. It often refers to the resolution of Stadia’s stream itself, rather than the internal render resolution of its games. The “4K” version of &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; on Stadia is actually upsampled 1080p, for example. GeForce Now has had its own weaknesses, though, as I explained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;in my hands-on with Nvidia’s RTX 3080 tier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nUfqc"&gt;During Nvidia’s CES 2022 press conference today, it said that cloud gaming in general is expected to grow to 100 million subscribers by 2024 and announced that AT&amp;amp;T 5G customers can get a free six-month membership of its GeForce Now “Priority” tier. That’s the 1080p one that runs on the cloud equivalent of RTX 2080 (not 3080) video cards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia announces RTX 3090 Ti with faster memory and performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uOfvd3CS8x9dQqm6Tocs-SORbXM=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346242/chrome_tHrcoTnakt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyV5sT"&gt;Nvidia is announcing a new flagship GPU today, the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti. While the wait continues for Nvidia’s Ampere successor, the RTX 3090 Ti is here to prove Nvidia can still squeeze more performance out of its existing 8nm GA102 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNGLau"&gt;Nvidia is only teasing the RTX 3090 Ti today, and it’s the familiar-looking triple-slot design we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;seen on the RTX 3090&lt;/a&gt;. Both cards may look identical, but inside, the new RTX 3090 Ti will include 24GB of GDDR6X running at 21Gbps. That’s the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 3090 but with a nearly 7.7 percent faster memory clock, providing additional performance for 4K gaming and AI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1v612G8buoKN617MU0ujxqKVhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144597/85lXfjr.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fggJVl"&gt;Nvidia says the RTX 3090 Ti will also include 40 teraflops of GPU performance, around 11 percent faster than the RTX 3090 with 36 teraflops. There’s also 78 teraflops for ray tracing and 320 teraflops for AI tasks. Nvidia hasn’t detailed base and boost clocks, but it certainly looks like the RTX 3090 Ti will be around 10 percent faster than the RTX 3090 on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaXKrW"&gt;Just how much this extra performance will impact power requirements isn’t clear yet, either. &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-pictured-specifications-confirmed"&gt;Rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the RTX 3090 Ti could require a 1000W PSU, with a TDP of 450 watts. If accurate, that’s 100W more than the RTX 3090 in terms of power draw and a big bump to the 750W recommended PSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PCOZz"&gt;All of these numbers mean very little without game benchmarks or pricing, though. Nvidia isn’t sharing these details today, so we’ll have to wait on detailed reviews to see how well this card performs against the RTX 3090 and AMD’s Radeon RX 6900 XT. Given the RTX 3090 debuted for $1,499, we wouldn’t be surprised if the RTX 3090 Ti launches around the $2,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mmmFU"&gt;Nvidia is promising more details on the RTX 3090 Ti later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP announces new Elitebooks with Ryzen Pro 6000 processors and 16:10 screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rH6uFJ5tgSkMP3419Gp4YKnCbcA=/0x0:6570x4380/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346233/HP_EliteBook_835_G9_Workspace_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP’s new Elitebooks have AMD’s latest mobile processors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NlZKXO"&gt;HP has announced a redesign of its Elitebook 805 laptops, which will soon include AMD’s Ryzen Pro 6000 processors and screens with the taller-than-standard 16:10 aspect ratio appreciated by businesspeople who spend their days scrolling through documents. HP has also announced a new Elitebook 605 series, which comes equipped with more mundane processors and screens (though for IT departments buying dozens at a time, that’s probably not such a bad thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbebHv"&gt;This year’s Elitebook 805 G9 laptops come in three variations: the 835, 845, and 865. The middle number refers to the laptop’s screen size: the 835 has a 13.3-inch screen, the 845 has a 14-inch screen, and the 865 has a 16-inch screen, which is a new option for the series. Specs-wise, the 805 G9s can be configured with similar options regardless of screen size, though there are two asterisks: one is that the 13-inch model can only be configured with a max of 16GB of DDR5 RAM, where the 845 and 865 top out at 64GB. HP’s spec sheets also note that the larger laptops have “customer-accessible / upgradable” memory slots, whereas the 835 does not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sCNXIxepHOcXujN3Tmb41isvSlI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142957/HP_EliteBook_835_G9_Front_Right.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compared to the trackpad on the previous-gen 805s, the G9s’ mousing surface is centered and doesn’t have left/right-click buttons above it. It also matches the new 16:10 aspect ratio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RjGsVx"&gt;The second asterisk is about CPUs. While HP says that the laptops will be equipped with the “latest AMD Ryzen multi-core processors,” it doesn’t give specifics — only that they’ll be in the Ryzen Pro 6000 family. Those processors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22620191"&gt;were just announced today&lt;/a&gt;, so it could be a little while before we find out which models will be options for the different 805 G9-series Elitebooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5twpp"&gt;All the sizes support Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and PCIe Gen4x4 SSDs (though with a 2TB max listed in the spec sheet). The I/O also seems decent — two USB-A 3.1 G1 ports (which is the ridiculous and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/27/18243425/usb-3-2-standard-names-connectivity-cables-innovators-forum"&gt;slightly outdated name&lt;/a&gt; to describe the original USB 3.0 spec that runs at 5Gbps), two USB4 Type-C ports, an HDMI 2.0 port, a headphone / microphone combo jack, and a nano SIM slot for if you’ve added the optional LTE modem. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYkvfgzt4c378GLyS4jlZyKCKiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142956/HP_EliteBook_835_G9_Stacked_Profile.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 805 G9s’ I/O has most of the ports people are looking for. And while HDMI 2.0 isn’t the latest and greatest, it’s probably fine for a business-focused laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SyIBoo"&gt;The screens may be a bit of a bummer, though — while they do have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;the lovely 16:10 aspect ratio&lt;/a&gt;, there doesn’t seem to be any option to spec them higher than 1920x1200 (nor does HP make any mention of touch capabilities). While that resolution may be OK for the 13-inch version (if you haven’t been spoiled been by better screens in the past), that’s not a lot of pixels for a 16-inch screen being released in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="owhdLZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Goodbye and good riddance to the 16:9 aspect ratio","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UgPtgY"&gt;Battery size will be either from 38, 51, or 76 watt-hours, depending on the laptop’s size and configuration, but HP says the new Ryzen chips offer “impressive battery life” along with “incredible performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bH7IKsJuqYgdQrMoauJrPoHq7Ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143268/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_15.52.00.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP positions the Elitebook 655 G9 as “a cost-effective, powerful, and highly secure PC” for enterprise fleets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YmGlIo"&gt;HP also announced two other models: the Elitebook 645 and 655. The company doesn’t explicitly say it, but the 605 G9-series seems to be lower-end than the 805 series; the laptops use a barrel plug for power (though USB-C is an option if you’ve got an appropriate power brick), and you can only get them with 14 or 15.6-inch screens, both of which are 16:9 instead of 16:10. They’re also equipped with older &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332692/amd-ryzen-pro-5000-mobile-processors-business-laptops"&gt;Ryzen 5000 processors&lt;/a&gt; though those still aren’t anything to sneeze at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ5s0L"&gt;The company says the 605s are “destined to be an IT and user favorite,” though users and IT departments don’t always see eye-to-eye. For example, if IT is buying a fleet of laptops, it may not want to shell out for upgraded screens — but with this laptop, that leaves users with a sub-1080p TN panel (the base screen is listed as an unspecified “HD” resolution, while the next step up is an IPS screen with “FHD,” or full HD, resolution). While that type of display still plagues business laptops, it really should have been left in the 2010s — and certainly has no place on computers that start at $1,149. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XD08DM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10960057"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QaP8Lu"&gt;With an upgrade to a 1080p screen, though, the picture gets better for these laptops (pun intended). Like the 805 G9 series, there’s a decent selection of ports — one Thunderbolt 4/USB4, HDMI, ethernet, a combo headphone and microphone jack, and three USB-A 3.1 Gen1 ports. (The number of USB-A ports is according to the images provided by HP — the spec sheets for both the 645 and 655 say there are two ports, one on each side. The pictures disagree.) Both models also support up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM and can be configured with an additional Gen3 NVMe SSD to go alongside the up-to Gen4x4 main one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNVfpzjMiwoHk5lWOsjiyryBWkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142958/HP_EliteBook_645_G9_Stacked_Profile.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using a barrel plug as the default power source is less modern than USB-C, but it’s hard to complain about built-in ethernet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Woat7b"&gt;HP’s press release says that the Elitebook G9 6-series will become available late this month and that the 805 G9s will be available sometime in April. Pricing for those will be announced closer to the release date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia announces 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti laptop GPUs, says they can control your CPU, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D0v9pwDnIFnZt6aYNdyPdvEe86M=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346214/chrome_gwZLTSIihk.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61Lxtq"&gt;Nvidia’s virtual CES 2022 keynote is underway, and the company’s just announced a new slate of gaming laptop chips there — including mobile versions of the RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti that’ll appear in laptops starting at $1,499 and $2,499, respectively. They’ll be out February 1st from the typical array of partners including Alienware and Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmhmdp6umSn-6Sp_vSd5gNaW7vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144576/chrome_MtQmNzsoUF.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="geM6FW"&gt;While the company isn’t sharing a lot of specs just yet — only that they’ll offer Ultra-spec 1440p gaming at 100 and 120 frames per second, respectively, and that the 3080 Ti is faster than a desktop Titan RTX — Nvidia has something up its sleeves that might make this latest slate a little different than previous laptop gens. The company claims its fourth-gen Max-Q platform comes with the ability &lt;em&gt;to control your laptop’s CPU&lt;/em&gt;, changing its performance, power, and temperature as needed to open up headroom for your Nvidia GPU instead. That makes some sense — far more games are GPU limited than CPU limited these days. (I ran a five-year-old CPU in modern games until just this past month, with little effect on frame rates.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJ5O5l9FmNy8BtYk7I-61Cq8k-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144570/chrome_HHAaRQrF6N.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fvt4xA"&gt;Nvidia says it worked with both CPU vendors to create “a new low-level framework” to control specific “next-gen CPUs” — namely Intel Alder Lake and AMD Rembrandt chips, Nvidia confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If you’ve got a Max-Q system with those CPUs and an Nvidia RTX 3000-series graphics chip, there’s a good chance it might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hkNKGM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Insert slight skepticism here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NExNru"&gt;That said, it’s not clear how much it might matter, or how you’d even tell if it’s working. Nvidia didn’t offer any particular performance claims around the new CPU Optimizer feature, and it’s not the only boost it’s touting from fourth-gen Max-Q. There’s also “Rapid Core Scaling” which can turn off some GPU cores while overclocking others for an “up to 3x” performance boost, and a “Battery Boost 2.0” that can theoretically offer up to 70 percent more battery life. (Though if it works anything like the original Battery Boost, that may mean intentionally limiting your game’s frame rate to save that battery life.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOWk39aRJ-m3oNZPAofi_7RCEvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144578/chrome_f7Aaw3RcHu.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vUlisc"&gt;Without knowing more about how the laptop-grade RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti perform, it’s hard to say whether it’s time to buy a new gaming laptop to get one, but we’ll have news and reviews around those individual laptops before long. For now, Nvidia’s GeForce marketing head Matt Wuebbling says they’re roughly 10 to 20 percent faster than their non-Ti counterparts, though it may depend on the model and the laptop they’re in. Like previous RTX 3000 laptop chips, they’ll come in different clock speeds and wattages, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;you’ll have to rely on manufacturer fine print&lt;/a&gt; to know what you’re getting. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243065/nvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency"&gt;It’s possible to buy a 3080 laptop that’s slower than a 3070 laptop&lt;/a&gt;, and that might be the case again here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5dANpBuu1zV4pdF3bnfhL2TURQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144575/chrome_knUNHnAWGs.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eCuqCK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:57 AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Intel Alder Lake and AMD Rembrandt chips specifically are the ones that can be addressed, and that the RTX 3080 Ti and 3070 Ti mobile chips are roughly 10 to 20 percent faster than non Ti versions according to Nvidia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fusion 5G arrives on AT&amp;amp;T’s shelves this Friday, January 7th.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lDLnWO"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/fusion-5g-arrives-january.html"&gt;has announced the Fusion 5G&lt;/a&gt;, a budget phone with a couple of features previously reserved for much more expensive devices: mmWave 5G and wireless charging. It will cost $219 (or $6.12 per month if you’d rather go that route) when it goes on sale this Friday, January 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1BGcf"&gt;Support for mmWave is a bit rare in the under-$300 class — many budget phones only offer the more common but (currently) mediocre sub-6GHz 5G rather than faster but hard-to-find mmWave. In fact, back in the heady, early days of 5G in the US, phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495895/verizon-pixel-4a-5g-uw-exclusive-model-white-price"&gt;like the Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; were sold in two variants: a cheaper version with sub-6GHz only and a more expensive one with mmWave. A couple of years later, it’s still tough to find a mmWave signal, but at least you don’t have to pay more for a phone that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5WwQZ"&gt;Wireless charging is a notable inclusion, too, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22425011/zte-blade-11-prime-review-price-specs-screen"&gt;not entirely unheard of&lt;/a&gt; in a budget phone. Like mmWave, it’s a formerly flagship-only feature that’s still somewhat uncommon even in midrange devices. Other specs include a 6.82-inch display, 4,750mAh battery, 48-megapixel rear main camera, and 64GB of built-in storage. It ships with Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bN1SKE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s still tough to find a mmWave signal, but at least you don’t have to pay more for a phone that supports it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saRmrX"&gt;While mmWave is a nice inclusion on paper for the price, realistically most Fusion 5G owners will be connecting to sub-6GHz 5G. AT&amp;amp;T hasn’t been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251115/verison-5g-ultra-wideband-mmwave-coverage-double-2021"&gt;as aggressive as Verizon&lt;/a&gt; in building out its mmWave network. Unless you spend a significant amount of your time in NFL stadiums or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577093/att-5g-plus-mmwave-boingo-airport"&gt;certain parts of certain airport terminals&lt;/a&gt;, you may never come across a mmWave signal. In any case, sub-6GHz 5G will slowly get better when AT&amp;amp;T begins lighting up its new, faster C-band spectrum — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22866098/faa-dot-verizon-fcc-att-5g-c-band-delay-airplane-safety"&gt;won’t happen for a couple more weeks&lt;/a&gt; at least.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s new $249 RTX 3050 GPU offers ray tracing and DLSS on a budget</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNCPuOU6VauZvMoPVkXTZuRHgTE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346187/RTX_3050_Image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rneQau"&gt;Nvidia has a new budget GPU king, announced at CES 2022: the RTX 3050, which starts at $249 and undercuts the company’s previous entry-level RTX graphics card, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280277/nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card-release-date-time"&gt;the $329 RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;, by a solid $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuCFX4"&gt;As with the other RTX GPUs, the RTX 3050 is built on Nvidia’s Ampere architecture and promises to offer the company’s most affordable entry to ray-traced gaming at 60fps (albeit at 1080p), along with 8GB of GDDR6 memory. The RTX 3050 also offers Nvidia’s third-generation Tensor cores to enable things like its AI-based DLSS upscaling, despite the lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IH7NdTN8eA1Dh4AkhSDAOR650bk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144548/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_11.17.58_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CnxagY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new entry-level GPU from Nvidia... if you can find one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJj4Po"&gt;According to Matt Wuebbling, Nvidia’s VP of global GeForce marketing, 75 percent of customers are still using the company’s old GTX platform. Adding an even cheaper entry-level option like the RTX 3050 is intended to help alleviate that by offering an affordable path for gamers to upgrade from more dated cards like the GTX 1650, GTX 1050 Ti, or GTX 1050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0LiUh"&gt;As with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no Nvidia-built Founder’s Edition model here, so you’ll have to pick up a card from one of Nvidia’s partners instead. And while Nvidia promises that the RTX 3050 will &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; start at $249, you’ll have to find a partner selling a card at that price. That’s assuming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;you can actually find one at all&lt;/a&gt;, given the difficulty in buying a GPU these days thanks to skyrocketing demand and the ongoing semiconductor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
