    <title>TikTok’s parent company acquires VR headset maker Pico</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pico Neo 3 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDtcCeS1spNipnFMdje8N7VedwA=/0x0:940x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793264/m_carousel_neo3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tmccad"&gt;TikTok parent company ByteDance is acquiring Chinese virtual reality headset maker Pico. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-acquires-pico-and-takes-first-step-into-virtual-reality.html"&gt;CNBC confirmed the news&lt;/a&gt; today after it was rumored last week and verified by Chinese &lt;a href="https://news.nweon.com/88799"&gt;publication &lt;em&gt;Nweon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ByteDance told CNBC in a statement that Pico’s “comprehensive suite of software and hardware technologies, as well as the talent and deep expertise of the team, will support both our entry to the VR space and long-term investment in this emerging field,” saying it was “optimistic about the future of VR and its alignment with our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ti8Bih"&gt;Pico is known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13511680/pico-neo-vr-headset-controller-specs-hands-on"&gt;Neo lineup&lt;/a&gt; of standalone virtual reality headsets, most recently the &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/05/pre-order-enterprise-ready-pico-neo-3-starting-from-699/"&gt;Pico Neo 3&lt;/a&gt;. It caters to &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/05/pre-order-enterprise-ready-pico-neo-3-starting-from-699/"&gt;both consumer and professional&lt;/a&gt; customers, and &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210630005150/en/Facebook-Leads-the-VR-Headset-Market-in-Q1-2021-But-Theres-Plenty-of-Room-for-Others-According-to-IDC"&gt;a June IDC report&lt;/a&gt; estimates that Pico is the third largest maker of VR headsets, following Facebook subsidiary Oculus and Chinese company DPVR. While the consumer-focused Neo 3 launched exclusively in Asia, Pico is slowly expanding its market, with the &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/pico-neo-3-pro-eye-release-date-price/"&gt;business-ready Neo 3 Pro and Neo 3 Pro Eye&lt;/a&gt; set for a North American and European release as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTVq9x"&gt;ByteDance is known primarily as a social app company, thanks to global juggernaut TikTok and China-based Douyin. As CNBC notes, however, it also acquired the major &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/bytedance-takes-on-tencent-with-major-gaming-studio-acquisition.html"&gt;mobile games studio Moonton&lt;/a&gt; in March. It’s got experience releasing hardware as well, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20947721/tiktok-bytedance-smartisan-jianguo-pro-3-release-date-china-price-features"&gt;launched a China-exclusive mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; called the Jianguo Pro 3 in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uURBy"&gt;The Pico acquisition seems unlikely to mix with ByteDance’s TikTok service in the near future. It’s also not clear how the acquisition might affect Pico’s rollout plans. The company has so far avoided direct competition with Oculus — which dominates the global VR market but doesn’t operate within China. But with Facebook intensifying its push into VR, Apple reportedly preparing to enter the market, and Sony preparing a follow-up to its PlayStation VR headset, ByteDance is signaling that it’s also interested in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric robotaxis may not be the climate solution we were led to believe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GM Robot Car Company Cruise" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWAwg9JNctrOYzYxtqpiTx8W4yY=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793226/1189070698.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n51fWE"&gt;For years, we’ve been told that electric autonomous taxis can help fight climate change by reducing air pollution. But new research from Harvard Law School suggests these supposedly “zero emissions” vehicles could actually exacerbate many of the problems we are facing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hoNOf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1bd9/pdf"&gt;A new study led by Ashley Nunes&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, concluded that fleets of electric autonomous taxis could “dramatically increase energy consumption and emissions that contribute to climate change — not reduce them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vt6sL"&gt;“While electric vehicles themselves have lower emissions than traditional gasoline-powered ones, our work shows that deploying electric robocabs en masse on America’s streets could actually increase the number of trips, miles driven, and overall emissions,” Nunes said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y5Ly7l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our work shows that deploying electric robocabs en masse on America’s streets could actually increase the number of trips, miles driven, and overall emissions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNNs5M"&gt;Transportation is one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, with the most significant share coming from light-duty vehicles, personal cars, vans, trucks, and SUVs. Replacing some of those trips with electric autonomous vehicles operating as part of a ride-hailing fleet could help offset some of those emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neRL2b"&gt;But by studying data from San Francisco, Nunes’ team found that “ubiquitous electric robocabs might erase those energy savings” by increasing demand for rides while also decreasing ride-pooling or carpooling, largely due to their public perception as easy, cheap, and eco-friendly. In other words, more people would be using these cars to get around who might not have otherwise have done so, thanks to their availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMX9st"&gt;“Our work showed that transportation emissions are likely to rise due to the initiation of car trips that — in the absence of electric robocabs — would not be completed, and an increase in the number of Americans who choose to give up sharing rides in favor of using electric robocabs for single occupant trips,” says Nunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uzqcza"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Transportation emissions are likely to rise due to the initiation of car trips that — in the absence of electric robocabs — would not be completed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OHzEHU"&gt;The study cast doubt on assertions from the AV industry that the advent of electric autonomous vehicles would be a net positive for the environment. Kyle Vogt, co-founder, president, and chief technology officer at Cruise, said as much during an event hosted by the National Federation of the Blind back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWtw1d"&gt;“I know AVs will change the way we live and move: they’ll save lives, improve accessibility, reduce emissions and air pollution, and give people back the most important resources: their time and their freedom to go where they want to go when they want to go,” Vogt said, &lt;a href="https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm19/bm1909/bm190906.htm"&gt;according to the transcript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPxV51"&gt;Cruise often touts its commitment to an all-electric fleet — the company only uses battery-powered Chevy Bolts provided by its financial backer, General Motors — as a key factor that distinguishes it from other AV operators. Most other self-driving car companies use a mix of gas-powered, hybrid, and electric vehicles to comprise their fleets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpxjmU"&gt;The media has also helped push the idea that electric robotaxis would counteract the effects of climate change, with overly speculative headlines like “&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/26/ai-weekly-how-self-driving-cars-could-reduce-emissions-eliminate-parking-spots-and-add-1-3-trillion-to-the-u-s-economy/"&gt;How self-driving cars could reduce emissions, eliminate parking spots, and add $1.3 trillion to the US economy&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/ucdavis/driverless-cars-could-be-a-solution-to-climate-change/"&gt;Driverless cars could be a solution to climate change — but two major things have to happen&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhBNzf"&gt;Some AV operators are aware of the conundrum that could arise from the spread of electric robotaxis. Cruise, for example, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;building a purpose-built autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; designed primarily for shared rides. “It’s designed to be comfortable if it’s shared, but if it’s just you, you’ve got so much space in here you can really like stretch out,” Vogt told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HQQqW"&gt;Promoting shared rides would go a long way toward improving the climate profile of autonomous vehicles in the future, the Harvard team concluded. Rather than handing out tax breaks to people who buy EVs, policymakers should consider financial incentives or discounts for people willing to carpool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4R0wOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Promoting shared rides would go a long way toward improving the climate profile of autonomous vehicles in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amkvnO"&gt;Electric robotaxis would have to be more than “50 percent cleaner than today’s electric cars to reduce emissions, given their anticipated increase in trips,” they said. Cleaning up the electrical grid by eliminating the use of coal and polluting energy sources is another solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czvl5I"&gt;Of course, eliminating the need for car trips altogether by promoting the use of mass transit — or for shorter trips, walking and biking — is the best way to reduce an individual’s overall vehicle miles traveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XuHFS"&gt;Nunes’ study is the latest to poke holes in “zero emissions” claims by the tech and auto industry. A University of Michigan study in 2018 found the shift toward autonomy could &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b04576"&gt;raise (rather than reduce) a vehicle’s energy demands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11116-018-9937-9"&gt;Another research paper&lt;/a&gt; looked at the behavior of households that were offered a free chauffeur service for 60 hours over a seven-day period, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756945/uber-lyft-tnc-vmt-traffic-congestion-study-fehr-peers"&gt;akin to a ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; or a future driverless car. The study participants’ vehicle miles traveled rose by about 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The N64 controller was a weird but essential introduction to joysticks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FoxWXqXMI55fdVqjdaFhU_1XSE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792992/akrales_210716_4639_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BbmTds"&gt;In the annals of gaming history, there’s no controller better known than the three-pronged piece of plastic that shipped with the Nintendo 64. That’s likely for a few reasons. There’s the unique design, which renders it instantly and unmistakably recognizable as the N64’s gamepad. There’s the popularity of the console, which helped cement Nintendo as one of the definitive names in gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRf5yV"&gt;But the most important part of the N64 controller isn’t the design or the box it attached to: it was the joystick, which introduced millions to a new way of controlling games and paved the way for modern 3D gaming that’s virtually standard today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p8VDVp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo didn’t invent the joystick, but it did popularize it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJyqM0"&gt;Nintendo didn’t invent the joystick or the idea of using it for games, but it did popularize the joystick as a default control option for mainstream games in a way that no one else had done before. Prior to the N64, joysticks were limited largely to flight simulator enthusiasts looking for the most realistic platform to mirror actual flight. But the N64 controller offered a joystick as the main control scheme for &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;type of game and placed it front and center in players’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o0LY3fPRuDHHzf8-liaj3K4TaXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756844/akrales_210716_4639_0018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xLV7mn"&gt;One reason for that decision was the shift to 3D gaming, a change Nintendo helped usher in with the N64. Moving around a polygonal three-dimensional world meant players needed the ability to navigate more freely than what a traditional D-pad (designed for grid-like pixels on past consoles) would allow. It’s something reflected in my favorite design cue of the N64 joystick: the octagonal well it rests in, which subtly cues players toward the eight cardinal directions they can tilt the stick and subsequently move their character on-screen. (It’s also a detail Nintendo stuck with on its succeeding consoles up until the Wii U.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ox8Tp"&gt;But the magic of the N64’s controller is how Nintendo used the design to teach players how to use the new joystick and navigate in new planes. The strange-looking third controller grip allowed the N64 controller to be held on the two outside grips like a “regular” controller, but the center-mounted stick encourages players to view it as the primary control scheme. And the textured rubber grip rests naturally under your thumb, making it easy to tilt it in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMhh2X"&gt;The joystick also allowed for more subtle movement than a traditional D-pad. In &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, players are introduced to the idea that they can push the joystick hard to run but tilt it lightly to walk. Later on in the game, they can even use it to fly freely in three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DChOCAHMXuzJkVdz6uXFuDmLuHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756843/akrales_210716_4639_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B8zepK"&gt;The hardware had issues. The mechanism was prone to wearing out and loosening over time, requiring that they be properly maintained, lubricated, and replaced. But it’s important to remember that it was also a first-generation product, released at a time when Nintendo’s biggest competitors, the original PlayStation and Sega Saturn, only had shipped with old-fashioned D-pads. (Both would later release controllers with joysticks after the N64 was released.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGPSDE"&gt;The N64 controller is also very clearly a transition point. Its design looks almost like an SNES controller grew some extra appendages, and the direction pad and face buttons still easily allow for developers and players who were uneasy about the new control scheme to avoid it. There was only the single analog stick, making camera control a frustration in some games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YRP2LF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the PlayStation’s DualShock shaped modern controllers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20978071/playstation-dualshock-controllers-modern-shape-design-ps5-25th-anniversary"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="erL5Ed"&gt;It wouldn’t be until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20978071/playstation-dualshock-controllers-modern-shape-design-ps5-25th-anniversary"&gt;Sony released the Dual Analog Controller in 1997&lt;/a&gt; that the modern double-analog stick design that’s still used on virtually every major controller and gamepad today would arrive. Even Nintendo would go on to offer its own version of PlayStation’s face button / D-pad / dual-stick / triggers layout with the GameCube, the Wii Classic controller, the Wii U, and the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UCWyD"&gt;But the N64’s lone joystick was a starting point, a bridge from the pixelated consoles of the past to the ultra-powerful PlayStations and Xboxes we have today — teaching generations of players a new way to think about gaming and moving in a digital space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tu4SIZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSMdgG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opaYkX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZEFmL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CLLsv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgnMJP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest iPad Air is $100 off at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRyFBqcgLeiVbP_KU8bQ2OhBeK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792757/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TLNUp"&gt;It’s almost unspoken wisdom at this point that you should think twice about buying some costly Apple products in the late summer months, as the company usually announces new stuff during its annual September event. But if you really need or want an iPad with a few pro-level features (but without the high cost of the iPad Pro), this $100 off deal at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748634717956796230" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; on the iPad Air released in 2020 might be what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SztUVq"&gt;Normally $599 for the 64GB version, you can get it now for $499, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet. This model has a 10.9-inch display, and like the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, it charges via USB-C and supports the latest Apple Pencil. Uniquely, it sports a Touch ID sensor within the power button along its side that can unlock the tablet with your fingerprint. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rC38DY"&gt;At Newegg, Gigabyte’s Aero 15 gaming/creator-focused laptop is just $1,249 after a $100 mail-in rebate. It originally sold for $1,799, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F34-233-446" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but today you’ll pay $1,349&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the rebate. For the price, the Aero 15 nets you more impressive specs than many other competing models, including a 15.6-inch 4K OLED screen, an Intel Core i7-11800H processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics chip (maximum graphics power at 105W), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It’s not without a few shortcomings, though, like its less-than-ideal nose cam webcam, the short battery life, and that it can get toasty. This is the KD model, but you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22559671/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read our review of the similar XD version.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5SZRM"&gt;If you buy this laptop, you’ll get complimentary digital copies of &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Humankind&lt;/em&gt;. And, don’t forget to send in the mail-in rebate to get your $100 off.&lt;/p&gt;

These originally sold for $349 when they were released a few years ago, and they’ve only dropped substantially in price because their successor, the similar-looking WH-1000XM4, launched last year. Comparatively, the newer model has some features up on the XM3, including support for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections and a sensor that can automatically play or pause your content when you put them on or take them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHZVII"&gt;This $180 price at Best Buy isn’t the best-ever deal, but it’s close. We once saw them selling from Best Buy for $170 in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yKu56c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DH1bHo"&gt;It’s understandable if $180 might be too costly for an impulse buy. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HMWZBXC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Perhaps Anker’s Soundcore Q30 wireless headphones with active noise cancellation for $60 &lt;/a&gt;might be a better choice for you. Normally $80, these headphones are discounted as part of an Amazon Deal of the Day that expires at the end of the day. I can’t personally vouch for these, but they seem great for the cost, with Anker claiming up to 40 hours of playback per charge in noise cancellation mode, as well as support for two Bluetooth devices simultaneously. They even come folded up in their own zip-up hard case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How police laid down a geofence dragnet for Kenosha protestors</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;ATF investigators used a controversial technique to investigate arson incidents connected to the 2020 police protests&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tirtaZ"&gt;On August 23rd, 2020, police shot Jacob Blake four times in the back in Kenosha, Wisconsin — and within hours, the streets were full of protestors. The National Guard was activated the following morning, and the next week would see &lt;a href="https://abc7chicago.com/kenosha-shooting-protest-looting-fires/6402998/"&gt;as many as 40 buildings destroyed&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two people shot dead by a counter-protestor before order was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZidnm"&gt;But while the events of that week have been closely watched, many of the law enforcement tactics used to respond to those protests are only now coming to light. A series of six newly unsealed warrants (&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051458-kenosha-warrant-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051459-kenosha-warrant-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051460-kenosha-warrant-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051461-kenosha-warrant-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051462-kenosha-warrant-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051463-kenosha-warrant-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/08/26/google-gave-feds-data-on-phones-located-at-kenosha-riot-arsons/?sh=7040672c1dea"&gt;some previously reported by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show a persistent effort to use Google’s location services to identify Android users in the vicinity of arson incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3LUPU"&gt;Issued in quick succession on September 3rd, the warrants came from a team of 50 arson investigators from the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, deployed to Kenosha to prosecute property damage cases connected to the protests. Using the warrants, The agents targeted seven different geographical zones, asking to identify anyone located within that area during a span that could stretch as long as two hours. The result was a kind of location dragnet, spread over some of the busiest times and locations in the first days of the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="hTS5tv"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1-DslUXsAHgihu4uvATP8oh4rdV110Cl4" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94Acpn"&gt;Searching location data for users in a particular area — called a geofence warrant — is a controversial practice that has become widespread in recent years. In one incident in 2020, the data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21169533/florida-google-runkeeper-geofence-police-privacy"&gt;implicated a bicyclist&lt;/a&gt; in the burglary of a home he often rode by. But while the technique is always controversial, it’s particularly alarming when it’s used in conjunction with a mass protest event, inevitably sweeping up innocent civilians alongside suspected arsonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcjT9V"&gt;Jennifer Lynch, who leads the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Street Level Surveillance project, says the fact that police were able to obtain the six warrants with little pushback from the courts shows how dangerous geofence warrants can be. “We know there were hundreds if not thousands of people in the area who were engaged in lawful protest activity,” says Lynch. “It’s unconstitutionally broad. There’s no probable cause alleged in any of the warrants that would support a search encompassing so many people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJGE1H"&gt;Most concerning to privacy advocates, the warrants contain no acknowledgement of the risks of incidental data collection or provisions that would limit the privacy risks of such a request. “When you have an investigation that necessarily involves the collection of information on protests,” says Brett Kaufman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberty Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, “protections need to be in place to both limit collection on the front end and establish the destruction of incidental data afterwards. Otherwise, you’re just giving the government carte blanche.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwwVOA"&gt;The six geofence warrants issued after the Kenosha protests vary widely in their specificity. The most particular request draws on video footage and an eyewitness account of an attempted arson at a TCF Bank just southwest of the city center. That evidence allowed police to narrow the timeframe to a 22-minute period when someone on the north side of the bank broke its windows and hurled in flaming objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSuasSdLLTKoVn9rvtuBSlvirUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814500/Screen_Shot_2021_08_30_at_8.47.51_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The area around the Kenosha public library, as marked by police. Under the terms of &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051459-kenosha-warrant-2" target="_blank"&gt;the warrant&lt;/a&gt;, any users detected in this area between 1AM and 3AM on August 25th would be flagged to investigators.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXRoHq"&gt;Other warrants are far more general. A different warrant looks at a suspected arson of the Kenosha Public Library, based on lighter fluid and rags that were discovered in a northeast window well alongside minimal fire damage. Without direct witnesses to the fire, police set a two-hour window and a geofence covering the middle third of the downtown’s largest public park space. It was a significant span of time on the busiest night of the protest in an area that provided a natural meeting place for anyone who had taken to the streets that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze1LQB"&gt;The near-certainty of incidental collection is particularly alarming for Lynch. “What’s not provided in the warrants is any discussion of how many people were in that geographic area at the time covered by the warrant,” she says. “Those people were not connected to the arsons under investigation and there’s absolutely no reason law enforcement should be able to get access to their location information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLzeVT"&gt;Notably, this isn’t the first time the technique has been used in the wake of a police protest. In May 2020, Minneapolis police &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/"&gt;used a similar technique&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the vandalization of an Autozone store during protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQAhkh"&gt;While many devices collect location data, Google has become a particular target for geofence warrants because of its data retention practices. iOS stores location data in an anonymized and ephemeral way that makes it less accessible to court orders. Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/1/11824118/google-android-location-data-police-warrants"&gt;been reluctant to adopt such a system for Android&lt;/a&gt;, in part because of the data’s value for targeted advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4SbqQ"&gt;The last pages of the warrants show a particular procedure put in place by Google in an effort to address the privacy risks of the system, although much of the process would take place outside of the oversight of the court. Under the system, Google first produces a series of location points, identified with timestamps and unique IDs but no further identifiable information. Once presented with that list, law enforcement “may, at its discretion, identify a subset of the devices,” the warrant reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLg0he"&gt;But while Google’s system could potentially narrow the scope of the warrant, there’s no guidance for how the requests would be narrowed in practice. Most importantly, there’s no mechanism to stop law enforcement from routinely asking to identify every device ID provided, and Google would have no grounds to resist such a request once the warrant has been issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tqkhc"&gt;As a result, critics of geofence warrants see the system as offering little meaningful protection. “It’s a little preposterous to have Google doing its own assessment of what the constitution requires,” says Kaufman. “The rules that govern this kind of data do not come from a private company. They come from the constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eajA3j"&gt;Kaufman sees the problem as particularly urgent given the rapid growth of geofence warrant requests. Google served more than 11,000 geofence warrants in 2020, according to a transparency report &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/google-geofence-warrants/"&gt;released by the company earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority coming from state and local jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfm74w"&gt;“It really is an alarming development that this has expanded so rapidly,” says Kaufman. “The courts need to start paying particular attention to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TT8Pcn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A previous version of this piece said Jacob Blake was shot during a traffic stop. In fact, police were responding to a 911 call. The Verge regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gumroad announces cheaper pricing for creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TmtludlJk-fFue_jM2e1rOog7QI=/0x63:376x314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792527/Gumroad_Logo_Color.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Gumroad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8kFL0z"&gt;Gumroad is announcing &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/pricing"&gt;a new pricing structure today&lt;/a&gt; that streamlines the fees and features of its platform, making it easier for creators to get started selling products or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21572698/gumroad-patreon-like-memberships-support-creators"&gt;memberships online&lt;/a&gt;. Gumroad was one of the early “help people sell things online” businesses, but this change is a sort of reset for the company as the space grows even more crowded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3UBLN"&gt;The first major change is an end to Gumroad’s free and paid “Pro” tiers. Previously, Gumroad locked features like using a custom domain name or offering HD video streams behind a $10 per month subscription. That caused some confusion from users just starting out — did it make sense to commit to paying upfront? Now everyone receives the same features without having to pay extra or worry about overcommitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2TOjwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gumroad is making it a lot easier for anyone to  start selling just about anything online&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qX1zWf"&gt;In exchange, fees start at a higher place — though there’s the potential for sellers to wind up with lower fees overall. Gumroad’s new cut of transactions, whether you’re selling handmade comic books or a membership to an online cooking class, is 9 percent plus 30 cents. That’s higher than the free tier’s earlier fee of 8.5 percent plus 30 cents and the paid tier’s 3.5 percent plus 30 cents. But Gumroad plans to shrink its cut over time as creators hit larger sales milestones, going as low as 2.9 percent plus 30 cents. The various fee percentages breakdown as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lpCbvq"&gt;9 percent fee for earnings between $0 and $1,000 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cBXvhL"&gt;7 percent fee for earnings between $1,00 to $10,000 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vaC0SV"&gt;5 percent fee for earnings between $10,000 to $100,000 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OOUzC4"&gt;3 percent fee for earnings between $100,00 to $1 million &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fNvCjG"&gt;A lifetime 2.9 percent fee for earnings beyond $1 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JWAJfh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://sahillavingia.com/ipo"&gt;Gumroad credits the $5 million it raised&lt;/a&gt; via regulation crowdfunding with its ability to experiment with a more creator-friendly setup. That’s money directly contributed by a mix of normal investors and 2,800 Gumroad users. (If you’re curious about crowdfunding approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Backstage Capital CEO Arlan Hamilton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22213270/arlan-hamilton-backstage-capital-vc-venture-capitalist-interview-decoder"&gt;explained some of its potential on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia called it “a Kickstarter for equity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kyaip"&gt;The added flexibility from that funding, plus a later investment Gumroad raised, means even more features are coming down the road. Gumroad’s next area of focus is introducing the ability for creators to further customize their pages and storefronts, a helpful change for the around 85 percent of creators Lavingia estimates focus on digital products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpjJWh"&gt;The competition Gumroad is potentially facing is only getting more tough, especially now that bigger companies like Twitter and Facebook have their eyes set on creators. Offering more features for an overall lower cost is a good way for Gumroad to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil announces new smartwatches for 2021 that won’t have Wear OS 3 until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fossil Gen 6 watches" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih9HkKecpnYWoYLZHbZ1Yw1kwfc=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792561/FSL4013827_FA21_AD_09_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil Gen 6 watches | Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kSfGK"&gt;Fossil has announced its fall 2021 smartwatch lineup running Wear OS, which it is calling the Gen 6 Touchscreen. As with the Gen 5 Fossil watches, the Gen 6 will come in a few different styles and sizes and there will also be versions sold under the Michael Kors brand. Prices will start at $299 and they’ll be available for preorder immediately. It does not appear that Fossil will offer LTE options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BzDRh"&gt;Unfortunately, these watches will be shipping with the current Wear OS 2 software and not the new Wear OS 3 that runs on t&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;he latest Samsung Galaxy Watches&lt;/a&gt;. Fossil says that it’s going to offer upgrades to Wear OS 3 for Gen 6 watches in 2022, though exactly &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; in 2022 is a trickier question. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;Google has said&lt;/a&gt; that Wear OS 2 watches wouldn’t have updates available until “late 2022” and that even then those updates would require a hard reset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPoDrO"&gt;Although Fossil’s Gen 6 watches won’t have the most up-to-date software for some time, the company is still making a solid go of packing more technology in than before. Fossil is adding an SpO2 sensor and claims it has an “upgraded heart rate sensor” with “improved signal accuracy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yo2f2J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Gen 6 models will come in either a 42mm or 44mm case size&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xuu80O"&gt;Fossil also says the Gen 6 will be the first watch to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ processor. The “+” part of that 4100 is supposed to equate to faster speeds, “more efficient power consumption,” and also faster charging. All three of those have historically been fairly bad on Wear OS devices, but especially the first two. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Fossil’s own Gen 5 watches from 2019&lt;/a&gt; (which used the regular Snapdragon 4100) were pokey and required an entire subsystem of confusing battery preferences to get through a normal day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eT3sO0"&gt;One small advantage Fossil may have over Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch is that the Gen 6 will use the Google Assistant and Google Pay instead of Samsung’s Bixby and Samsung Pay. For Samsung users, the Galaxy Watch 4 is likely to be a better fit, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JecjE"&gt;There are not many Wear OS manufacturers left to compete with, so for Android users looking for a full-featured watch the pickings are slim. Aside from Samsung’s option, there’s little else beyond Fossil and Mobvoi’s TicWatch line — almost all the other manufacturers have either given up or switched to lightweight, in-house software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6ZU1V"&gt;All of which could work in Fossil’s favor. If Fossil’s Gen 6 watches can at least rise to an acceptable level of speed and battery life, they may be a viable option for Android users. Google is backporting some of its improved Wear OS apps to the current platform, too, which could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dJdZ9"&gt;Even though Fossil’s news today is focused on the improved specs, speeds and feeds have never been the main selling point for its smartwatches. Instead, it primarily aims to make something that people would be happy to wear. You can take a look at a small gallery of the different Gen 6 models Fossil is releasing below.&lt;/p&gt;

The change is being made in response to growing concern over gaming addiction and a broader crackdown on China’s tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECbtmw"&gt;Children under the age of 18 will now be restricted to one hour of gaming from 8pm to 9pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; and on public holidays. That’s a change from the previous limit of 1.5 hours of online gameplay on most days. Gaming companies must restrict online game play outside those hours, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-rolls-out-new-rules-minors-online-gaming-xinhua-2021-08-30/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and must have a real name verification system in place to ensure the new rules are enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A9tapa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;State intervention was inevitable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gAwxBq"&gt;Regulators say they’ll also work with parents and schools to help combat gaming addiction amongst Chinese youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ogx6jc"&gt;The new rules issued today come a month after an article published by state media described online games as “spiritual opium.” Although the phrase was later removed, the tone of the article, especially in hindsight, left little doubt that state intervention was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first Neon Genesis Evangelion Blu-rays you can actually buy ship November 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DNCg8bQJHd4PNxBDDCRgmc42Bc=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792184/eva_blu_ray_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kTk12m"&gt;You might have heard that &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;, the seminal 1995 anime series seemingly about giant mech battles but &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; deeper and more disturbing than that,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is coming to Blu-ray for the very first time in the US, UK, and beyond. What you might not have heard: when that news was first announced nearly two weeks ago, it was just for a $275 limited-edition &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22632212/neon-genesis-evangelion-blu-ray-release-date-price-ultimate-editiona"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultimate Edition&lt;/a&gt; whose stateside release of just 5,000 copies sold out in the blink of an eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP36J4"&gt;Today, GKids is rectifying that with a five-disc Standard Edition that costs just $60 and will actually ship a month earlier than those $275 copies, technically making it the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; first official Blu-ray release in the United States when it arrives November 9th. And if you’re still bummed you couldn’t get the 11-disc Ultimate Edition? Well, there’s also a new 11-disc Collectors Edition for $220 that you might like instead, shipping December 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AKHJS"&gt;Both are &lt;a href="https://store.gkids.com/"&gt;available for preorder today&lt;/a&gt;, and should feature the same 1080p remastered footage (with a 1:33:1 aspect ratio) and with DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio for both English and Japanese. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBeTuI"&gt;Each edition contains the full original 26-episode series, as well as &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: Death (True)&lt;/em&gt;² — which older fans might know as &lt;em&gt;Death &amp;amp; Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; — and &lt;em&gt;The End of Evangelion, &lt;/em&gt;as well as bonus features including “animatics, TV commercials, music videos and more.” The Collector’s Edition also comes with a full set of additional discs containing the original classic English dub of the entire series, two extra hours of bonus features including the Japanese cast auditions, plus a 40-page book and 8 art cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEFjdJ"&gt;The Collector’s Edition looks a little something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1uC-f_FrTFk0myFaJz1WKcKOMK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814334/NeoGenEvaTCSCE_BR_BeautyShots_6_Web.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HkUkha"&gt;That’s not quite as lavish as the Ultimate Edition, of course, whose included book is nearly quadruple the size at 156-pages and comes with fancier art and a NERV ID badge, but I think I’ll live. (&lt;a href="https://evangelion.alltheanime.com/"&gt;The UK version of that&lt;/a&gt; isn’t actually sold out as of this writing, in case you’re interested.) Here’s the Ultimate Edition’s spread:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dl5LyVz1b5Epjg1-6hXzcpsKTg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814335/NGE_US_PackShot_Box_Front_Approved.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RMVp0I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evangelion &lt;/em&gt;was one of the first shows that introduced me to anime, and some of its more disturbing moments still live in my head rent-free. When the series and its follow-up films finally legally arrived in the US again via Netflix (where you can still watch them today), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/22/18701441/neon-genesis-evangelion-hedgehogs-dilemma-shinji"&gt;we called them “the perfect story for this moment in history.”&lt;/a&gt; And that was before the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDSzMr"&gt;The UK and Australia will likely be announcing similar editions today: &lt;a href="https://evangelion.alltheanime.com/"&gt;here’s the UK distributor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.madman.com.au/actions/channel.do"&gt;click here for Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse embraces spatial audio for more lifelike conversations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rd__2oO0onevj913JZnY7CllLAQ=/0x155:1024x838/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792065/Leah_Full.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leah Lamarr is currently featured as the Clubhouse icon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjif2O"&gt;Clubhouse began rolling out a iOS app update on Sunday that enables &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/spatial-audio-clubhouse/"&gt;spatial audio support&lt;/a&gt;. The Android update is “coming soon,” according to the company. The feature works by introducing subtle spatial cues that position speakers on Clubhouse calls into three-dimensional space around your head, making the remote listening experience a better approximation of being in a room full of people. It works best with headphones, either Bluetooth or wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkE178"&gt;Clubhouse tweeted out a video allowing you to hear for yourself how it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BB2ytc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hear ye, hear ye   spAAaAaAatial audio on Clubhouse!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's like surround sound, but w/ your own headphones. A more vibrant, human experience! Plus makes it much easier to tell who's talking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juberti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@juberti&lt;/a&gt; for this one    rolling out now on iOS, Android coming soon! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zit6F9ijRK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zit6F9ijRK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1432014506247417860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9YCUeg"&gt;Clubhouse’s implementation of spatial audio first assigns a specific position to each speaker and then evenly distributes them around a room. It then applies HRTFs, or head related transfer functions, similar to what we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fresearch%2Fproject%2Fspatial-audio%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;used by Microsoft in the HoloLens&lt;/a&gt; to make it seem like you’re in the center of a conversation. Clubhouse’s implementation doesn’t include head tracking like Apple’s, which makes audio from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631444/netflix-spatial-audio-support-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and Apple TV Plus shows seem like it’s coming from your playback device as you move your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2G0qS"&gt;Spatial audio is having a moment in 2021 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple embraced it&lt;/a&gt; across the company’s product lines. Sony added 3D audio to the PS5, and followed the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Amazon Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; with its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;object-based 360-degree speaker&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567035/verizon-spatial-audio-adaptive-sound-motorola"&gt;Even Verizon is getting in on the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
