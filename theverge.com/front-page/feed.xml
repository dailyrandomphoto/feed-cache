    <title>Secretly throttling is never okay</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oqj0MakQBtEkdeVeOgoGtaFWenI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572807/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBrVTC"&gt;Last Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; caught OnePlus doing the previously unthinkable — throttling the performance of its new flagship smartphone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing “inexplicable” slowdown, &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16794/oneplus-9-performance-examination/"&gt;the publication discovered&lt;/a&gt; the phone was diverting a laundry list of popular apps &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from its Snapdragon 888’s high-performance cores. The company’s excuse? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568107/oneplus-9-pro-battery-life-app-throttling-benchmarks"&gt;It was all an attempt to save battery life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORRG0g"&gt;Today, OnePlus is doubling down on that earlier statement &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/insight-into-oneplus-9-series-processor-and-app-optimization.1467338/"&gt;with a longer forum post&lt;/a&gt;, where the company’s argument sounds downright reasonable. “In recent years, the performance of smartphone SoCs has reached a point where their power is often overkill in certain scenarios,” writes OnePlus, blaming Qualcomm for essentially being &lt;em&gt;too good at its job&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuAIgh"&gt;“With this in mind, our team has shifted its attention from simply providing sheer performance to providing the performance you expect from our devices while reducing power consumption and heat dissipation,” adds OnePlus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNk5S7"&gt;That sounds good! Now, here are three problems with that seemingly cogent argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PMaSz"&gt;First, OnePlus has sold devices based on raw speed for years now, and despite the OnePlus 9 Pro’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22340406/oneplus-9-phone-price-release-date-availability"&gt;Hasselblad-branded cameras&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no exception. The company’s entire tagline is “Never Settle,” and the company promised a “flawlessly ‘Fast and Smooth’ experience” from the OnePlus 9 Pro. “You’ll be one step ahead of the curve,” the company assured users during its launch presentation, calling the phone’s Snapdragon 888 “the best there is of all the dragons in the kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IC6-rrkCrnPY-qasvzsjznDRshQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713252/oneplus_888.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro promises “ultimate performance” from its new Snapdragon chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ktjxPR"&gt;Second, if &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; is right, you do appear to be settling here. The publication found the phone less responsive than a Galaxy S21 Ultra in side by side tests, despite having worse battery life, even though both use the same chips and same screen technology. The slowdown “applies to pretty much everything that has any level of popularity in the Play Store,” too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhN03b"&gt;Third and most importantly, OnePlus &lt;em&gt;didn’t tell anyone. &lt;/em&gt;And now, the company’s trying to make it sound like the practice of secretly throttling a device could somehow ever be okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meuPOl"&gt;This is a dangerous idea. If we establish that a phonemaker can quietly throttle on a user’s behalf, what’s to keep them from doing that whenever they like? For years, conspiracy theories have swirled about how gadget makers slow down or otherwise cripple devices to force their users to upgrade, and many of them were dismissed as just that — conspiracy theories — until it was revealed that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;actually did something of the sort&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUVfRp"&gt;Back then, Apple also had a good excuse about how its throttling was saving your phone’s battery, but it didn’t change the fact that the company hid it from users, causing an unknown number of them to upgrade their phones earlier than they might have needed to. The company settled twice (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161271/apple-settlement-500-million-throttling-batterygate-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;once for $500 million&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573710/apple-battery-gate-throttle-iphones-settlement-amount"&gt;once for $113 million&lt;/a&gt;) and added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16984234/how-to-iphone-throttling-ios-11-3"&gt;turn off throttling&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple still largely normalized the idea that its actions were okay, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/31/18047174/iphone-x-8-plus-performance-throttling-battery-management-ios-12-1-update"&gt;brought the controversial processor throttling feature to later phones&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p1zFV"&gt;When OnePlus realized that it wanted to shift its focus away from “simply providing sheer performance,” the time to tell us would have been on stage, before people purchased the phone, and it should have been packaged as a feature that you can turn on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo1rHt"&gt;That’s the kind of relationship the company’s power-user fans expect to have with OnePlus. That’s the brand OnePlus built. Now, it’s at risk of erosion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWjTA5"&gt;Let’s not pretend this is normal or acceptable for OnePlus, or any other manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy Z Fold 3 will support the S Pen Pro, according to FCC filings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NBcIorRIvoOCJq93AWxdQ-MK6HE=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572527/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_11.56.01_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s S Pen and S Pen Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dj1Cqq"&gt;After many teases, it seems as if a Samsung foldable is finally going to get support for an S Pen stylus. &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;amp;application_id=PQFsmd5Fd6mroqLRXdITpA%3D%3D&amp;amp;fcc_id=A3LEJP5450"&gt;FCC filings for the S Pen Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a bigger version of the S Pen with Bluetooth connectivity that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;Samsung announced in January&lt;/a&gt;, have been made public, and &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5331981"&gt;one document (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the upcoming stylus will work with the unannounced Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which is presumably the next device in the Z Fold lineup). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfEzjv"&gt;And it’s not just the Z Fold 3 — the stylus, which doesn’t have a release date but is set to hit this year, will apparently support the S21 Ultra, the Note 20 lineup, and more. You can see the full list of devices that the S Pen Pro will support in this image from the filing:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ou0zA8U1fDyJWAS7ubIY3cv4br4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22713180/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_12.09.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5331981" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The list of devices the S Pen Pro will support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8fgNuC"&gt;The S Pen Pro’s support for the Z Fold 3 isn’t a major surprise — the company has been hinting toward some sort of S Pen support for the foldable for some time. During last year’s Unpacked event, Samsung’s president of mobile TM Roh said in a Q&amp;amp;A that the company has been “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231677/samsung-s-pen-foldable-support-additional-device-categories"&gt;happy to hear&lt;/a&gt;” that people want the S Pen to work with the Fold. In a December blog, he said that the company was looking to bring some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;to other devices&lt;/a&gt; — which seems likely to be a wink toward stylus support, one of the hallmarks of the Note line. And in January, Roh was even more explicit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231677/samsung-s-pen-foldable-support-additional-device-categories"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; the company plans to “expand the S Pen experience across additional device categories in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiKSNl"&gt;A detailed leak has already shown the unannounced phone with a stylus: a render shared by noted leaker Evan Blass depicts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;what appears to be the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; with a new “Fold Edition” S Pen propped up next to it. Perhaps the Z Fold 3 will come with the Fold Edition stylus in the box while the S Pen Pro will be sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxbKF5"&gt;FCC documents becoming public can indicate that a product may be announced soon after they are published. In this case, an official announcement for the S Pen sometime soon would make sense, as Samsung has held summer Unpacked events in early August for the past few years. Blass has also already stated that this year’s event is scheduled for August 11th, alongside revealing a bunch of other devices that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;expected to be revealed at the show&lt;/a&gt;, including the Z Fold 3, the Z Flip 3, two new Galaxy Watches, and new Galaxy Buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pbj0l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for the tip, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/smartvenkat95/status/1414632885521321986"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Venkatesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black players on England football team bombarded with racist abuse on social media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Italy v England - UEFA Euro 2020: Final" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dynojAm9NaePPl3p34j-l9iTeZ0=/126x0:3965x2559/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572407/1328326456.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vfqd8X"&gt;Social media platforms have been inundated with racist messages and posts directed at three Black players on England’s football team, following a tough loss to Italy on Sunday in the UEFA Euro 2020 championship match. The two teams played to a 1-1 tie, and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka were among England’s players to participate in a penalty shootout to decide the winner of the match and the tournament. All three missed their shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKeD5w"&gt;After the game ended, the players’ social media accounts, including Facebook-owned Instagram and Twitter, were filled with racist comments and messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAeZnC"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday, a Twitter spokesperson said the “abhorrent, racist abuse directed at England players” had no place on the platform. Since the end of Sunday’s game, Twitter removed more than 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended a number of accounts — the spokesperson did not say how many — for violating its rules &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior"&gt;against harassment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy"&gt;hateful content&lt;/a&gt;. “We have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our partners across the football community to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour — both online and offline,” the spokesperson said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ri1xVL"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said the company didn’t have numbers to share, but said the platform “quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England’s footballers last night and we’ll continue to take action against those that break our rules.” The spokesperson added that the company had encouraged all players to turn on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;Instagram’s hidden words tool&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents abuse or comments from being visible in direct messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xt6dM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dbkzk/marcus-rashford-jadon-sancho-bukayo-saka-suffer-racist-abuse-and-death-threats-after-england-euro-2020-final-defeat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported that even more extreme abuse&lt;/a&gt;, including threats against the players, was turning up on white supremacist channels on Telegram, which has much looser moderation policies than Twitter or Facebook. Telegram didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OT5jVD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Social media companies “need to step up and take accountability,” the Football Association said&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XRYi2N"&gt;England’s Football Association &lt;a href="https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/jul/12/20210712-statement-online-abuse-of-england-players#main-content"&gt;said in a statement Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it was “appalled by the online racism that has been aimed at some of our England players on social media.” Anyone behind the “disgusting” behavior is not welcome as a fan, the FA said, adding it was supporting the players “while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hL10NH"&gt;The FA statement added that social media companies “need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making the platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0zffm"&gt;England’s players were &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/13/england-players-take-knee-wembley-euro-2020-boos-applause"&gt;frequently booed by fans at Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; during the tournament when the players kneeled on the field before matches as an anti-racism gesture. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/italy-wins-european-soccer-championship-3-2-penalty-shootout-n1273643"&gt;Both teams kneeled&lt;/a&gt; before the start of Sunday’s match, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Q5Yni"&gt;UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was criticized for previously &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/07/boris-johnson-refuses-to-condemn-fans-booing-england-taking-the-knee"&gt;failing to defend the players&lt;/a&gt; who kneeled before games, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1414465103374729220?"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Monday that the players “deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dqm9vi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SB Nation: The racism aimed at Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho, and Marcus Rashford was not a surprise","url":"https://theshortfuse.sbnation.com/2021/7/12/22574036/bukayo-saka-marcus-rashford-jadon-sancho-england-racism-euro-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T removes high-speed data throttling from its most expensive unlimited plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqLROxVNJSTHin7-Ar9XuTBo30Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572265/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite plan will remain $85 per month for a single line, but it gets a few more perks.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2tf3k"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is adding a few more benefits to its $85-per-month top-tier unlimited plan at no added cost. Unlimited Elite subscribers will now truly have access to unlimited high-speed data and will no longer be subject to deprioritization after hitting 100GB of data per month. Customers will also get a bump from 30GB of monthly hotspot data up to 40GB as well as up to 4K video streaming — boosted from a maximum of 1080p. The new plan features will be added automatically for all current subscribers starting this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u12QBY"&gt;If this all sounds familiar, that’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;T-Mobile did more or less the same thing earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Elite now matches T-Mobile’s Magenta Max nearly feature-by-feature. Both start at $85 per line (including autopay discounts) and include the same 40GB hotspot data, 4K streaming, and (actually) unlimited high-speed data plan features. AT&amp;amp;T includes HBO Max on its plan whereas T-Mobile offers Netflix, but otherwise, they’re broadly similar. The “Un-carrier” T-Mobile is looking an awful lot like a regular carrier these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abmx0D"&gt;Most unlimited phone plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360228/unlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits"&gt;include data deprioritization in the fine print&lt;/a&gt;, meaning after a certain threshold of monthly data is reached, your account is subject to slowdowns when the network is busy. In this case, T-Mobile’s move to do away with this practice for its highest-paying customers appears to have put pressure on its competitors to do the same. There’s just the slight issue of providing high-speed 5G data that’s worth getting excited about, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has struggled to do&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of years, but things will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;likely improve in the near future&lt;/a&gt;. Until then, it’s your move, Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thiel associate launches Arizona Senate campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OlzP7nhZB7grK6K78foo2Oniyk=/200x0:1721x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572206/Screen_Shot_2021_07_12_at_3.02.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sdjIZw"&gt;Blake Masters, a close ally to billionaire Peter Thiel and current Thiel Capital executive, launched a bid for the Arizona Senate Monday. As a Republican, he’ll be seeking to take on Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ). Masters joins a growing pool of Republican candidates, including Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and solar power executive Jim Lamon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zKOPt"&gt;On his campaign website, Masters champions a total ban on illegal immigration, calling for the government to use “physical walls, surveillance technology, thousands more border patrol agents, and mandatory E-Verify for employers” along the US-Mexico border. Thiel’s Founder’s Fund invested in the border and military surveillance company Anduril, valuing the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-01/anduril-startup-backed-by-peter-thiel-is-valued-at-1-9-billion?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;at $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqoqk1"&gt;Masters’ website also vows to “take on the ‘big tech’ platforms — the new public square where free speech is constantly under attack.” However, no clear policy solutions are listed on the site.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Arizona is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/tucson-native-blake-masters-enters-senate-race"&gt;become a key battleground state&lt;/a&gt; for both Republicans and Democrats in the 2022 midterms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6T8Jer"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Masters’ website also vows to “take on the ‘big tech’ platforms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8NY56"&gt;A 34-year-old Tucson resident, Masters rose to prominence by co-authoring &lt;em&gt;Zero to One&lt;/em&gt; alongside Thiel in 2014 and serving as an executive in a number of Thiel’s companies. In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403518/peter-thiel-pac-arizona-senate-donation-mark-kelly"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reported that Thiel created&lt;/a&gt; the new Saving Arizona PAC in support of Masters’ anticipated Senate run, donating $10 million to fund the PAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyQE1x"&gt;Thiel has emerged as one of the biggest donors leading up to the 2022 midterm election cycle. In March, Thiel donated $10 million in support of &lt;em&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/em&gt; author J.D. Vance’s campaign for Ohio Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niTH6E"&gt;Since 2016, Thiel has supported a number of Republican political candidates, including former President Donald Trump. Thiel has been a longtime critic of Democrats and has donated thousands in support of Republican politicians like former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Missouri’s Sen. Josh Hawley. Thiel was one of the earliest investors in Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk has a ticket to ride on Richard Branson’s spaceplane</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y5mHkTHBLusEajRAE41cd-6Nydw=/0x0:743x495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572198/E6A_2GfVEAESZrr.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Richard Branson and a barefoot Elon Musk hang out on the morning of Branson’s launch to space. | Richard Branson’s Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HIiABT"&gt;Space billionaire Elon Musk bought a ticket to space from fellow space billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-has-a-ticket-to-space-too-with-richard-bransons-virgin-11626012705"&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; a company spokesperson as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rBQsM"&gt;Musk, CEO and founder of SpaceX, had the Virgin Galactic ticket before Branson’s flight to space on Sunday, a person familiar with the purchase tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s unclear where Musk stands in Virgin Galactic’s line of about 600 other prospective SpaceShipTwo passengers, but the ticket itself is an extension of his apparent friendship with Branson that contrasts with all of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570287/space-tourism-virgin-galactic-branson-blue-origin-bezos"&gt;sass and pettiness&lt;/a&gt; this month from Blue Origin, the other top space company founded by the space industry’s other super-rich billionaire, Jeff Bezos. It’s also seen as a friendly endorsement of Virgin Galactic’s rocket-powered plane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDeb97"&gt;Branson flew to space on Sunday aboard his company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane in a ridiculously extravagant test flight that featured elaborately produced video segments, a concert, and celebrity appearances from Stephen Colbert and astronaut Chris Hadfield. After a successful midair launch, Branson and three other Virgin Galactic employees briefly floated around the spaceplane’s cabin in microgravity before heading back toward the ground a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sGgRh4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Billionaire space pals&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n8p5VK"&gt;Musk’s SpaceX has been mostly focused on government contracts to ferry astronauts and cargo into space, but it has its first private astronaut mission teed up for September. That mission will be a longer (and far more expensive) trip into orbit, not just a few minutes above the edge of Earth’s atmosphere like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euxV6j"&gt;Musk and Branson are good pals. The Tesla CEO watched Branson’s takeoff in person from Spaceport America on Sunday. “Thanks for being so typically supportive and such a good friend, Elon,” Branson tweeted before the flight. Branson spent his pre-dawn morning before liftoff with Musk. “Great to start the morning with a friend,” he said in another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485?s=20"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Feeling good, feeling excited, feeling ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LtXvOy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks for being so typically supportive and such a good friend, Elon. Great to be opening up space for all - safe travels and see you at Spaceport America! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unity22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unity22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@virgingalactic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fLCoeJOPJJ"&gt;https://t.co/fLCoeJOPJJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Richard Branson (@richardbranson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1413886033330982915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j5MXrQ"&gt;SpaceShipTwo is the rocket-plane that stands at the center of Virgin Galactic’s nascent space tourism business. Each ticket for one of the plane’s six seats sells for roughly $250K, and the company has booked over 600 passengers so far, including celebrities like Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Bezos’ Blue Origin is most competitive with Virgin for a slice of the space tourism pie, aiming to launch customers to a slightly higher altitude on a totally different system: the suborbital New Shepard rocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eilazM"&gt;Bezos’ own show-and-tell with New Shepard is scheduled for July 20th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Formula E nearly turned a profit during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6aRPV6FM3EGEY78P9SKciex2yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69572160/formula_e_7045.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a7si2l"&gt;All-electric racing series Formula E very nearly turned its first profit during the 2019–2020 season, its sixth, despite canceling nine of the 14 races originally scheduled in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Six of those races were eventually made up at a single track in Berlin, Germany, which — along with other internal changes — ultimately helped bring the series’s total costs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKQD9b"&gt;All told, Formula E lost just €38,514 before taxes during its sixth season, down from a €10.6 million &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21257563/formula-e-loss-revenue-season-five-attendance"&gt;loss in season five&lt;/a&gt; (about $45,700 and $11.6 million, respectively), according to a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712991/formula_e_operations_limited_season_six.pdf"&gt;new filing&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08412477/filing-history"&gt;UK’s Companies House Registry&lt;/a&gt;. That’s despite the series bringing in less money — revenue dropped to €143 million down from €161.5 million in season five ($169.6 million and $177.6 million, respectively), thanks to lost ticket sales and other moneymaking sponsorship agreements tied to the canceled races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxVfzd"&gt;It was the first time ever that Formula E generated less revenue than in the prior season — in fact, through season four, the series had nearly doubled the amount of revenue it generated each year, as it locked down bigger deals with race sponsors and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20960013/uber-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-lucid-motors-virgin-hyperloop-formula-e-dara-khosrowshahi"&gt;host countries like Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. But while the pandemic caused millions of people around the world to lose their jobs, Formula E actually increased the number of people it employed during season six to 97, up from 89 in season five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YIEo97"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-5MNNf" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/5MNNf/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="400" data-iframe-fallback-alt="(In millions of Euros)" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5MNNf/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="400" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Formula E revenues and losses" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-5MNNf");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-5MNNf");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="njj5um"&gt;It’s a remarkable testament to the success of the young series, which was widely teased when it launched in 2014 but now features more manufacturers than any other motorsport in the world. Automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Nissan, and Jaguar have flocked to the series because of its relative low cost (especially when compared to something like Formula One) and because it’s an attractive way to promote their electrification efforts. In fact, despite BMW and Audi announcing that they will leave Formula E at the end of the seventh season, Formula E will still feature more automakers than other racing series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7No0Zw"&gt;Formula E said in the filing that it expects to be able to generate increasing amounts of revenue now that it has protocols in place to deal with the pandemic and is back to putting on races in front of fans. (The series just put on two races in New York City this past weekend, and is slated to wrap up season seven in August.) Though, if it struggles to do that, the series has built out a bit more of a safety net. According to the filing, Formula E dramatically increased its cash buffer in season six, ending the 2020 fiscal year with nearly €83 million in the bank, up from just €8.3 million in season five ($98.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax4vSk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use a TikTok video template</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ofKmjHvNtJi45jo1x35-ReMsyxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571941/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0eGeIz"&gt;You can create a great TikTok video by doing nothing more than simply talking to the camera. However, if you want to do something a little fancier or you’re still unsure of your own ability to spruce up your video, you can start with some of the pre-designed templates that come with the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQ6x4l"&gt;Templates make it easy to create a lively, complex video — you just have to drop your own photos and / or videos into the template, and you’re done. (You can, of course, add your own text, sounds, effects, etc. as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7EBR7"&gt;Here’s how to start using a template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MD4uvw"&gt;Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen to start a new video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VLNvDe"&gt;Select “Templates.” (You’ll find it next to the “Camera” label at the bottom of the screen.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AftiDiFU2s47DYxkATKv3djm27g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712905/Screenshot_20210712_100040.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the “Templates” link at bottom right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRR9sFGdfhCJy2y7bIAC3asALTE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712907/Screenshot_20210712_100251.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the “Templates” link at bottom right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ERfQ6Q"&gt;Swipe through the prepared templates that came with the app. Last I checked, I had 11, but the number can vary. Each template will have a descriptive name, and under that, it will tell you how many photos you can use with the template. Some will have a minimum and a maximum (say, two to five photos), while others will simply have a maximum (up to, say, five photos). If you see one you like, tap the large “Select photos” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OvAWL1"&gt;You’ll be taken to your device’s photos area. Don’t worry that you’ll forget how many photos you can use; you’ll find the number in the lower left of your screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Each template can use a certain number of photos." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfMNafs5TTolj305S6SEjhRtBBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712911/Screenshot_20210712_132903.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each template can use a certain number of photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the photos that you want to include." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P4Ey88CGaR0gv3Dr14QvcrXvbVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712913/Screenshot_20210712_101230.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the photos that you want to include.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wd4Zap"&gt;As soon as TikTok has finished processing the photos, they will be dropped into the template&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CTWvmI"&gt;From here, you can make some additional changes. For example, you can add stickers, tweak the effects, or add a voiceover. The rest of the process of saving and posting a TikTok video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567211/tiktok-video-how-to-beginners"&gt;is the same as always&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It may take a few seconds to process the images." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-59_cNIu1U4MeRAlG_j2v-qqdeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712917/Screenshot_20210712_101306.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It may take a few seconds to process the images.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once your photos incorporated into the template, you can continue to tweak the video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Asxk9nDb5A5zsPw5mlfQ6lZ2eFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712918/Screenshot_20210712_101448.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once your photo’s incorporated into the template, you can continue to tweak the video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JnSowv"&gt;But what if you don’t like any of the templates that TikTok has supplied? There are a variety of free templates and tools out there offered by a plethora of companies and creators such as Zoomerang and Canva. But be wary: while these and other services may offer free templates, you may have to deal with watermarks, ads, or other add-ons that you might rather avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="tM42vx"&gt;Amazon is interested in using radar sensors to enable sleep tracking and gestures on its smart devices, according to &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/070974410095/DA-21-813A1.pdf"&gt;new permissions&lt;/a&gt; granted by the Federal Communications Commission (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/technology?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The implementation might be similar to how Google uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;its Soli sensor in the second-generation Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="108ZEE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10622234731686/20210622%20Amazon%20Rule%2015.255(c)(3)%20Waiver%20Request.pdf"&gt;Amazon’s initial request&lt;/a&gt; to the FCC filed on June 22nd (and &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/amazon-eyes-soli-style-radar-sensors-for-sleep-tracking-and-smart-home-12682096/"&gt;dug up by &lt;em&gt;SlashGear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) claims that its planned use of radar would enable “touchless control of device features and functions without causing harmful interference to co-frequency users,” which could be helpful to users with limited mobility or speech impairments. The company also says that the new sensors can be used for “sleep tracking and could help improve consumers’ awareness and management of sleep hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CteslQ"&gt;Rumors first appeared that Amazon was building a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216648/amazon-sleep-tracking-alexa-brahms-apnea-radar-device"&gt;“palm-sized” Alexa-enabled sleep tracker&lt;/a&gt; in January, with a specific focus on tracking breathing for users who have sleep apnea. The company also already digests and displays sleep data for anyone who uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;its Halo band&lt;/a&gt; (the one with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-study"&gt;the accurate but problematic body scanning feature&lt;/a&gt;). Amazon’s been expanding on the Halo app’s capabilities with a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465737/amazon-halo-fitness-phone-camera-measure-movement-health"&gt;Movement Health feature&lt;/a&gt; analyzing flexibility that was released last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VyZUe"&gt;Amazon’s request doesn’t spell out what an actual product with these new radar sensors might look like, but adding them to future Echo devices doesn’t seem like much of a reach, given how comfortably they fit on bedside tables. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;In its Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s Soli radar sensors track sleep movements and breath in concert with microphones and an onboard temperature sensor. Buying in means allowing Google, and maybe one day Amazon, to stare at you all night but in a way that’s less invasive than a camera feed or wristband.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SecretLab’s Titan Evo chair claims to offer more comfort, features, and magnets</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvL4d2"&gt;SecretLab’s new line of 2022 gaming chairs have a renewed focus on packing in more features without significantly boosting the price. It’s also making it easier to decide which one to buy. Instead of offering both the Titan and Omega chairs, it’s cramming the best aspects of each into a single model called the Titan Evo. SecretLab told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll  launch the Titan Evo in mid-July starting at about $20 or $30 more than the small-sized Omega chair, which is currently selling for $359.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldoC1b"&gt;The company is offering the Titan Evo in small, regular, and extra-large sizes. And no matter the size you choose, it’ll come with the same new comfort and cosmetic features. It revamped the seat base to offer thigh support, and there’s a new knob on the left side of the chair that tweaks its new and improved “L-ADAPT” lumbar support system. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be able to detach and magnetically attach different arm rests that you purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tq6lqK"&gt;Following SecretLab’s recent obsession with magnets in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405816/secretlab-first-pc-desk-magnus-metal-magnets-cable-management"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; desk, the Titan Evo has replaceable magnetic arm rests. You’ll be able to upgrade with more materials in the future, including Technogel. There are more magnets! The pillow that comes with each Titan Evo chair attaches to the chair magnetically. SecretLab emphasized that it was challenging to develop strong magnets in a pillow that didn’t impact its softness, or put wear on the chair over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc9VEF"&gt;The company is offering the Titan Evo in two new colors available with its hybrid polyurethane (PU) leatherette material: royal and ash, which are a blue and gray color, respectively. SecretLab says it has improved that material, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401434/secretlab-omega-titan-softweave-black-fabric-gaming-chair"&gt;its SoftWeave weaving technique&lt;/a&gt;, to be more durable. It claims that its PU leatherette is 12 times more durable than standard PU leatherette. Also, it uses a new weaving technique to bring color gradients to what SecretLab is calling SoftWeave Plus fabric, which it claims has a 3.5x improvement in strength.&lt;/p&gt;
