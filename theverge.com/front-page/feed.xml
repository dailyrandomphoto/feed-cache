    <title>Microsoft Edge’s new Kids Mode is ideal for shared family PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Edge Kids Mode" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZCDSI84GG8SA4tuD81zp1cFiqc=/80x0:958x585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131123/KM_news_feed.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NEXWTJ"&gt;Microsoft is launching a new Kids Mode for its Edge browser today. It’s built directly into Microsoft Edge on Windows and macOS as a free option that’s simple to enable and doesn’t require much work for parents to manage. The mode can be enabled by selecting it from the Edge profile option, and it will lock kids into the Edge browser with access only to approved sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HwJh4"&gt;“It’s a free, protected online environment for kids 12 and under that gives parents peace of mind when their kids browse the web on a shared device,” explains Divya Kumar, product director of Microsoft Edge, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeTCvOuBM_6fk6JhamLQpIMinJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445703/accessing_Kids_Mode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids Mode in Microsoft Edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rFYCHz"&gt;Microsoft really designed this Kids Mode around the scenario where parents might hand a laptop over to a child to let them browse the web. Once you trigger Kids Mode, there’s an option to select between five to eight years or nine to 12 years. Both age ranges include the highest level of tracking prevention in Edge and strict Bing SafeSearch to filter out adult text, images, and videos from searches. Microsoft has provided 70 popular kids sites on an automatic allow list, but parents will have to individually add any additional sites on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDretV"&gt;This special mode actually restricts popular Windows keyboard shortcuts from working to prevent kids from exiting out, but the same shortcut restrictions aren’t in place on macOS, unfortunately. Once Kids Mode is enabled, an adult will have to input their Windows or macOS credentials to exit out and switch back to their normal browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sy7Fub8tzeNTLUN9VaHs4xnrkDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445678/Kids_Mode_blocked_site.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids Mode prompt to allow a website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ebDZqn"&gt;If a child attempts to view a site not on the list, there’s a block page where they can ask for permission from the adult. As this is privacy-focused and localized to the device, Kids Mode doesn’t require a Microsoft Account, nor will it sync your list of approved websites across devices. Unfortunately, that means you’ll have to set up multiple lists if you have more than one shared PC or laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgNXE8"&gt;The higher nine-to-12 age range also includes a news feed on the new tab page in Kids Mode, with curated articles from MSN for Kids. This won’t be current news, or the chance for your child to delve into politics at a young age, as the topics will be more focused on science, fun facts, and animals rather than the latest on the pandemic or geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXaEnewmxn4tt_fZu_-hTWAVgZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445680/Kids_Mode_Finding_Nemo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids Mode comes with a bunch of Disney and Pixar themes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TzEASO"&gt;Once Kids Mode is enabled, there are also options to customize the themes, colors, and new tab background. Microsoft has even teamed up with Disney and Pixar to offer special themes like &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/em&gt;, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q8mAl"&gt;Microsoft sees this as a “game-changer for parents,” and the simplicity and ease of use is certainly refreshing to see. “When we looked at the other content filtering and control offerings on the market today, we consistently found that most of them require a very lengthy sign-up process or a subscription, and generally don’t offer anything lightweight or catered for kids,” says Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfyRST"&gt;Kids Mode will be available in Microsoft Edge today for both Windows and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz finally allows a full look at the 2022 EQS luxury electric sedan </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/975JN1YOkH6o33560Kz4R_J3DeA=/194x0:4768x3049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131171/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_071.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;And it’s two-tone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="V3uiyU"&gt;Mercedes-Benz finally pulled the camouflage off its 2022 EQS electric sedan, and the two-tone paint job is sure to raise some interesting questions. The German automaker is still keeping several key details under wraps, such as the pricing, but as we said earlier, the EQS is a bold break from the current crop of minimalist electric vehicles with its big battery, huge infotainment screen, and richly appointed interior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bycpFz"&gt;When it arrives at dealerships in the fall of 2021, the EQS will be the first long-range EV from Mercedes available to buy in the US, beating out the EQC compact SUV, which has been delayed indefinitely. As such, it will be the first of nine other EVs that &lt;a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Plans-for-more-than-ten-different-all-electric-vehicles-by-2022-All-systems-are-go.xhtml?oid=29779739"&gt;the automaker plans&lt;/a&gt; to release by 2022. And as a close relative of the segment-defining S-Class, there’s a lot riding on the EQS and the company’s high-stakes effort to define the luxury EV market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQkDGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the EQS will be the first long-range EV from Mercedes available to buy in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBMbaW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; got the chance to drive the EQS last week&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ve already seen much of what Mercedes is announcing today up close. That includes the automatic front and rear doors, the 56-inch Hyperscreen with the company’s MBUX infotainment system, the augmented reality heads-up display, and the various other luxury vehicle accruements that felt both necessary and superfluous in equal parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g_z-H06OhNXZ6AVVK8BDAGSQgg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446004/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_078.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzPq51gaOiRBRbL4V3fAjDv883w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446003/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_077.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jJhK05gDlvi6984d36lupqfarCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446001/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_072.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5TMSF"&gt;This is our first look at some of the exterior details of the EQS, as Mercedes had previously kept the front and rear section under wraps. Gone is the all-digital front end we saw with the Vision EQS concept car, replaced with a “black radiator grille” with a “three-dimensional star pattern” that is also found in Mercedes’ AMG lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agl6B3"&gt;The headlights are connected by a light bar, a design that is becoming popular among EVs across different brands. There’s no hood ornament like you would find with the S-Class, but the EQS did keep the air vents on either side of the grille, eschewing the flat, vent-less face of the Tesla Model 3 and other EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y33WQn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The two-tone paint scheme in the images provided by Mercedes is certainly a choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TaYld5"&gt;The two-tone paint scheme in the images provided by Mercedes is certainly a choice, and it may prove divisive depending on your opinion about dueling exterior colors. It’s not completely out of the blue, though: Mercedes does offer &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/vehicles/passenger-cars/mercedes-maybach/the-exterior-design-of-the-new-mercedes-maybach-s-class/"&gt;a two-tone finish on its Maybach S-Class&lt;/a&gt;. And there is something to be said for an attempt to think outside of the monochromatic box. That said, this won’t be the only finish offered and a quick trip to Mercedes’ online configurator is sure to reveal other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6W5Mqw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10448030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0R6Tw5"&gt;The EQS will be available in two trim levels to start out: the rear-wheel drive EQS 450+ and dual-motor, all-wheel drive 580 4MATIC. Frustratingly, Mercedes did not reveal pricing information for either variant, though we should expect both to sell for over six figures. (By way of comparison, the base model of the S-Class is priced at $110,000.) Both models will come with a 107.8kWh battery pack, though Mercedes has said it also plans to sell a version with a smaller, 90kWh battery as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nYsqP"&gt;Built on a brand-new electric vehicle architecture for Mercedes, the EQS is expected to get 770 kilometers of range — or 478 miles — based on the European WLTP cycle. That number will most likely drop when it’s eventually tested by the US EPA, though it could still beat out the longest range Tesla Model S. Regardless, it’s plenty of range for daily driving or even medium to longer trips and will certainly set the standard for the luxury EV market.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1EYHy"&gt;Of course, EVs still represent a small fraction of overall car sales, and luxury vehicles alone won’t spur the mass adoption that policymakers say we’ll need to begin transitioning away from polluting gas-powered cars. But with the right combination of power, range, and affordability, Mercedes and other automakers will have their work cut out for them as we move closer to an all-electric future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FubjxT"&gt;Related: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V30Ivp"&gt;

    <title>Apple launches $200 million fund for climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izf-vlTMXN2F6fe7wIXn_FWU7_o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130995/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z0P1J5"&gt;Apple has created a $200 million fund to invest in forestry projects to help remove carbon from the atmosphere while also generating financial returns for its investors, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-and-partners-launch-first-ever-200-million-restore-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22385552%2Fapple-200-million-fund-climate-change-environment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Restore Fund will invest in forest properties that are managed to increase carbon removal and produce timber. The goal is to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoAfi6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332461/apple-carbon-neutral-2030-climate-change"&gt;Apple said last year&lt;/a&gt; it wants to eliminate its contributions to climate change and become carbon neutral by 2030. The company says it will directly eliminate 75 percent of emissions from its supply chain and products by 2030, and the Restore Fund will help address the other 25 percent of its emissions. Apple’s partners in the Restore Fund include the nonprofit Conservation International and the Goldman Sachs group which will manage the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1o3BP"&gt;“Through creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real, and measurable carbon impacts, we aim to drive broader change in the future — encouraging investment in carbon removal around the globe,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, said in a statement. “Our hope is that others share our goals and contribute their resources to support and protect critical ecosystems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vVCah"&gt;Apple said it will work with organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and Verra to help determine the projects in which it will invest. The company didn’t say what the fund’s target returns would be but said it would “unlock the potential of this natural solutions by scaling it in a way that makes it attractive to businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bkv7Ds"&gt;There’s some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;controversy around the strategy of using forests&lt;/a&gt; as a way of offsetting greenhouse emissions. The World Economic Forum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;launched an initiative last year&lt;/a&gt; to plant a trillion trees to cut emissions. But its effort cited a study that &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6494/eabc8905"&gt;greatly overestimated&lt;/a&gt; the impact such an effort would have on the environment, researchers later found. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hit a key climate goal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RH5rfLfFusvDjQUxGlsrmtXhMv0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130975/1232289899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UwtAkk"&gt;Facebook announced today that it exceeded&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one of its biggest environmental goals: it managed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 94 percent in 2020. It had previously pledged to cut planet-heating emissions by 75 percent. The company said that it had also achieved its goal of “net zero emissions” — not putting any more emissions into the atmosphere than it can take out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzcRqm"&gt;Facebook also announced that it had achieved another goal: it now purchases enough renewable energy to cover 100 percent of its global operations, which includes its offices and data centers. But that doesn’t mean that all of its operations are actually powered by renewables like solar and wind energy — at least not yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TwVE1E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy to cover 100 percent of its global operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IT7sOt"&gt;Renewable energy is on the rise, but most electricity grids still rely on fossil fuels. When companies can’t purchase enough renewable energy from utilities because there isn’t enough supply, they buy renewable energy certificates that signal that the company invested in renewable energy projects somewhere. Those projects can be located anywhere, and certificates have been sold for so cheap that critics say they &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/what-it-really-means-when-google-and-apple-say-they-run-on-100-renewable-energy-f6d1719fd865"&gt;don’t really lead to more renewable energy generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook also relies on renewable energy certificates, but it focuses on signing long-term contracts to support the construction of new solar and wind developments in the same places where it operates. It’s invested in 63 new renewable energy projects located on the same electrical grids as its data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbV9Um"&gt;Its next target is to reach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437208/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-greenhouse-gas-pledge"&gt;net zero emissions by 2030&lt;/a&gt; for its entire supply chain and other indirect emissions that come from things like employee travel and commuting. To hit that goal, Facebook says that it developed environmental standards for its suppliers. It also plans to rely more heavily on emerging technologies that draw carbon dioxide out of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6gVQ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Misinformation about climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UN4xcA"&gt;Facebook has recently also tried to limit misinformation about climate change on its platform. Last year, it launched a “Climate Science Information Center” in some countries. In the UK this year, it started adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288439/facebook-label-climate-change-posts-misinformation"&gt;label&lt;/a&gt; to some posts about climate change that redirect people to its information center. It all comes on the heels of criticism from activists and policymakers over how misinformation about climate change festered on the site, including one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368136/facebook-climate-change-fact-check-senators-warren"&gt;high-profile case&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook reversing a “false” rating that its fact-checkers gave to an op-ed based on inaccurate information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEpq3G"&gt;“We know the next 10 years will be the defining time for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and that we have a role to play in this effort — both as a platform that connects people to information and as a global company that supports climate action,” Facebook’s director of renewable energy, Urvi Parekh, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/renewable-energy/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHXVb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6mPJK6"&gt;“With more options for getting started, and staying active and healthy during pregnancy as well as at any age or fitness level, we hope even more people will be inspired to keep moving with our amazing team of passionate trainers,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CcRSMS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Fitness Plus review: easy mode","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="til5wu"&gt;The new “Workouts for Pregnancy” program consists of 10 workouts across Apple’s strength, core, and mindful cooldown categories. Each workout is about 10 minutes long and designed specifically for pregnant users, with variations and suggestions for modifying the exercises as a pregnancy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJglp0"&gt;“Workouts for Older Adults,” as the name implies, is a series of eight workouts meant for elderly users. The workouts are generally designed to use either light dumbbells or the user’s bodyweight and feature modifications to use chairs or walls to assist as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZP5AD"&gt;And for beginners who are new to working out (or starting again after a long break), Apple is adding new low-impact yoga, HIIT, and strength classes to help ease newcomers into fitness with basic exercises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOjr4S"&gt;Lastly, Apple Fitness Plus is also adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;new “Time to Walk” episode&lt;/a&gt;: an Earth Day-themed program featuring Jane Fonda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fT0ut9"&gt;The newly added Workouts for Pregnancy, Workouts for Older Adults, and Workouts for Beginners, as well as the new Jane Fonda Time to Walk episode, will be added to Apple Fitness Plus on Monday, April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHLW1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Peloton Bike Plus’ GymKit support no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCnBkghTitXn0Mle-7FbtFSOvSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130830/akrales210108_4344_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZiuLwt"&gt;Peloton debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a much-desired feature: GymKit support. But now, the company’s pulling back some of that functionality. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that GymKit no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes and instead will “only be available in cycling classes for now.” The spokesperson also said: “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines within Apple’s terms of service,” seemingly suggesting bootcamp workouts didn’t fall under those terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYdBuC"&gt;This change is a disruptive one for users who might have purchased the Bike Plus specifically for its GymKit support. It’s the first piece of hardware from the connected fitness company to support GymKit, and the direct Apple Watch integration makes tracking workouts easy, especially during Bike Bootcamp, which fuses cycling and strength exercises. Now, users will have to find a way to track these trickier workouts, like starting a cycling workout, ending it, switching to a strength-training workout, ending it, and so on. People can also try a cross-training workout, but that might not capture the entirety of the workout, either. When paired with the Apple Watch, the Bike Plus also displays users’ heart rates on the screen. This is also now gone from bootcamp classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfguh6"&gt;This is the reality Peloton users will have to deal with for the time being, at least until Apple starts supporting the bootcamp classes in its terms or Peloton figures something out on its end. I have a Bike Plus at home and use it with an Apple Watch, and I noticed the change immediately. It was upsetting! My output always seemed unusually high during bootcamp workouts, so it’s possible they weren’t accurate, but seeing my heart rate on the screen and having my workout automatically tracked was nice. I’m sad to see this functionality go, but I hope it might return in the future, albeit it with more accurate metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook Spin 513 with a Snapdragon 7c processor starts at $480</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/awz9VSnUVYP0v3XYI2qj0mq-zaI=/0x313:3000x2313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130817/Acer_Chromebook_Spin_513_CP513_1H_L__High_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dsskNS"&gt;We already knew Acer was working on the first two Chrome OS devices powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c chips. And today, the company has released two product listings for its Chromebook Spin 513, but you can’t buy this laptop just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wv9jHs"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-513-starts-at-479-with-snapdragon-7c/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;AboutChromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromebook Spin 513 with the Snapdragon 7c processor has two configuration listings that have appeared on Acer’s website, with a starting price of $479.99. Acer announced in October that the Chromebook Spin would start at $399.99. Additionally, both laptops also do not show 4G LTE for connectivity, which is something that was noted to be a configuration option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtiAuV"&gt;The key difference between the two is the RAM configuration, which is only a $20 price difference. Although the product listing for both Chromebooks include a “Buy Now” button, it is still not available for purchase yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5uyDQ"&gt;The Snapdragon 7c is an entry-level mobile processor that’s built on an 8nm process. Although it is one of the weaker laptop CPUs, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997402/qualcomm-arm-midrange-windows-laptop-processors-8c-7c-8cx-snapdragon"&gt;claims the biggest benefit&lt;/a&gt; for devices powered by this processor is a longer battery life; Acer claims its Chromebook devices powered by the Snapdragon 7c will offer a 14-hour battery life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Core wants to be the YouTube of game development, and now anyone can try it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MX1QhdIDkEs2h3i9TSHSMOenlsM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130744/CoreThumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Manticore Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtfUjM"&gt;Core, the platform that hopes to help creators build games and players experience them, is launching for free in early access today. It’s available exclusively on the Epic Games Store and already includes over 20,000 free playable games across a wide variety of genres including team-based multiplayer shooters, RPGs, and side-scrollers. Core’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;developer, Manticore Games, says that over a million players and creators have used the platform while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21158189/core-free-game-creation-tool-pc-youtube-twitch"&gt;it’s been in alpha over the past year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOZEA6"&gt;The aim with Core is to make it easier for creators to develop and monetize games, similar to what YouTube did for online video, while gamers get “an endless arcade of high-quality, user-built games and worlds.” The platform’s development tools are built on top of Epic’s Unreal Engine, and it offers premade assets that users can customize, as well as drop-down tools to build games. Custom avatars can work across different experiences, and these can be linked with in-game portals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fY_h_09WIkcdpi9t4zWmlmb-OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445619/CoreEditor4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Manticore Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core’s development tools let creators put games together using premade assets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4QpF7K"&gt;Core’s attempt to make game development easier and more approachable is similar to Media Molecule’s &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; on PS4. However, Manticore Games is attempting to distinguish itself by letting creators monetize their games via its Perks system, which &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201208005796/en/Manticore-Games-Launches-Perks-Core%E2%80%99s-Creator-Economy-Setting-New-Benchmark-for-UGC-Platforms-at-50-Revenue-Share"&gt;launched last December&lt;/a&gt;. Creators have different options for how to monetize their games, ranging from in-game cosmetic purchases to full-on monthly subscriptions, Manticore Games says, and it’s offering a revenue share of 50 percent with creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEYlHu"&gt;To coincide with the launch today, Geoff Keighley is hosting the Core Games Showcase, which will feature appearances from Core’s biggest games and creators. The show kicks off at 1PM ET on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/CoreGamesOfficial"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US institutes new Russia sanctions in response to SolarWinds hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris walk from the Oval Office of the White House, both wearing masks." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3A-1sR8p5K8Ytf_EStGA9LYbcuI=/0x0:4510x3007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130573/51101779936_dce643603a_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/51101779936/" target="_blank"&gt;White House / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfZQiS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/15/executive-order-on-blocking-property-with-respect-to-specified-harmful-foreign-activities-of-the-government-of-the-russian-federation/"&gt;A White House order issued Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt; directs the US government to expel ten diplomats and place a range of new sanctions on Russian individuals and assets in response to the SolarWinds hack. The order also &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126"&gt;places significant new restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on Russia’s sovereign debt, which will make it more difficult for the country’s government to raise money and support its currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJ2GPW"&gt;“Treasury will target Russian leaders, officials, intelligence services, and their proxies that attempt to interfere in the U.S. electoral process or subvert U.S. democracy,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “This is the start of a new U.S. campaign against Russian malign behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT31wo"&gt;Uncovered in December, the hack saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;more than 250 federal agencies and businesses&lt;/a&gt; compromised by a state-sponsored actor, which exposed a network security company called SolarWinds. The US intelligence service believes with high confidence that the attack was carried out by Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UItQVO"&gt;The sanctions also target 32 individuals believed to have participated in government efforts to influence the 2020 election, a troubling replay of the 2016 influence campaign that hacked members of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. One of those individuals is named Alexei Gromov, a deputy chief of staff in the Russian president’s office, who allegedly led a Kremlin effort that “sought to exacerbate tensions in the United States by discrediting the 2020 U.S. election process,” according to &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126"&gt;a Treasury Department statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Scr9dG"&gt;A number of private-sector cybersecurity firms in Russia were also sanctioned for their work supporting government efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDTuZl"&gt;Since February, the Biden administration has been working to remediate the attack and change federal IT practices to protect against similar attacks in the future. In March, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/03/12/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-administrations-response-to-the-microsoft-and-solarwinds-intrusions/"&gt;a White House spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; described the security failure as the result of “significant gaps in modernization and in technology of cybersecurity across the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AfZVa"&gt;The sanctions mark a new low point in US relations with Russia, made worse by reports that the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/russia-afghanistan-bounties.html"&gt;funded prizes for Taliban killings of US soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as President Vladimir Putin’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-health-idUSKBN2C02IP"&gt;ongoing retaliation against domestic opposition leaders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZU3Kj"&gt;“The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable,” the White House said in a statement. “We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory. However, we have also been clear — publicly and privately — that we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9WdkH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grab a 5G-ready OnePlus 8 for 50 percent off today at B&amp;H Photo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s7FSUBnLHe3LqmDXgCBkPhsS9lI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130542/vpavic_042008_3967_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYyAtE"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is once again offering the lowest price yet on the Verizon variant of the OnePlus 8. Originally priced at $800, you can &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615543-REG%2Foneplus_5011101036_8_5g_uw_smartphone.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get this model for $400&lt;/a&gt;. This phone typically costs more than the original OnePlus 8 model because it is compatible with Verizon’s mmWave network. However, because B&amp;amp;H is selling it as unlocked, it will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile networks if either is your preferred phone carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVbKLe"&gt;The OnePlus 8 includes a 6.5-inch OLED screen, a 90Hz refresh rate, and 128GB of storage. Despite its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, debuting a few weeks ago, at $400, this is still a great deal for people looking to upgrade to a 5G-ready smartphone and not spend a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8OcUxU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdpAQR"&gt;Woot is once again offering the lowest price on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. Normally $200, you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a new pair for $165&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes free standard shipping if you have an Amazon Prime account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqNe2O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTx0D8"&gt;If you own an Apple Watch, or recently purchased one in 40mm or 44mm sizes and you are looking to buy a new strap, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-sport-loop-for-apple-watch-40-or-44-mm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Daily Steals&lt;/a&gt; is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers the opportunity to buy an Apple Watch Sport Loop in select colors for $18 when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEAPLEW&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This price also includes a one-year warranty through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AGuII"&gt;Keep in mind; these are Apple-branded Sport Loops, which normally cost $49, and not a third-party band. Daily Steals also has several colors that are no longer available on Apple’s direct website. Only two colors (“pride” and “red”) are available in the 40mm size, while the 44mm model has six colors in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="flaypa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qh5P8O"&gt;Speaking of good deals, if you are interested in picking up Vizio’s Elevate soundbar, which includes 18 speakers and support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fvizio-elevate-p514a-h6-5-1-4-bluetooth-soundbar-speaker&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22384306%2Fone-plus-8-verizon-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-apple-watch-sports-loop-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots is still offering a deal on this product&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,000, you can get this rotating soundbar for only $779 when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGEVIZ &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YmEzTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPULB"&gt;On March 31st, Nintendo pulled &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars &lt;/em&gt;from the Switch eShop, and physical copies are hard to find these days. But if you missed out on picking up this compilation, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737841581771625414#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-3D-All-Stars-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596743%2F103673933&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals04152021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have physical copies of the game available for $50 — $10 off its original price. If you have yet to pick up a copy, now would &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; be a good time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
