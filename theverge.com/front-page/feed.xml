    <title>New Qualcomm CEO sees former Apple execs as key to beating M1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0mltVZY3kM-rUP2rOcALXXWqBM=/26x0:455x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535459/ca_mwc.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7p0LX3"&gt;Qualcomm’s new CEO, Cristiano Amon, has big plans for competing with Apple when it comes to laptop performance, thanks to the ex-Apple employees Qualcomm brought on when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;it acquired Nuvia earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes Qualcomm could make the world’s best processor, which would require designing a chip better than Apple’s M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvbyn8"&gt;Before assuming his new role as CEO, Amon was head of Qualcomm’s semiconductor division and was in charge of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;acquisition of Nuvia for $1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt;. The startup was founded by three former Apple engineers who specialized in chip design and worked on Apple’s A-series SOCs. Those founders joined Qualcomm, and it’s apparent now that they’ll be focusing on making chips for consumer computers (though the company wouldn’t turn down the chance to license its tech to data centers, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;). Qualcomm hopes to start selling Arm laptop chips, powered by Nuvia’s designs, next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jm3rlX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t added 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, to its M1 Macs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soFLVj"&gt;Amon also hopes to use the company’s experience in making 5G chips and smartphone processors to help provide a better laptop experience, by building 5G connectivity into its laptop-focused CPUs. Adding 5G, or any cellular compatibility at all, is something that Apple hasn’t done yet for its M1 Macs, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/macbook-air-and-pro-with-m1-opens-the-door-to-5g-it-cant-come-soon-enough/"&gt;despite demand from some&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;M1-powered iPad Pro has a 5G option&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NehvPD"&gt;It’s safe to say that if Qualcomm wants to become a dominant player in powering laptops like it is in the smartphone market, it has a lot of work to do. While Microsoft does use Qualcomm-designed chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496677/microsoft-surface-pro-x-refresh-sq2-processor-new-platinum-color-option"&gt;in its Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; (which made an appearance at the Windows 11 event), the list of &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile-computing/mobile-pcs"&gt;Windows PCs with Qualcomm inside&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a long one. It’s also unlikely that Intel is planning on just letting Arm take over the laptop space without a fight — the &lt;a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake"&gt;company is working on hybrid CPUs&lt;/a&gt; that, like Arm, mix high-power and efficiency-focused cores to provide better battery life, but using an x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxBCE8"&gt;Amon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ceo-focus-idUSKCN2E75QY"&gt;also talked to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about challenges and opportunities the company faces due to sanctions in China and about the company’s struggles to become a household name like Intel or AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors is now being investigated by the Justice Department</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKpJHzbiCZ39IV6h6FcUidSJMcU=/375x0:1125x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535245/lordstown_news_antvm.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MMpocp"&gt;The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into troubled electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors, which is backed by General Motors and went public late last year but has yet to get its pickup — the Endurance — into production, according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the second official probe into the startup, as the Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;opened an investigation earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; into Lordstown Motors executives’ misleading claims about how many preorders it had logged for the Endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHzchr"&gt;The new investigation, which is being run by the US Attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York, comes just weeks after Lordstown Motors’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;CEO and founder was pushed out&lt;/a&gt; following a law firm’s probe into those misleading claims. The startup’s chief financial officer and other executives and personnel close to the founder were also let go at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pifWiw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Newly public EV startups are suddenly under intense scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KhjKvw"&gt;“Lordstown Motors is committed to cooperating with any regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries,” a representative for the startup said in a statement. “We look forward to closing this chapter so that our new leadership – and entire dedicated team – can focus solely on producing the first and best full-size all-electric pickup truck, the Lordstown Endurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cL8LLK"&gt;It’s unclear exactly what the Justice Department is examining, though SDNY often focuses on financial crimes and allegations of fraud. The DOJ is also investigating electric trucking startup Nikola, and the SEC has opened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;a probe into fellow EV startup Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. The press office for the SDNY did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsVnYI"&gt;Steve Burns, the founder, started Lordstown Motors in 2019 after leaving his previous startup, another electric vehicle company called Workhorse. He essentially founded Lordstown Motors in order to buy a recently shuttered plant in Lordstown, Ohio where GM once built the Chevy Cruze. GM also took a stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTrMB0"&gt;The purchase — and the startup itself — received praise from the Trump administration. Then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;said Lordstown Motors buying the factory&lt;/a&gt; was “GREAT NEWS” for the state, and later featured the startup at a White House event. Former Vice President Mike Pence even appeared at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;the Endurance reveal event&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQrnvs"&gt;Buying the GM factory was supposed to give Lordstown Motors an edge over other startups that are building their own factories. Burns also found one with the truck, too, as he licensed intellectual property for an electric pickup that Workhorse had developed but never put into production — a deal worth millions of dollars for his former company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KtZYGm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"GM sells Lordstown factory to the offshoot of a struggling EV startup","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"},{"title":"GM-backed startup Lordstown Motors accused of faking preorders","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors CEO resigns after investigation into preorders","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wlBu5u"&gt;In 2020, Lordstown Motors was one of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;number of electric vehicle startups&lt;/a&gt; that went public by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;merging with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, a process that helped it raise $675 million. Afterward, Burns and the company touted that they had logged around 100,000 preorders for the Endurance in late 2020 and early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1paEuS"&gt;But in March, short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; that accused Lordstown Motors of, among other things, faking some of those preorders, and sourcing some to fleet brokerage firms that couldn’t afford the number of vehicles they were supposed to buy. Burns initially pushed back hard, saying “there’s always haters” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;quoting Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off” to a local news outlet&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;the company disclosed the SEC probe&lt;/a&gt; and launched its own review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUmOLw"&gt;In May, Lordstown Motors admitted that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;needed more money to survive&lt;/a&gt; and lowered the number of vehicles it hopes to produce by the end of 2021. It has also stopped work on its second vehicle, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt;an electric van&lt;/a&gt;, and said that it only has enough funding to last until May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vG9xT7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lordstown Motors raised $675 million in late 2020 but needs more cash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEoAfT"&gt;The review — conducted by a law firm with ties to Lordstown Motors — wrapped up in June. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;confirmed that Burns and others had made misleading claims about the preorders&lt;/a&gt;, and he resigned as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CJNo6"&gt;Lordstown Motors has since tapped another former Workhorse executive, Angela Strand, to serve as interim CEO. She is being paid $100,000 per month to serve in the role while the company hunts for a permanent replacement, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921085206/tm2119909d2_8k.htm"&gt;according to a recent filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC says Broadcom violated antitrust law with TV set-top box deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broadcom Expected To Beat Quarterly Earnings Expectations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AenBV5qFLmmJuNSZBuw0ToH1pVE=/116x0:5213x3398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535145/1321540122.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPsPIt"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission has sued chip maker Broadcom for allegedly abusing a monopoly on semiconductor components. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/1810205broadcomcomplaint.pdf"&gt;A newly issued complaint&lt;/a&gt; accuses Broadcom of threatening to charge higher prices, refuse technical support, or cut off chip sales if its customers bought other products from competing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWSiKw"&gt;Starting in 2016, Broadcom allegedly struck “exclusive or near-exclusive” deals with at least 10 companies manufacturing video set-top boxes and broadband devices like modems. It allegedly required these “strategic” partners to use a variety of Broadcom components even if they weren’t the best or cheapest option for a given device. Nonexclusive “tactical” partners were charged higher prices for slower product delivery and customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AUWfl"&gt;When manufacturers bid to have cable and internet providers like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon buy their products, the complaint says Broadcom “actively monitored” whether any of those products included components from Broadcom competitors. “Broadcom communicated to customers that disloyalty as to even a single bid involving a single relevant product could mean loss of strategic partner terms,” the FTC claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAEGlw"&gt;In one case, Broadcom allegedly retaliated against a company that hadn’t yet agreed to exclusivity, cutting off “all supply and support” when it submitted a bid that included a non-Broadcom component. The company allegedly withdrew the bid and signed the exclusivity deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ciBAfN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are pleased to move toward resolving this broadband matter with the FTC”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8IsCMD"&gt;The FTC wants Broadcom to &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/7._acco_-_broadcom_-_executed.pdf"&gt;sign a consent order&lt;/a&gt; agreeing to back off its restrictive exclusivity agreements. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Broadcom indicated it was willing to cooperate. “We are pleased to move toward resolving this broadband matter with the FTC on terms that are substantially similar to our previous settlement with the EC involving the same products,” said a spokesperson, referring to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/european-antitrust-regulators-settle-with-broadcom-a-year-after-interim-measures-flex/"&gt;a 2020 agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the European Commission. The EC agreement included a commitment to suspend all exclusive or quasi-exclusive deals and refrain from signing new deals with similar terms for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4Gn3r"&gt;The spokesperson said Broadcom was “equally pleased” that the FTC had not proceeded with an investigation into other parts of its business; the agency had reportedly been looking at &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-20/broadcom-chip-business-targeted-in-widening-u-s-antitrust-probe"&gt;potential anti-competitive practices&lt;/a&gt; in areas like Wi-Fi chip sales. “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to focus on supporting our customers through an environment of accelerated digital transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfL1rr"&gt;In its suit, the FTC claims Broadcom wanted to lock out potential competitors at a turning point for the set-top box industry. The complaint says Broadcom had particular dominance in the market for traditional broadcast TV set-top box components and faced more potential competition for streaming box components, a category that’s grown rapidly thanks to TV cord-cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJSV7A"&gt;Broadcom allegedly recognized that “as many consumers cut the cord, there are many other consumers who will continue using broadcast [set-top boxes] for some time to come,” and companies will need support for those boxes for years. “Broadcom recognized these threats and opportunities,” the complaint says, and it used its power to make sure potential rivals’ sales opportunities were “severely restricted.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPHIxc6qbeKB7raEULtvG27U7zw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69535023/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0063_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sxGtmt"&gt;Following last month’s announcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;that OnePlus was integrating with Oppo&lt;/a&gt;, effectively becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543184/oppo-oneplus-merger-brand-pete-lau-bbk-memo"&gt;a sub-brand of the phone manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/update-to-the-oxygenos-codebase-and-software-maintenance-schedule.1462181/"&gt;announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s also merging OxygenOS with Oppo’s ColorOS operating system (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/02/oneplus-android-update-schedule-years-oxygenos-coloros/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuNLqJ"&gt;Both companies’ software will remain separate and continue to serve their individual regions (OxygenOS for OnePlus phones globally, ColorOS on OnePlus and Oppo devices in China) but share a common codebase, which OnePlus says should standardize its software experience and streamline the development process for future OxygenOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14iqGm"&gt;OnePlus says the change will also allow the company to guarantee better Android update  support going forward, something Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;has also tried to improve on&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years. OnePlus lays out the life span for updates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exG21w"&gt;Flagship phones including the T and R models get three major Android updates and four years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dpAw7u"&gt;Nord and Nord CE phones get two major Android updates and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FOtNuJ"&gt;Nord N phones will get one major Android update and three years of security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIYDoF"&gt;OnePlus does limit those update commitments to the OnePlus 8 and up, so older OnePlus devices will be out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsAxF6"&gt;As the next step in whatever is going on with OnePlus, Oppo, and the wider BBK Electronics umbrella, merging the companies’ software on the backend seems like a net positive for OnePlus users. How independent OnePlus is now that it’s “integrated” seems about as unclear as when it was independent, owned by BBK, and seemingly sharing some parts with Oppo, but as long as phones are supported, it hopefully shouldn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internal Apple survey shows concern about hybrid work model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VJ1sL_BooPYAjFRe2TFOW0P1_DQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534632/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdAIoV"&gt;An internal survey designed by Apple employees shows respondents want the option to work from home and fear their colleagues may have to leave if the company forces people back to the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnm38"&gt;In the survey, which was sent out in early June, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they “strongly agree” with the statement “location-flexible working options are a very important issue to me.” A total of 1,749 people answered the question. Employees defined “location-flexible” as the option to work from home indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKJjwy"&gt;The news comes on the heels of Tim Cook’s announcement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;Apple will be rolling out a new hybrid work model&lt;/a&gt; that will require employees to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. While the move is a big shift for Apple, which discouraged remote work prior to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;it’s still too strict for some workers&lt;/a&gt;. They say that without the option to work from home whenever they want, some will be forced to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obip8K"&gt;The survey is not scientific — it was sent out in a Slack channel for employees to discuss remote work, and only a tiny fraction of Apple’s 147,000-person workforce likely even knew it existed. But the fact that well over a thousand employees participated in a grassroots survey that wasn’t sanctioned by Apple executives is significant. It hints at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a shift in Apple’s famously hierarchical culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvY73t"&gt;In response to the statement “I am worried that some of my colleagues will have to leave Apple due to LACK of location-flexible work options,” 58.5 percent said they “strongly agree.” A total of 1,743 people answered the question. A smaller portion — 36.7 percent — said they are worried &lt;em&gt;they’ll&lt;/em&gt; have to resign due to the lack of flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSIdpP"&gt;Employees sent the survey results to Cook and Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, on June 14th. They included a video with personal testimonies from 24 Apple workers on why remote working options are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nts8Qm"&gt;Two weeks later, Apple sent out a video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;doubling down on the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19vHQ"&gt;The video irked some employees, who felt executives hadn’t listened to their perspective. Even employees who don’t want to work from home forever say the company needs to consider more flexibility while &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/asia/virus-delta-variant-global.html"&gt;the Delta variant continues to surge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4E0oqS"&gt;While Apple is encouraging employees to get vaccinated, it’s not requiring everyone to wear masks in the office, saying instead that “choosing to wear a mask in places where protocols have been lifted is a personal decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsKatx"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche recalls Taycans over sudden power loss problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7KRz93wk3qaY_KPFgvq2nV20eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534559/porsche_taycan_0853.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6RtiZ"&gt;Porsche is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-recall-24987.html"&gt;recalling its first EV&lt;/a&gt;, the Taycan, to fix an issue where some cars suddenly lose power while in motion. The automaker has already sold around 43,000 Taycans globally to date, though it claims (without further clarification) that only a small number are affected. Owners will have to bring their electric Porsches to a dealer for the software fix, which the company says will take between 60 and 90 minutes. The fix is being applied to new Taycans coming off the production line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knGpdz"&gt;The same issue is also affecting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;new Audi E-Tron GT&lt;/a&gt;, as it is built on the Taycan’s electric powertrain. That recall involves far fewer vehicles, though, as Audi only just started shipping the electric sports car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXwxFn"&gt;At least a dozen Taycan owners &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/PORSCHE/TAYCAN%252520TURBO%252520S/4%252520DR/AWD#complaints"&gt;have filed complaints to date&lt;/a&gt; with the NHTSA about the power loss problem, enough that the safety agency recently opened a probe into the issue. The agency discovered that the power loss is being caused when the 12-volt battery — that classic rectangular battery which powers accessories when a car isn’t running — runs out of charge. If the 12-volt battery dies while a Taycan is in motion, it can shut off the much larger 800-volt battery pack that powers the vehicle’s electric motors and other critical systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AcR33"&gt;In a May &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21013-3828.PDF"&gt;filing&lt;/a&gt;, NHTSA says that all of the customer complaints so far claim that this power loss happened “without warning [or] error messages.” Six owners say they weren’t able to restart their vehicle after the loss of power. There are no known injuries at this time. Forum posts &lt;a href="https://rennlist.com/forums/taycan/1190625-ev-s-and-12-volt-battery-pitfalls-taycan-edition.html"&gt;from early 2020 show&lt;/a&gt; that this has been an issue for a while, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ke9dM8"&gt;“Our first priority is the safety of our customers,” Porsche said in a statement. “With this in mind, Porsche notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it will recall certain MY20 and MY21 Porsche Taycan vehicles to update the power electronics and engine control unit software. After recent review, Porsche determined that a software issue can, in certain instances, incorrectly and sporadically detect a potentially faulty communication and trigger a possible loss of motive power. A software update will help prevent this issue from occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRdqDh"&gt;Modern cars are full of all sorts of futuristic tech. But 12-volt batteries are still used to power low-level electronics, even in electric cars. And they can still cause problems like the one Porsche owners have been dealing with, despite there being a much larger battery pack on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dkwzS"&gt;Just a few months ago, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported, some owners of Ford’s new Mustang Mach-E electric SUV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;started reporting that they weren’t able to start their vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. The problem had to do with software that was stopping the 12-volt battery from recharging by sipping power from the bigger battery pack. When the 12-volt battery ultimately died, it basically made it impossible to start the electric Mustangs back up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVHSus"&gt;Porsche and Ford are not alone. Volvo has had issues with the 12-volt batteries in some of its electrified cars. So has General Motors with the &lt;a href="https://www.chevybolt.org/threads/12-volt-battery-issue.35408/"&gt;one in the Chevy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/09/15/tesla-fix-dying-12v-batteries-software-update-musk"&gt;Tesla has had trouble with this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktsktT"&gt;Most of these companies still used lead acid 12-volt batteries. While they have come a long way in some sense — newer “absorbed glass mat” versions that can last longer, for example — this type of battery still has limitations. Porsche uses a lithium iron phosphate 12-volt battery &lt;a href="https://www.taycanforum.com/forum/attachments/2020-porsche-taycan-drivers-owners-manual-pdf.3634/?hash=f1054d844b404c69dc097ac2448c927a"&gt;according to the owner’s manual&lt;/a&gt;, which is supposed to be safer and lighter than lead acid while also offering extended life, though clearly the company hasn’t worked out all the software kinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWPkxO"&gt;Tesla recently &lt;a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-12v-lithium-ion-battery/"&gt;switched to a lithium-ion 12-volt battery&lt;/a&gt; in the new Model S Plaid, though CEO Elon Musk has &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/in-epically-nerdy-interview-elon-musk-discusses-build-1846181756"&gt;also talked about the potential benefits of using a 48-volt system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest diversity report shows jump in departures among women of color</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_PY3kOyGlD9qbPOgXwy3KUcuYc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534379/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GxE7i9"&gt;Google’s latest diversity report shows that despite some gains in the number of Black employees, the company is lagging in its goal to double the number of Black workers by 2025. And the search giant is having particular difficulty retaining women of color, the &lt;a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/diversity.google/en//annual-report/static/pdfs/google_2021_diversity_annual_report.pdf"&gt;report released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AB9tx"&gt;Google uses a scale it calls an attrition index, with the number 100 used as a benchmark. The attrition figure for Black women on that index rose from 110 in 2020 to 146 in 2021, the report shows. Among Native American women the attrition index was up to 148 in 2021, compared to 123 in 2020. The 2021 attrition figures also were higher for Asian men and women and for Latinx men, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeNICs"&gt;“We recognize the platform that we have and the brand position that we have and we know that there are other companies that are watching us and looking at us,” Google chief diversity officer Melonie Parker &lt;a href="https://diversity.google/annual-report/"&gt;said in a video&lt;/a&gt; that accompanied the report. “And we want to make sure that we don’t just show our successes, but that we show the areas that we need to get better as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrkqRr"&gt;The company made some progress in its representation and diversity goals, doubling the number of Black employees hired to its US leadership team to 7.1 percent from 3.6 percent the year prior, and the number of women in Google leadership around the world rose from 26.7 percent to 28.1 percent. Still, Google’s US workforce is 68 percent male and 32 percent female, the report shows. Fifty percent of Google’s US workforce is white, compared to 42 percent Asian, 6.4 percent Latinx, 4.4 percent Black, and 0.8 percent Native American. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkC0Td"&gt;And Google faced a slew of criticism late last year and earlier this year, for how it handled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;firing of Black AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt; after she wrote a paper that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155985/paper-timnit-gebru-fired-google-large-language-models-search-ai"&gt;questioned the dangers of large language models&lt;/a&gt;. Gebru accused Google of racism and retaliation, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"&gt;faced online harassment&lt;/a&gt; for months afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yweqd6"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/progress-racial-equity-commitments/"&gt;CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the company planned to double the number of Black employees by 2025 and increase the number of underrepresented workers in senior positions by 30 percent. “We’ll hold ourselves accountable for creating an inclusive workplace,” Pichai wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkyXcx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKZhun"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhEI7d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot made some chill beats for creators to stream to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m33TaJPJ_VCR1GJUM7iirA17id4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534288/P3_still.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERfXBP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot is making something new — and very chill. The company just released an album called &lt;a href="https://found.ee/sessionsvi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sessions: Vi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is packed with 37 lo-fi tracks from producers like &lt;a href="https://chromonicci.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Chromonicci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://juniorstate.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Junior State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://laxcity.io/"&gt;Laxcity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://tennyson.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Tennyson&lt;/a&gt;. The idea, the company says, is to offer “stream-safe” music that creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch can use, without having to worry about copyright strikes. The album is available to stream now on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gWQRXX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Bait and Twitch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"},{"title":"Lo-fi beats to quarantine to are booming on YouTube","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21222294/lofi-chillhop-youtube-productivity-community-views-subscribers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fjW4U"&gt;In typical Riot fashion, there’s also a narrative album. The title is in reference to &lt;a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/vi/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; character Vi&lt;/a&gt;, a criminal with high-tech gauntlets, and Riot’s head of music Toa Dunn says the album is meant to reflect a day in her life. The tracks are divided into three main parts, with vibes to represent afternoon, sunset, and night. “It all comes down to storytelling. It gives a lot of context,” Dunn says of the structure. “This isn’t canon. We’re not trying to expand on Runeterra, but this is another look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqcX3G"&gt;Music has become an increasingly large focus for Riot, particularly within the fantasy realm of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;, with fictional groups like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21496800/kda-league-of-legends-k-pop-album-release-date"&gt;K/DA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;True Damage&lt;/a&gt; releasing albums and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;performing at esports competitions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Sessions&lt;/em&gt; represents a different direction, but one that makes a lot of sense, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;the constant tension between streamers and the music industry&lt;/a&gt;. And Dunn says there’s likely more music in the “sessions” line coming in the future as well. “This is drop one of who knows how many,” he says. “We plan to continue to learn and figure out more and more what people like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME5ZwY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LciM7T"&gt;A high-end Tesla Model S Plaid caught fire Tuesday night in Haverford, Pennsylvania, briefly trapping the driver inside, according to the local fire department. A lawyer for the owner said the vehicle “spontaneously combusted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Kmcb6"&gt;Firefighters from both the Gladwyne and Lower Merion Fire Departments arrived on the scene shortly before 9PM ET on Tuesday. The firefighters, who had been trained on how to respond to battery fires involving Tesla vehicles, “laid a 5 inch supply line into the scene so that we could keep a continual water stream on the fire to extinguish the fire and cool the batteries down to ensure complete extinguishment,” according to a statement from the Gladwyne Fire Department. The driver managed to escape and there were no injuries reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lf2Lgi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s Model S Plaid is a high-end, ultra-quick version of the automaker’s original electric sedan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a splashy event last month to announce the first customer deliveries of the $130,000 vehicle. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1410641707985641472"&gt;According to Ben Meiselas&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer who works for the firm representing the unnamed owner, the Model S Plaid was one of the first 250 vehicles shipped to customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uciJAm"&gt;“This is a harrowing and frightening situation and an obvious major problem,” said Mark Geragos, another attorney representing the owner. “Our preliminary investigation is ongoing, but we call on Tesla to sideline these cars until a full investigation can occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lFK7"&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars, but the topic has received increased scrutiny as more EVs hit the road. First responders are even being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;trained to handle EV battery fires&lt;/a&gt; since they can’t be extinguished via some traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uwWcy"&gt;Tesla’s vehicle fires have especially caught a lot of attention — to the point that Musk has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1120802953130995714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;publicly pushed back on the coverage of those incidents&lt;/a&gt;. Some companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357068/hyundai-kona-ev-recall-battery-fire-nhtsa"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18659983/audi-etron-recall-battery-fire-risk"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china"&gt;NIO&lt;/a&gt;, have issued recalls over the possibility of fires in their EVs. Others, like Jaguar, have experienced &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-05-02/deformed-chassis-put-nio-ev-on-fire-101410947.html"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; fires with &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/a-jaguar-i-pace-ev-had-a-thermal-incident-while-parke-1830995550"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H3KGBR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CpCSIU"&gt;Tesla has maintained that its cars &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport"&gt;are the safest in the world&lt;/a&gt; and self-reports annual vehicle fire statistics that are far lower than those found in gasoline-powered cars. The company has made multiple changes to the Model S over the years to reduce the risk of fires, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5MHSp"&gt;It shipped a software update in 2013 that &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/tesla-responds-model-s-fires/"&gt;made the Model S ride higher at highway speeds&lt;/a&gt; to lower the chance of debris puncturing the battery pack and added more physical protection to new packs coming off the line. Both those updates were sent after a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation into multiple fires. (The agency closed the &lt;a href="https://www.industryweek.com/safety/nhtsa-halts-investigation-tesla-fires"&gt;investigation in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.) Tesla also released a software update in 2016 to “provide extra security during charging” &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2016/03/17/tesla-supercharger-fire-update-software-short-circuit/"&gt;after a Model S caught fire in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw9J7M"&gt;Incidents involving Teslas tend to draw more media attention than other vehicles because of the company’s tendency to push the limits on technology, whether it’s battery density, partial autonomy, or vehicle design. Tesla is lauded by its many fans for its willingness to go beyond the comfort zone of more conservative, legacy automakers. And with that also comes more scrutiny from media outlets and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1iPEl"&gt;A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the fire, which is unsurprising considering the company has dissolved its public relations department and hasn’t responded to any inquiry in the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOAUuA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
