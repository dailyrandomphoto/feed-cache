    <title>Pinterest is the latest app to add a carousel of stories to its home screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDry4ccpNvBVbhW3_Rjl6g0tMFk=/5x0:4289x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721616/Creators_Homefeed_Bubbles_US__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yWCSCZ"&gt;Pinterest now displays a row of stories at the top of its home screen when you open up the app. It’s an interface that should look familiar to anyone who has used a social media app in the past few years: it’s the same tack taken by Instagram, Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and plenty more. The change will start appearing today on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bP0Q9n"&gt;“Story Pins” were introduced to Pinterest in September. They worked like pretty much any other story format, with short videos posted back to back that you could tap to move between. Where they differed most was how you found them: Story Pins appeared like any other post on Pinterest, as just another box on various grids of pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgkA2z"&gt;Now, those Story Pins will have an easier time standing out. They’ll appear at the top of the home screen, and the app will even suggest stories from creators you aren’t following. The change ought to boost engagement on stories, and it’ll likely encourage creators to start posting stories to the app even more, too. Pinterest’s stories aren’t ephemeral like most other apps’, so once creators make them, the videos will stick around and build up a library for the service to keep promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKDGkW"&gt;Pinterest still has one big limitation around Story Pins, though: not everyone can create them. They remain limited to approved businesses and creators for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has paid more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and others over the last three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cannes Lions Festival 2018: Day 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6dkCV8iMJyDLT_8VerKjcEGNOA=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721555/978599724.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Francois G. Durand/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gy3vql"&gt;YouTube has paid out more than $30 billion to creators, artists, and media organizations over the last three years, according to a new letter published by CEO Susan Wojcicki. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiZt9Z"&gt;In Wojcicki’s first letter to creators of 2021, the CEO spent some time addressing YouTube’s growth. The number of new channels that joined the company’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en"&gt;Partner Program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows creators to earn advertising revenue, more than doubled in 2020. YouTube also “contributed approximately $16 billion to the U.S. GDP in 2019, supporting the equivalent of 345,000 full time jobs,” according to an Oxford Economics &lt;a href="https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/e0c9e192232ef73e18a8ac1fcb0b84668bd16e36ae22d3586ba09408dfc3c852f5bdd3a54fd738f2ca983c8ce765c90dc26a565b7700ca8e6c80438dc462e8a5"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that Wojcicki highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCblcg"&gt;The letter also focuses on the work YouTube’s team still has in front of them. Mainly, transparency, especially where content strikes and advertising dollars are concerned. Wojcicki noted that at the “scale we operate, it’s hard for creators to keep up with changing Community Guidelines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjaNjB"&gt;Wojcicki’s letter states that YouTube wants to be better about communicating changes to avoid channel strikes. After three strikes within a 90-day period, a channel is terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt7FY9"&gt;“In December, I spoke with creator Charlie White from the channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq6VFHwMzcMXbuKyG7SQYIg"&gt;penguinz0&lt;/a&gt; after he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MoistCr1TiKaL/status/1331631598052192258?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about being given a strike for an older video due to a new policy,” Wojcicki wrote. “We know this situation is similar to frustrations shared by other creators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HGzEPl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wojcicki noted that at the “scale we operate, it’s hard for creators to keep up with changing Community Guidelines.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lXsqzP"&gt;One example that came up after the 2020 presidential election was YouTube’s decision to ban any videos that propelled misinformation about voter fraud. The new policy went into effect in December, but YouTube gave a grace period for creators to ensure none of their videos violated the new policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D6A7R"&gt;YouTube executives have also faced mounting pressure to do a better job of moderating the site and preventing misinformation from spreading. YouTube is now shifting its focus to vaccination misinformation. “We’re always working to strike the right balance between openness and responsibility as we meet the guidelines set by governments around the world,” Wojcicki wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpRgpa"&gt;One other interesting part of Wojcicki’s letter was a focus on regulation. A recent hot topic in tech policy circles is reform of Section 230, which effectively allows social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to operate without being liable for content people post. Wojcicki referred to Section 230 as an act that “enables us to both keep YouTube open and allow a large amount of content on the internet as well as take the actions necessary to protect our platform.” Although Wojcicki didn’t issue a stronger sentiment, she did bring up that the debate over Section 230 happening in Congress has caught the attention of creators like Hila and Ethan Klein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHusoL"&gt;Wojcicki’s full letter, which includes more details about creator revenue and an update on YouTube Shorts, the company’s answer to TikTok, can be read on Google’s blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bynx05"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI’s GS66 Stealth proves the RTX 3080 can handle QHD just fine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWpbvUzOvccJrfsD_mDViYZRBWE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721591/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn performed favorably at QHD resolution with the GS66 Stealth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A first look at the next trend in gaming laptops&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6qYdie"&gt;I had hoped that MSI’s GS66 Stealth for 2021 would look and feel a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;different than last year’s model — not that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;the 2020 version&lt;/a&gt; was particularly busted in any major way. In fact, the previous model was a few nips and tucks shy of reaching Razer’s high bar for gaming laptop design. But while the outside shell of this year’s model is exactly the same as last year’s, I can live with that because what’s inside is mostly all-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7c2Bh"&gt;The review unit we were sent was kitted out with the current pinnacle of mobile graphics tech: Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics chip, with 16GB of video memory (Nvidia also makes an 8GB variant). MSI also added a gorgeous canvas of a display: a 15.6-inch 1440p (QHD) IPS G-Sync screen with a fast 240Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dVG2z"&gt;The other specs in the review model are good, too, but not necessarily cutting-edge. It has 16GB of RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and the same big, four-cell 99.99Wh battery that was in the previous iteration. It is equipped with an &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/208018/intel-core-i7-10870h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz.html"&gt;Intel Core i7-10870H&lt;/a&gt; processor, which on paper is a slight step down compared to the &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/202329/intel-core-i7-10875h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz.html"&gt;Core i7-10875H&lt;/a&gt; in the previous model I tested, but I didn’t notice a difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6tNQ6K8haUWY4MrISWUCGXlQl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251172/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything from games and websites to desktop backgrounds look so crisp in QHD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ0MB9"&gt;Other minor tweaks worthy of mention include a bump up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22212938/wifi-6e-rollout-starting-2021-smartphones-tvs-laptops-vr-routers"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt; compatibility and Bluetooth 5.2. This laptop has an HDMI 2.0 port, so it’s limited to outputting 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per second. Of the things MSI updated in this year’s GS66, the HDMI port should have been a little higher on the list than Wi-Fi 6E. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer’s new Blade 15 and 17 Pro&lt;/a&gt; each feature HDMI 2.1, allowing 4K output with up to 120 frames per second to really take advantage of the hardware while connected to an external monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt9bpr"&gt;The refreshed GS66 Stealth lineup with RTX 30-series chips and either a 1080p or 4K display will be shipping in February, but unfortunately, the model with the QHD display won’t be available until sometime in Q2 2021. MSI doesn’t have a price nailed down for the review configuration, either. Given that assessing value is an important part of the review process, we’re reserving a score until the cost is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlYies"&gt;I’ve been testing the flagship configuration of the new GS66 Stealth for a week. General performance outside of gaming felt similarly snappy to last year’s model. A big stack of tabs in Microsoft Edge, alongside Slack and Spotify, didn’t slow this machine down. It didn’t perform nearly as well in our Adobe Premiere Pro export test, though. Tasked with exporting a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, the laptop took six minutes, 30 seconds, compared to the three-minute, 14-second export time that we got with last year’s model. (It wouldn’t be fair not to mention that this configuration has 16GB of RAM versus 32GB in last year’s model, but I plan to retest this once final drivers are released for the GPU.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JR0pBRhK98VTDTDYON4JvZlHA6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251176/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt; performed the worst of any recent AAA title I tested, but the numbers are still impressive.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="M40Vyy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10301829"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHyue"&gt;But the real question is: was Nvidia’s latest high-end graphics chip worth the wait — and can it keep up with a QHD display? The short answer is that, like my colleague Tom Warren saw on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;the desktop version of the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, this mobile variant is a big leap over what the last-gen RTX 2080 could provide. Since this is also the first generation of gaming laptops that offer QHD screens, it’s a little hard to compare the two, but there’s no question that games look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNNE23"&gt;The RTX 3080 with 16GB of video memory is capable of running some of the most demanding games in QHD well beyond 60 frames per second — with all graphical settings adjusted to max, and with ray tracing and other RTX settings activated, when applicable. That’s an incredible achievement. And if you’re someone who doesn’t always play the latest games as they are released, these specs will afford you even more headroom to power through your backlog, with a fantastic display to enjoy them on to boot. The IPS screen that MSI opted to use is rich with contrast and better viewing angles than I expected, and its G-Sync adaptive sync does a great job of keeping visuals free of artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQk3ZT"&gt;I was able to spend time playing &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, most of which have ray tracing and / or DLSS (deep-learning super sampling) graphical options to take further advantage of this powerful graphics chip. I tested it by running brief snippets of these games at 1440p and 1080p in order to see the gains from playing games at a slightly less demanding resolution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6556f7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10301825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn2TxQ"&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;don’t ship with built-in benchmarking tests, I simply ran around a variety of locales to stress-test the hardware (the other games have scripted methods for gathering performance metrics). As someone who’s used to playing games on a 1080p display, I was impressed to see such graphically intensive games run this fluidly, especially at a higher native resolution. (If you’re a gamer who wouldn’t be totally happy with some of the numbers above, you could probably improve the frame rate by knocking down a few graphical settings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Var6nM"&gt;As I mentioned up top, the design of the 2021 GS66 Stealth is note-for-note the same as last year’s model. The overall look is stellar, though, and I wish every gaming laptop had a trackpad this generously large. It has backlit keys that can be programmed to dazzle with RGB splendor through SteelSeries software, but that’s really the only element that reveals this is a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFSUis"&gt;Well, aside from the very loud fans. I noted that last year’s model was relatively quiet, even under pressure. I’ve heard laptops louder than this new RTX 3080 version, but the decibel level went high enough so that at times I felt I needed headphones to hear all of the in-game details. Of course, that differed depending on the game. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; made this laptop whir the loudest of the games I tested, while &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;actually ran fairly quietly by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eT4fmVn7Ip2xLZdyMjPb-8cHsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251177/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This QHD screen is pin-sharp, but importantly, it’s really vibrant, and the viewing angles are generous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3XMlL"&gt;I found other flaws with the design. The keyboard layout is still crowded, with the important function key placed awkwardly next to the control key, making it cumbersome to do simple tasks like adjust the volume and brightness. Also, the bottom of the laptop chassis still flexes in a slightly worrying way. I don’t think it’s liable to break under normal use, but for a pricey machine like this, the design doesn’t inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9mVYZ"&gt;Nvidia says that QHD-equipped laptops featuring RTX 30-series graphics chips will begin launching today, with systems from Razer, Asus, and Eluktronics launching first. For example, Razer’s &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0369BEA2-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Blade 15 with a 165Hz QHD screen and the RTX 3070 will price out at $2,199.99&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t gotten our hands on it yet, but we expect to find similar performance in models with similar specs. However, since not all QHD panels are created equally, it will be interesting to see how the others compare to the excellent display in MSI’s review unit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kT2h56Oz1XhD3XObu8TXkymHGWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251173/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t stop holding my eyeballs this close to the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2Ije5"&gt;If you’re looking to buy one of MSI’s non-QHD models today, there is a number of options. You can get a system equipped with a less powerful RTX 3060 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437098990828811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;, one with the RTX 3070 for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1611894-REG%2Fmsi_gs66_stealth_10ug_075_15_6_gs66_stealth_gaming.html%3FSID%3Ds1610634215938lifha52581&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,399.99&lt;/a&gt;, or with the new RTX 3080 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437267445605394" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,699.99&lt;/a&gt;. The specs start with a 1080p IPS display with a 240Hz or 300Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GS66-Stealth-10UX/Specification"&gt;MSI’s product landing page&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it will be possible to upgrade to a 4K 60Hz IPS display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzs0eR"&gt;Meanwhile, if you’re curious about how the RTX 3070 is shaping up while running alongside an FHD display, my colleague Monica Chin has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22008450"&gt;our review of the MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have a lot more coverage of laptops built with the latest RTX graphics chip in the coming weeks and months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cY1oIk"&gt;But the TL;DR is that the RTX 3080, working in tandem with the QHD display and everything else that this GS66 Stealth is packing, has fantastic graphics performance, reaffirming that a display like this really is worth spending extra for (if you can swing it). The sharpness of the 1440p display makes pictures and text more enjoyable and pleasant to look at — both in-game and with everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Flow X13 review: a game-ready 2-in-1</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A top-notch convertible with a pricey sidecar&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Y9Yo1A"&gt;If I saw the Asus ROG Flow X13 in the wild, I would never guess it was a gaming laptop. It’s a 13.4-inch 2-in-1 convertible that’s just 2.9 pounds and .62 inches thick. Flip the screen around, and you can use it as a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roJNTP"&gt;A 13-inch gaming laptop with those proportions isn’t unheard of, but it’s certainly unusual. How is Asus pulling it off? The secret is that the real gaming hardware is on the outside. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow X13 connected to the XG Mobile." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2c9wWT425-5rlEDyX6XnAw7jqg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259418/mchin_190421_4382_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Flow and its eGPU companion make an attractive pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIV7Df"&gt;On its own, the Flow X13 looks like a high-end productivity machine. Inside is AMD’s Ryzen 9 5980HS, a monstrous mobile processor with eight cores and 16 threads — making this undoubtedly the most powerful CPU we’ve ever seen in a 13-inch chassis. That’s paired with an entry-level Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 with Max-Q design, 32GB of memory, 1TB of storage, and a 16:10 3840 x 2400 touch display. (You can choose a 120Hz FHD display as well.)   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSrrTu"&gt;On paper, that’s an excellent multimedia device that could compete very well with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, in the $1,000-$2,000 price range. But Asus isn’t selling it that way: it’s selling it as an ultraportable gaming laptop and bundling it with its very own external GPU called the XG Mobile. Asus says this GPU will deliver power equivalent to that of a GeForce RTX 3080 — Nvidia’s top of the line. So here’s the kicker: for the moment, you can only buy the Flow X13 &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/search?q=rog%20flow%20x13&amp;amp;s_c=1"&gt;bundled&lt;/a&gt; with the XG Mobile. The configuration we have costs $3,299.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gjO0SK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10302650"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhsm36"&gt;That’s a lot of money. It’s more than any number of excellent high-end gaming laptops cost. It’s over $1,000 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13&lt;/a&gt; and more than twice the price of Asus’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;, the two best gaming laptops in the ultraportable class. The argument for it is that for $3,299, you’re essentially buying three laptops: one that’s competing with the Dell XPS 13, one that’s competing with the Blade Stealth, and one that’s competing with much larger systems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer’s Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt; (with the caveat that it needs an eGPU to keep up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itUNkb"&gt;I just wish those three laptops could be sold separately — and I wish I could give them separate scores. Because the Flow X13, on its own, is truly an excellent laptop and one of the most powerful 13-inch systems on the market today. But by positioning this as a gaming rig and slapping it with a $3,000 price tag, Asus has forced the Flow into the premium gaming category. And while it holds its own among competitors there, it still comes with more compromises than I’d want to see from a $3,000 product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7XeMF"&gt;I’ll start by explaining what makes the Flow X13 so great as a general-purpose laptop, because there really is a lot going for it. Not only is it light enough that carrying it feels like carrying nothing, but it’s also the coolest-feeling laptop I’ve used in the past year. The lid, the palm rests, and the bottom of the deck all have a ridged corduroy-ish texture that’s hard to resist running your hands over. It also gives the whole thing a sleek, futuristic look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTheBQ"&gt;Like many Asus laptops, the Flow X13 has an ErgoLift hinge that tilts the keyboard slightly off the table when the clamshell is open. This hinge was a bit more rounded than those I’ve seen on fold-under laptops in the past, and it wasn’t sharp at all in my lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow X13 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9Z3CC3EnN3CMcmYKMRozaAu55I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259421/mchin_190421_4382_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys have 1.7mm of travel and a 0.15mm keycap curve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QB9H9O"&gt;Another thing that’s great: the 16:10 screen. Most gaming laptops are still 16:9, but many high-end business and productivity laptops are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;starting to move&lt;/a&gt; to 16:10 and 3:2 displays this year. That’s with good reason: You get noticeably more vertical space with a 16:10 resolution, which means much less scrolling and zooming out throughout your work day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw7kWw"&gt;The panel is also compatible with the Asus Pen, and Asus says it’s “highly scratch-resistant.” While I didn’t go to great lengths to try to scratch the thing, I was struck by how resilient it was in general. I gave it a good amount of touchscreen use throughout my first day of testing, and I never noticed any kind of fingerprints or smudges left behind. One note: there’s noticeable hinge wobble when you’re using the touchscreen in clamshell mode, which wasn’t an issue for me but may be for some folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EPStim"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Asus says the display is “highly scratch-resistant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NbIHDh"&gt;Inside, this laptop is a whirlwind. The Ryzen 9 5980HS is clearly a powerhouse. It handled my decently heavy load of photo editing, Spotify streaming, and heaps of Chrome tabs and apps with no problem; I never once heard the fans spin up. The X13 could be a great choice for anyone who needs a 13.4-inch laptop for computational tasks or other heavy office or school work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyxH3L"&gt;Audio is also pretty good. It doesn’t get as loud as an external speaker would, but the bass and percussion are some of the best I’ve ever heard on a laptop. In the preloaded Dolby Access app, you can also switch between presets for music, gaming, movies, etc. The Flow also supports two-way AI noise cancellation for video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Flow X13 faces away from the camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xSo4fOM89irgc-Hkp-GSWmCdYE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259414/mchin_190421_4382_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a flashy ROG logo in the bottom corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Asus ROG Flow X13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c0arlFjI5gWukpeTAw_YspHuARo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259416/mchin_190421_4382_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cap that covers the eGPU connector is tiny, so make sure not to lose it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Asus ROG Flow X13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaDr6yxfUB0PJYoH7hWT-BLrbdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259415/mchin_190421_4382_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X13 Flow charges via its USB-C port when not plugged into the XG Mobile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wr2doE"&gt;And the keyboard, as Asus keyboards often are, is excellent. It feels quite similar to that of the Zephyrus G14, which was one of my absolute favorite keyboards of 2020. It has a resounding click, good travel, and very nice backlighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="X5ltAP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard has a resounding click, good travel, and very nice backlighting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MJdWcH"&gt;Finally, because this is a legitimate question with Asus ROG products: yes, there is a webcam. It’s nothing to write home about, but it does exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZpm4O"&gt;I really have only one complaint about this system, and that’s the battery life. While running my usual workload with the screen at 200 nits of brightness, even with Battery Saver on and bloatware uninstalled, the Flow X13 only lasted an average of five hours and 47 minutes. The high-resolution display is likely a contributor here — you may get slightly better mileage from the FHD panel. While playing &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;, the Flow lasted just over an hour and became unplayable 55 minutes in with 10 percent remaining.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The XG Mobile seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GHWj-8eTq6MJ6XhUxMJOOwVLRx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259420/mchin_190421_4382_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XG Mobile weighs just 2.2 pounds and measures 8.19 x 6.1 x 1.17 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YzFANI"&gt;I wish this review could stop there. Because what Asus has made here is a beautiful machine that could absolutely rival the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; as an ultraportable, 16:10 convertible. Battery life is really my only complaint. But since Asus has decided that this is a gaming laptop, we’re going to need to dive into how it handles games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJnEec"&gt;Let’s talk a bit about this XG Mobile thing. It’s small for an external GPU, weighing just 2.2 pounds; Asus says it’s only 6 percent of the size of a typical GPU. It connects to the Flow X13 with a proprietary connector that allows for up to 64Gbps of bandwidth, with another 10Gbps reserved for USB link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osYiKC"&gt;In addition to serving as an external GPU, the XG Mobile powers the laptop when it’s plugged in. (The Flow also ships with a regular 100W charger.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="t7jTtA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;XG Mobile powers the laptop when it’s plugged in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CUG9On"&gt;The eGPU also serves as an external USB dock with a whole bunch of extra ports. In total, it includes: one HDMI 2.0, one DP 1.4, one Ethernet jack, one DC input jack, four USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, and one SD card reader. That’s in addition to the one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type C (with DisplayPort 1.4 and PD support), one audio combo jack, and one HDMI 2.0b that are already on the laptop itself. All in all, a good selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow X13 in tent mode." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJd7WwpVp7y1mc8_9kkIlZLSHXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259422/mchin_190421_4382_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the XG Mobile connected, the X13 Flow can power up to four displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyHUOl"&gt;I ran five popular games on the ROG Flow at 1920 x 1080 resolution, both with and without the XG Mobile. I also ran them at native resolution (with the XG Mobile). All games were run at their highest possible settings; in 4K, they were run with DLSS on and ray tracing off (where applicable). Take a look at the results in the chart below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KFWqos"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10302666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sy7K1"&gt;As you can see, these frame rates are respectable. You should be able to play whatever game you want at 1080p without needing to bump the graphics down, and you can even play some at native resolution. Even so, my overall reaction here is “Meh.” To illustrate why, I’ll pull out a few comparisons. (This is all with the usual caveat that relative performance will always vary by title.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Who2Be"&gt;While using the GTX 1650, the X13 ran &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at an average of 40fps. The Razer Blade Stealth 13 ran that title at 45fps, and the Zephyrus G14 ran it at 74fps. The Zephyrus also beat the Flow on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;, averaging 31fps to the Flow’s 29fps. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;wouldn’t allow me to max out every slider due to available memory, so this system is further behind the Zephyrus than that score makes it appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c3NFAe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My overall reaction here is “Meh”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvxfHH"&gt;Both of these laptops are comparably portable to the Flow X13 and just as well-built; they have worse processors and better GPUs. They also both cost over $1,400 less than this Flow X13 bundle. So if you’re looking to actually &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; on the go, rather than just do office work, think about whether you’d rather have one of those much more affordable devices with better frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W53dzu"&gt;But I’d still be on board with a $3,299 bundle price if the X13 Flow and XG Mobile delivered exceptional performance with no compromises — &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if it put 4K gaming on the table. The good news is that this external GPU does provide an acceptable 4K gaming experience (especially on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, the easiest game on here). But eGPUs generally come with some sort of performance penalty, and I’m seeing that on some of these titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAiK7T"&gt;For comparison, we can look to the Razer Blade Pro 17, a GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q system in the same price neighborhood as the Flow X13 bundle. (Our 2080 Super Max-Q configuration was $3,199.) The XG Mobile clearly has no trouble with easier titles like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, where it breezed past all of the laptops mentioned here. But it struggled with more intense fare, and ray tracing in particular. The Blade Pro 17 averaged 95fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing maxed out, where the Flow X13 and the XG Mobile averaged 76fps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review"&gt;Asus’ Zephyrus Duo 15&lt;/a&gt;, also with a 2080 Super Max-Q, also handily beat the Flow there, averaging 87fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88OiAL"&gt;And the Flow is also coming in behind more affordable systems with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3070 — the $1,899 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22008450"&gt;MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt; beat it on both &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt;, and essentially tied it on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgKloZ"&gt;So overall, whether you’re getting better frame rates from the XG Mobile or a larger gaming laptop will be somewhat title-dependent — but it’s clear that we’re seeing a performance penalty on some popular games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG X13 Flow seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bex_-4q2YzfvdMXa01SgN8fZjqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259417/mchin_190421_4382_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X13 Flow is an innovative gaming rig, but it asks some compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YGDHZl"&gt;So here’s the best argument for the ROG Flow X13. During the day, you can use it as a work and entertainment laptop, with a great screen, a comfortable keyboard, full audio, and a phenomenal processor that can handle whatever tasks you throw at it. Maybe you can play a game or two, if you bump down the resolution. When you’re home at night, put the Flow on your desk and pop in the XG Mobile, and it becomes a premium gaming laptop with 4K chops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EyCFa"&gt;That’s fine; I’m all for that. But prospective buyers should be aware that in creating a laptop that essentially functions as three laptops (an XPS 13, a Stealth 13, and a Pro 17), you’re making compromises in each use case. In the ultrabook category, it’s the battery life. In the portable gaming category, it’s the low-powered graphics card and the massive uptick in price. And in the desktop-replacement category, it’s the eGPU performance cost, which may or may not be significant depending on the games you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YK3SlX"&gt;Reviewers throw this phrase around to describe all kinds of laptops, but it’s very true here: in attempting to be a jack of all trades, this laptop is a master of none. And while the Flow X13 is a top-notch convertible, and an impressive achievement from Asus, it also costs over $3,000. If you need both a high-performance office laptop and a high-performance gaming laptop in one, and you have that kind of change to throw around, I won’t stop you. But those who primarily need one or the other should be better able to fulfill their needs with something more affordable, whether it’s a high-end 2-in-1 or a portable gaming rig. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI GP66 Leopard review: substance over style</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Step-up performance at the right price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9wXGDf"&gt;If you’re looking for a gaming rig that’s a step above the budget price point but still more affordable than the flashiest PCs on the market, you’re looking for MSI’s Leopard line. With a starting price of $1,599 ($1,899 as tested), the 2021 GP66 Leopard takes the same top-end chips that are in the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536996/msi-ge66-raider-dragonshield-edition-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;MSI’s GE66 Raider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt; and puts them in a less exciting, more affordable chassis. In this case, that’s Intel’s eight-core Core i7-10870H and Nvidia’s brand-spanking-new RTX 3070 mobile graphics card — components you’ll also see in luxury gaming flagships across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nr1qL0"&gt;That’s the clear argument for the GP66. If you’re willing to make some compromises (particularly when it comes to the chassis and the battery life), you can get high-end gaming performance at a midrange price point. Thanks especially to the RTX 3070, these are some of the best frame rates you’ll find below $2,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XhJX3"&gt;The GP66 Leopard is a revamp of the 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/MSI-GP65-Leopard-9SE-Laptop-Review-The-best-screen-on-a-mid-tier-gaming-laptop.431863.0.html"&gt;GP65 Leopard&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the RTX 3070, MSI made at least one other major change: its design. The changes are subtle, but they add up to a machine that looks a bit more professional and a bit less gamer-y. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IRhemx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10297572"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b5FEyB"&gt;For one, the GP66 is noticeably thinner — it’s 0.92 inches thick, while its predecessor was 1.08 inches thick. There’s also a new hinge design, which leaves less visible space between the display and the keyboard deck, and is meant to make the clamshell easier to open with one hand. MSI sent a dummy GP65 specifically to verify this claim, and I can confirm that the GP66 is much easier to open. The lid, which had a red MSI logo on the GP65, is all-black on the GP66, and the two raised ridges in the center of the GP65 that gave the laptop a distinctively “gamer” look are gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG1WA1"&gt;But the keyboard deck is where the Leopard has matured the most. MSI eliminated the GP65’s stiff discrete clickers in favor of a smooth, modern touchpad. The keyboard keys, which looked and felt quite plasticky on the last model, have been upgraded to a wider design that more closely resembles those of the &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade line&lt;/a&gt;. (Don’t worry: Per-key RGB backlighting remains.) The clunky dedicated buttons the GP65 had for toggling the power and fan profiles are gone as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2kQhXo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10303144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Uq8xsT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10297589"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qF7yUh"&gt;That doesn’t mean this is the best-made laptop around. The chassis has a bit of a plasticky feel compared to many more expensive models, and the touchpad wasn’t as smooth as I’d like — I often found my fingers skidding. But I’m happy with the revamp all the same. It’s a smoother, sleeker look — a Leopard for 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKP4By"&gt;One more design change: MSI moved a bunch of ports to the rear of the chassis. There’s one Type-C USB 3.2 Gen 2 with DP1.4, one HDMI 2.0, one RJ45, and one power port back there, in addition to a Type-A USB 3.2 and an audio combo jack on the left and two Type-A USB 3.2 on the right. That means the GP66 actually has fewer ports than its predecessor, which was able to fit in a miniDP 1.4, separate input and output audio jacks, and an SD card reader (though that reader was frustratingly slow according to &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/MSI-GP65-Leopard-9SE-Laptop-Review-The-best-screen-on-a-mid-tier-gaming-laptop.431863.0.html"&gt;reviewers&lt;/a&gt;). On the other hand, having so many ports crammed together on the sides of a device can make cable management a frustrating endeavor, so I’m glad that MSI has been able to spread them out. In particular, having USB-A ports on both sides is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6w4FG2"&gt;Let’s get into the second thing that’s new with this machine: the RTX 3070. This graphics card was unveiled at Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;CES 2021 keynote&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago, along with the rest of the new RTX 3000 mobile line. Nvidia said the chip would deliver speeds up to 1.5 times faster than those of RTX 2070 systems. In my testing, the GP66 didn’t quite display that large of a bump on every title, but it wasn’t too far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di1Jpw"&gt;(My test unit also included an Intel Core i7-10870H, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, in addition to a 1920 x 1080 240Hz display with 3.5ms response time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="WwVIvA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10297617"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qGG88K"&gt;The tl;dr is that pretty much any game you want to play, you can play. All of the games here were tested at their highest possible settings, and none of them gave the RTX 3070 any trouble. The GP66 averaged 96FPS on &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;; gameplay looked fantastic without a stutter to be seen. It averaged 75FPS on the highly demanding &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;, with a minimum of 55FPS on the game’s built-in benchmark. Those are both significantly better results than we saw from MSI’s flagship &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/k792L" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GE66 Raider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202006AM100000008"&gt;Asus’s ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt;, both of which use an RTX 2070 Super, and both of which cost several hundred dollars more for comparable specs. It’s also (unsurprisingly) a step up from MSI’s high-end &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; that’s equipped with an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Gp66 Leopard seen from above, half closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Tpr3D86NOHHVy_yCS9Ko40SY6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259914/mchin_190417_4380_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI’s dragon remains, but the red is gone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="URqz1W"&gt;Ray tracing was also no problem: The Leopard put up 82FPS on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with the feature on its Ultra setting. The Raider and the Strix averaged 70FPS and 67FPS, respectively, on that title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vz053n"&gt;With esports titles, you can take full advantage of the 240Hz screen. The GP66 maxed out &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; (which goes up to 250FPS) and averaged 169FPS on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; (where the Raider only averaged 124FPS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QP9AQ"&gt;The Leopard employs MSI’s “Cooler Boost 5” system, which includes two fans and six heat pipes. Cooling was good throughout; the CPU never passed 88 degrees Celsius during gaming. I never heard the fans during my regular multitasking, but there was sometimes an annoying coil whine that swapping to the Silent Fan profile didn’t always eliminate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI GP66 Leopard seen from the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlSBt7tb8qSUr4st_-Jca8EWObk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259919/mchin_190417_4380_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can switch between cooling profiles to eliminate fan noise when you’re not stressing the machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qThxhU"&gt;While some gaming laptops can double as drivers for media work, the GP66 wouldn’t be a great choice for creative professionals because its screen maxes out at 205 nits. That’s dim, even for a mid-tier gaming laptop. The system also wasn’t quite as dominant in Premiere Pro as it was in gaming — it took five minutes and 21 seconds to export a 5-minute, 33-second video that the GS66 Stealth completed in three minutes and 14 seconds. On the bright(er) side, the GP66’s display does cover 100 percent of the sRGB gamut and 80 percent of AdobeRGB, which means your games should look nice and vibrant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZOtTP"&gt;When it came to regular multitasking and office work, I didn’t experience any performance issues with the GP66. I ran into a number of bugs with the last MSI product I reviewed, the GE66 Raider, but am happy to report that they all seem to have been fixed. The Dragon Center app (where you can swap fan profiles and customize other settings) was so crash-prone and glitchy when I used it last October that MSI had to tap into my review unit and troubleshoot, but it’s quite smooth and responsive now. I’ve also previously had some trouble with the SteelSeries engine, where you customize keyboard colors and effects, but it was easy to use here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI GP66 Leopard keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QArUr_lsxHqwuBih5J_1RjTxt4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259911/mchin_190417_4380_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No backlight bleed at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DAucQS"&gt;Battery life, though, is a major area where the GP66 isn’t ahead of its competition. I was averaging three and a half to four hours from the 4-cell 65Whr brick, with consistent multitasking in around a dozen Chrome tabs with the screen at 200 nits of brightness. That’s not great news for anyone who was hoping to work on the go, especially considering how heavy the 230W charger is to carry around. This unit also came preloaded with Norton Antivirus, which can drain power, so make sure to uninstall that if you want the longest possible lifespan. (Premiere Pro results also improved significantly after I nuked Norton.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hZSch"&gt;Finally, on sound. The GP66 includes two 2-watt speakers. As is usually the case with laptop speakers, treble tones were much stronger than the middle ranges, while bass and percussion were subdued. Game audio was fine with a decent surround quality — but not the best I’ve ever heard, and not as good as you’d get from a decent external speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpfNgB"&gt;The GP66 also comes preloaded with Nahimic customization software, which lets you swap between audio presets for Music, Movie, Communication, and Gaming, and manually adjust equalizer settings. There’s a “Surround Sound” feature you can turn on and off (I didn’t notice a huge difference), and a “Volume Stabilizer” that’s supposed to keep your audio audible without waking people up (this did change the sound, though I wasn’t able to test its efficacy on any sleeping roommates). You can also customize the built-in microphones for conferences and chats — there are toggles for echo cancelation, static noise suppression, and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OnONe"&gt;The GP66 Leopard isn’t a perfect laptop. Between the plasticky texture, the skid-prone touchpad, the dim screen, and the preloaded bloatware, it’s clear where MSI has had to cut some corners. And while I certainly enjoy the modest all-black chassis, gamers who need RGB lights everywhere may still prefer the likes of the Raider and the Strix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaQaAT"&gt;But the Leopard excels in the area that matters most: game performance. Not only does it blow budget competitors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt; out of the water, but thanks to the new RTX 3070 it’s a significant step up from today’s luxury gaming laptops while remaining a large step down in price. With a powerful new chip and a fresh modern design, the GP66 Leopard is an excellent new product to kick off 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego Vidiyo is a new augmented reality-powered version of TikTok — for your Minifigures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5lDjnDARNTdcIhrOTh9zTbYuBc=/0x250:1500x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721532/Character_kids_and_BeatBits.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m9xt1t"&gt;Lego is launching a new, augmented reality social video service called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuLKhyzj8HI"&gt;Vidiyo&lt;/a&gt; that will let users create their own music videos and dance clips and share them with friends, all while applying their own effects and styles to the videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdWRkc"&gt;It sounds a lot like TikTok but aimed at younger children with strict moderation built in, and a Lego twist that makes most of the UI built in real-world Lego bricks instead of toggles in an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgDt4v"&gt;To create a Vidiyo, users will have to download the app and select a song (the toy company is partnering with Universal Music Group, so there will be a wide variety of licensed songs from actual bands to choose from, like 5 Seconds of Summer or Imagine Dragons). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BgMTUk487FHr1RNlpjIMXY5MenU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260265/Character_and_BeatBits.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lego Vidiyo character with BeatBits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qSgmRc"&gt;But instead of just selecting a filter and dancing away, kids will instead scan a Lego Minifigure to star in the video, along with any Lego “BeatBit” tiles — 2 x 2 bricks that unlock the various digital AR effects in the app. Then, kids will be able to dance away to the music — alongside a full-sized version of their Lego character in AR — before editing and sharing the clip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coHTTu"&gt;One of the key aspects that Lego hopes will set Vidiyo apart, though, is its content moderation. All content uploaded to the app has to pass a moderation test first, and any content that features “personally identifying information” — like real people in a video — won’t be allowed to be uploaded. (Although kids will still be able to watch their videos starring themselves locally.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0IQnxqoI8tE8tTcTPi8DfEZqq9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260271/BeatBits_overview2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BeatBit tiles for Lego Vidiyo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VIXayd"&gt;There’s still a lot of information that Lego hasn’t revealed yet about Vidiyo, including how much sets will cost, but the company does promise that more information will be on the way before the first Lego Vidiyo products launch on March 1st. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter buys into newsletters with Revue acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x58VOPLKov563nFNEHvqZTlyHDs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721482/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UqAK9"&gt;Twitter is acquiring Revue, an email service that lets writers publish newsletters. The move allows Twitter to capitalize on its user base of writers, journalists, and publications that regularly use the service to reach readers and grow their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mfqlhy"&gt;“With a robust community of writers and readers, Twitter is uniquely positioned to help organizations and writers grow their readership faster and at a much larger scale than anywhere else,” &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html"&gt;explains Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour&lt;/a&gt;. “Our goal is to make it easy for them to connect with their subscribers, while also helping readers better discover writers and their content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBcn9i"&gt;Twitter’s acquisition of Revue also places it in direct competition with Substack, a rival email newsletter service that has been growing in popularity recently. A number of high-profile journalists have left traditional media companies to start paid newsletters on Substack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCsXt9"&gt;Substack launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22174000/substack-rss-reader-newsletter-subscriptions"&gt;a reader feature for newsletters&lt;/a&gt; in December and has pledged to take a fairly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196035/substack-moderation-policy-detailed"&gt;relaxed approach&lt;/a&gt; to content moderation on its service. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel interviewed Chris Best, co-founder and CEO of Substack, last month if you’re interested in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast"&gt;learning more about what could be a new model for journalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cTjsHd"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/5Qz5OO1QuiXsc30r17tnDs" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 232px;" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxUBdF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/technology/twitter-revue-newsletter.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter was even discussing acquiring Substack back in November, but co-founder Hamish McKenzie made it clear &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1323116718810693633"&gt;the deal wasn’t going to happen&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter is now making Revue Pro’s features free for all accounts and lowering the cut it takes on paid newsletters to just 5 percent. It’s clearly an attempt to attract more writers to Revue, and it undercuts Substack’s 10 percent fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtZJWb"&gt;Revue was originally founded in 2015 in the Netherlands, and &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports it has six employees. It’s a small operation that counts the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;publisher Vox Media as users of the service. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;used to publish &lt;em&gt;The Interface&lt;/em&gt; through Revue, before its author, Casey Newton, launched his own Substack newsletter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XgiPa"&gt;Twitter says it plans to continue operating Revue as a standalone service. “We will continue to invest in Revue as a standalone service, and its team will remain focused on improving the ways writers create their newsletters, build their audience and get paid for their work,” says Beykpour. “Over time, this team will build more discovery, reading, and conversational experiences centered around long-form content on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google warns of ‘novel social engineering method’ used to hack security researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVXrtAYqXsCtJ1AcGGDD2VX23YQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721068/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3w9Tck"&gt;Government-backed hackers based in North Korea are targeting individual security researchers through a number of means including a “novel social engineering method,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/"&gt;Google’s Threat Analysis Group is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign has reportedly been ongoing for several months, and worryingly appears to exploit unpatched Windows 10 and Chrome vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiPI1D"&gt;Although Google doesn’t say exactly what the aim of the hacking campaign is, it notes that the targets are working on “vulnerability research and development.” This suggests the attackers may be trying to learn more about non-public vulnerabilities that they can use in future state-sponsored attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3jrxfc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hackers set up a network of Twitter accounts and a cybersecurity blog&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3njngg"&gt;According to Google, the hackers set up a cybersecurity blog and series of Twitter accounts in an apparent attempt to build and amplify credibility while interacting with potential targets. The blog focused on writing up vulnerabilities that were already public. Meanwhile, the Twitter accounts posted links to the blog, as well as other alleged exploits. At least one of the purported exploits was faked, according to Google. The search giant cites several cases of researchers’ machines having been infected simply by visiting the hackers’ blog, even when running the latest versions of Windows 10 and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVxzWD"&gt;The social engineering method outlined by Google involved contacting security researchers, and asking them to collaborate on their work. However, once they agreed, the hackers would send over a Visual Studio Project containing malware, which would infect the target’s computer and start contacting the attackers’ server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHfHb4"&gt;According to Google, the attackers used a range of different platforms — including Telegram, LinkedIn and Discord — to communicate with potential targets. Google listed specific hacker accounts &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt;. It says anyone who’s interacted with these accounts should scan their systems for any indication they’ve been compromised, and move their research activities onto a separate computer from their other day-to-day usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8vfr2"&gt;The campaign is the latest incident of security researchers being targeted by hackers. Last December, a leading US cybersecurity firm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;FireEye disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it had been compromised by a state-sponsored attacker. In the case of FireEye, the target of the hack were internal tools it uses to check for vulnerabilities in its client’s systems. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original Celeste now has a sequel you can play in your browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U0E70gbphXoO2TwoYrqSwiq8EgU=/0x74:500x407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720898/celeste_classic_sequel_gif.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="83jz55"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; was one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18137458/best-video-games-2018-xbox-ps4-switch"&gt;most acclaimed games of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but what you may not have known is that the tightly designed platformer was an expanded version of a smaller project developed in four days at a game jam. Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry created the original &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; for the Pico-8 platform, and now that version has a sequel called &lt;em&gt;Celeste 2: Lani’s Trek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mizVYw"&gt;The developers, now including composer Lena Raine, say that this game took just three days to make. The release is to celebrate the third anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;’s release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We said we probably wouldn't make a sequel to Celeste, but we never said anything about Celeste Classic&lt;/p&gt;— Maddy Thorson (@MaddyThorson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaddyThorson/status/1353862386084581376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="AtB9ws"&gt;If you’re not familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php"&gt;Pico-8&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a “virtual console” that gives developers a framework to build games as if it were actual hardware with defined technical capabilities. Games are limited to 128 x 128 resolution, for example, and a specific 16-color palette, which results in a distinctive look. Games can be accessed through the Pico-8 front end itself or distributed separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hUgM3"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Celeste 2&lt;/em&gt;’s case, you can download Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi versions for free &lt;a href="https://mattmakesgames.itch.io/celeste-classic-2"&gt;from Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, or play it in your browser at that link. (I would strongly recommend using a controller, since the keyboard controls are... tricky.) The soundtrack is also available &lt;a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/celeste-classic-2-lanis-trek-original-sound-version"&gt;on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook users’ phone numbers are for sale through a Telegram bot</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ss4OD"&gt;Someone has gotten their hands on a database full of Facebook users’ phone numbers, and is now selling that data using a Telegram bot, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz7bd/facebook-phone-numbers-bot-telegram"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The security researcher who found this vulnerability, Alon Gal, says that the person who runs the bot claims to have the information of 533 million users, which came from a Facebook vulnerability that was patched in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gIirt"&gt;With many databases, some amount of technical skill is required to find any useful data. And there often has to be an interaction between the person with the database and the person trying to get information out of it, as the database’s “owner” isn’t going to just give someone else all that valuable data. Making a Telegram bot, however, solves both of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pp8v0H"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Few days ago a user created a Telegram bot allowing users to query the database for a low fee, enabling people to find the phone numbers linked to a very large portion of Facebook accounts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This obviously has a huge impact on privacy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/lM1omndDET"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lM1omndDET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alon Gal (Under the Breach) (@UnderTheBreach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1349671417625931778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xs9d8L"&gt;The bot allows someone to do two things: if they have a person’s Facebook user ID, they can find that person’s phone number, and if they have a person’s phone number they can find their Facebook user ID. Though, of course, actually getting access to the information you're looking for costs money — unlocking a piece of information, like a phone number or Facebook ID, costs one credit, which the person behind the bot is selling for $20. There’s also bulk pricing available, with 10,000 credits selling for $5,000, according to the Motherboard report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGZ9Eb"&gt;The bot has been running since at least January 12, 2021, according to screenshots posted by Gal, but the data it provides access to is from 2019. That’s relatively old, but people don’t change phone numbers that often. It’s especially embarrassing for Facebook as it historically collected phone numbers from people including users who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030068/facebook-friend-suggestions-2fa-security-phone-number-privacy-violation-ftc"&gt;were turning on two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ximEq2"&gt;At the moment it’s unknown if &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; or security researchers have contacted Telegram to try to get the bot taken down, but hopefully it’s something that can be clamped down on soon. That’s not to paint too rosy a picture, though — the data is still out there on the web, and it’s resurfaced a couple of times since it was initially scraped in 2019. I’m just hoping that the easy access will be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
