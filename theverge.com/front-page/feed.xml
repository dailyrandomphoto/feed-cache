    <title>Google will require employees to be vaccinated before returning to offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4D5TFx"&gt;Google will require that employees be vaccinated before they’re allowed to return to the company’s offices, CEO Sundar Pichai announced today in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/business/google-return-to-office-masks.html"&gt;letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9Fc6x"&gt;The announcement marks Google as one of the first major technology companies to require that employees be vaccinated before they return to work. The news comes as part of a new wave of vaccination requirements this week, spurred by the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/27/biden-vaccine-mandate-federal-employees/"&gt;reportedly planning to announce a requirement&lt;/a&gt; for federal workers to either be vaccinated or face frequent testing for COVID-19 sometime on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlp7JB"&gt;Google’s vaccination requirement will reportedly apply to workers at US offices “in the coming weeks” and to other regions “in the coming months,” per the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wuddng"&gt;Additionally, Google will be delaying its official return to offices from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;sometime in September&lt;/a&gt; to October 18th, as the Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to spike across the United States. It joins Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;which also postponed&lt;/a&gt; the end of its remote working policy to “October at the earliest” over similar COVID concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine’s protection against severe disease holds steady over six months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virus Outbreak Palestine" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrpDD2pIQ1PqWanv6Y_41MvsgSs=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645588/1234236839.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kVihci"&gt;The Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine’s protection against severe cases of the disease holds steady after six months, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261159v1.full.pdf"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; released by the companies. But its ability to protect people from developing any symptoms of the disease dropped over time, the analysis showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHWM7e"&gt;The data could add to the debate around if and when people may need booster doses of the vaccines, which the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/24/politics/biden-team-next-steps-on-covid/index.html"&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/07/08/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-vaccine-boosters.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, and other experts have been deliberating on for the past few months. The issue became more pressing when cases of COVID-19 in the United States started to surge as the Delta variant spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPJqwr"&gt;Overall, the vaccine was 91 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 over six months. It was the most protective in the stretch starting seven days after the second dose and running for two months: in that window, it was 96 percent effective. Its&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;efficacy then dropped around 6 percent every two months — to 90 percent between months two and four after vaccination, and to around 84 percent between months four and six after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WupUoV"&gt;There wasn’t a similar drop in efficacy against severe cases of COVID-19 — &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/137926/download"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; as cases where blood oxygen levels drop below 93 percent and heart and respiratory rate are elevated. The vaccine’s efficacy against those severe cases stayed high at 97 percent for the entire six-month stretch after people got their shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpmZmV"&gt;The data was published as a preprint by Pfizer and has not been reviewed by outside scientists. It was released on the day of the company’s earnings call, where it also released &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/pfizer-third-dose-data-bn/index.html"&gt;internal data&lt;/a&gt; showing that a third dose of the vaccine could boost levels of antibodies against the Delta variant of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EaAo4"&gt;The findings came from the study that started last summer to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;first set of findings&lt;/a&gt; from that study were the results the Food and Drug Administration used to authorize the shot. The companies continued to follow the more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;42,000 participants in that study to check how the vaccine performed over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsFiq6"&gt;The analysis also found no new safety concerns in people who had been vaccinated for six months. The company will continue to follow participants for two years after they received the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5Z3pk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>James Bond’s iconic Aston Martin DB5 is coming to Rocket League for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eUfteDturL_q5QqhmYZFMp0sKl8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645507/aston_martin_db5_rocket_league.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nKrrKe"&gt;Would you pay $10 for the privilege of strapping rocket boosters to James Bond’s iconic Aston Martin DB5 automobile and using it to score spectacular gravity-defying goals with a giant ball? &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; is officially making that possible from Thursday, July 29th through August 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqoLEe"&gt;Epic Games developer Psyonix says it’s signed a multiyear deal with MGM and Aston Martin to bring 007 to the vehicular sporting game — starting, of course, with the ‘60s classic made famous by &lt;em&gt;Goldfinger&lt;/em&gt; but still stealing scenes as recently as &lt;em&gt;Skyfall &lt;/em&gt;and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y4uUUp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTkJQh1_yQY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfeOVc"&gt;Will I buy it, though? Nah — because aside from the teaser atop this post, there doesn’t seem to be much Bond about &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s version other than the DB5’s historic association with the franchise. I wasn’t expecting &lt;em&gt;ejector seats&lt;/em&gt;, but Psyonix candidly tells me it won’t have any of the gadgety animations that might set Bond’s version apart. Turning the snazzy secret auto-rotating license plates into a simple door for the rocket engine? I suppose that’s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zP0pGv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10673155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvHszi"&gt;I’ll probably save that money toward &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfLlO7wnwGQ"&gt;Lego’s gadget-filled DB5 model&lt;/a&gt;, while I wax nostalgic over &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/u/1/share/AF1QipPyNibA6GWN90FKru9hLpkgm841a3yi_tblBLxQMXaKbLnStZfJDwWZ6KunTyPt2A?key=ZEc1ajV6d3lXZmRKT2Jlek04OGxhWjhXczE0cjJR"&gt;these photos I took of real Bond cars&lt;/a&gt; at the London Film Museum. I captioned some of those pics &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/my-afternoon-with-james-bonds-amazing-spy-vehicles-1729067561"&gt;for &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you like, though my post there has &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; a few more embedded ads than the last time I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWNvhi"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; DB5 will cost 1,100 credits, or roughly $10. It will come with “007’s Aston Martin DB5 Paint Finish (which resembles the signature Silver Birch color of the Aston Martin), Aston Martin DB5 Engine Audio, Aston Martin DB5 Wheels, and a Reel Life Decal,” according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oppo Watch 2 launches in China with a promise of 16 days of battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOnWiY7jO6LA755kSxuz0Y6ZyrM=/167x0:1526x906/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645503/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_12.38.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N0llrH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oppo.com%2Fcn%2Faccessories%2Foppo-watch-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F28%2F22597727%2Foppo-watch-2-china-announcement-qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oppo Watch 2&lt;/a&gt; has launched in China, featuring the same Apple Watch-style design as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267264/oppo-watch-hands-on-preview-smartwatch-china-apple"&gt;original Oppo Watch&lt;/a&gt; but with improved internal hardware. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 4100 platform&lt;/a&gt; and a promise of up to 16 days of battery life from a single charge while using a low-power mode (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/28/oppo-watch-2-launches-in-china/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3Zd4lp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Oppo Watch isn’t bad, but it does look like an Apple Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267264/oppo-watch-hands-on-preview-smartwatch-china-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CaLCTd"&gt;As was the case for the Chinese model of the original Oppo Watch, the Oppo Watch 2 runs Oppo’s Android-based ColorOS, not Google’s WearOS. Last year’s model was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349246/oppo-watch-global-release-wear-os-india-uk-price-date"&gt;released outside of China&lt;/a&gt; with WearOS and access to the Google Play Store, but Oppo has yet to announce any plans for a broader release at this time. It’s also possible that the company is waiting for Google and Samsung’s upcoming WearOS 3.0 collaboration to arrive later on, seeing as it seems like it’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;difficult to update already released products&lt;/a&gt; to the new operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jrgZlCG05gLl9eOQLnEbFMI9ZYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746021/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_12.38.04_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l8oK7U"&gt;The Oppo Watch 2 will come in 42mm and 46mm sizes, featuring a curved OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and 326ppi. Both models will also feature an optional eSIM, in addition to heart rate, sleep, and blood oxygen monitoring. And the smaller 42mm size will also offer a Bluetooth-only mode, for those who don’t want or need LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wMi1X"&gt;But the most impressive spec on the upcoming smartwatch appears to be the 16-day battery life, although it comes with the caveat of requiring Oppo’s Power Saver mode. In regular use, the Watch 2 can last up to four days on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSPU18"&gt;Preorders for the Oppo Watch 2 are already available in China, with shipping set for August 6th. Pricing starts at ¥1,300 (approximately $200) for the entry-level 42mm Bluetooth model,  ¥1,500 (approximately $231) for the LTE-enabled 42mm model, and ¥2,000 (approximately $308) for the 46mm model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard faces lawsuit and employee backlash over sexual harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xspzYiO45Ozn6ab3B3qlfiIuLs0=/63x0:1065x668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645367/Activision_Blizzard_Merge_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;California’s suit alleges a toxic culture, discrimination, and retaliation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gmgRi2"&gt;Female employees of Activision Blizzard faced “constant sexual harassment” and discrimination based on their gender, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;a lawsuit filed against the company&lt;/a&gt; by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;Some of the claims in the suit&lt;/a&gt; are disturbing enough to require a content warning. Activision Blizzard’s initial official response called the state’s descriptions “distorted, and in many cases false,” though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591611/activision-blizzard-brack-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-california"&gt;one of Blizzard’s executives&lt;/a&gt; has called them “extremely troubling” and Activision Blizzard’s CEO later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;called the company’s first response “tone deaf.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMSnVd"&gt;In response to Activision Blizzard’s denials, what’s estimated to be almost a third of the company’s employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;signed an open letter&lt;/a&gt; calling for Activision Blizzard’s leaders to take accountability, with many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;planning a walkout on July 28th&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;pledged to remove “inappropriate references”&lt;/a&gt; from its MMO &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; but hasn’t specified what those references are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaA27m"&gt;The case, along with employee’s response to it, could end up being an important moment for the video game industry, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;long struggled&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307560/gaming-abuse-harassment-systemic-ubisoft-chris-avellone"&gt;mistreatment of female and minority employees&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Activision Blizzard employees say CEO’s letter ‘fails to address’ key concerns</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EXvj0e"&gt;In a new letter, Activision Blizzard employees said that CEO Bobby Kotick’s note addressing allegations of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination at the company “fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.” Last week, California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;filed a huge lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt; bringing the allegations to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcPsHU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;Staff slammed the company’s initial response to the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and in Wednesday’s response, the employees said they are pleased to see that they have “convinced leadership to change the tone of their communications.” But employees point out that Kotick’s letter does not address some key areas of concern, including ending forced arbitration for all employees and the need for greater pay transparency. We have published the employees’ full response at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvyjQb"&gt;Employees are set to walk out in response to the company’s handling of the allegations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.&lt;/a&gt; Activision Blizzard leadership informed employees Tuesday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;they won’t receive repercussions for attending&lt;/a&gt; and will receive paid time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgF13Y"&gt;Here is the employees’ response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FB3xuI"&gt;On the evening before our employee walkout, Activision Blizzard leadership released a statement apologizing for their harmful responses to last week’s DFEH lawsuit. While we are pleased to see that our collective voices — including an open letter with thousands of signatures from current employees — have convinced leadership to change the tone of their communications, this response fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activision Blizzard’s response did not address the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end of forced arbitration for all employees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worker participation in oversight of hiring and promotion policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The need for greater pay transparency to ensure equality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee selection of a third party to audit HR and other company processes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today’s walkout will demonstrate that this is not a one-time event that our leaders can ignore. We will not return to silence; we will not be placated by the same processes that led us to this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the beginning of an enduring movement in favor of better labor conditions for all employees, especially women, in particular women of color and transgender women, nonbinary people, and other marginalized groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We expect a prompt response and a commitment to action from leadership on the points enumerated above, and look forward to maintaining a constructive dialogue on how to build a better Activision Blizzard for all employees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we stand up for change. Tomorrow and beyond, we will be the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>How to hide Google Meet in Gmail’s desktop app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cw7_wEI5QXwOt5I86upZzZuJTqE=/26x0:1190x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644979/google_meet_poup.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fE7Io9"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;rolled out Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;, a revamped version of its video chatting program Hangouts Meet, in April 2020, and made the app available to anyone with a Google account. You can start or join a Meet videoconference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246277/google-meet-gmail-zoom-hangouts"&gt;right from your Gmail inbox&lt;/a&gt;, using the buttons that Google has placed on the left-hand side of the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6p11d"&gt;But what if you don’t intend to use Meet, or even if you just don’t want it to be there all the time? No worries — you can hide the buttons. (Note: if you’re on a corporate Google Workspace account, you may not be able to change this, depending on your administrator’s settings.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dX319b"&gt;Here’s how to hide Google Meet in Gmail’s desktop app. (You can hide it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363976/google-meet-gmail-tab-how-to-android-ios"&gt;your Android or iOS app as well&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LntVdi"&gt;Open Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3LtBHk"&gt;Click on the cog icon in the top-right corner and on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9hzZkB"&gt;Click on the “Chat and Meet” tab. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9ATF5z"&gt;Next to the “Meet:” label, select “Hide the Meet section in the main menu.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="edpU66"&gt;Click “Save changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can hide the Meet buttons from your Gmail." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I9KE41u2s4w6WZEbut1QdH4Fxdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745689/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_11.19.13_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hide the Meet buttons from your Gmail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tjfSxT"&gt;That’s it! And even if you hide the Meet shortcut in Gmail, you can always access Meet by going to &lt;a href="https://meet.google.com/"&gt;https://meet.google.com/&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKkzCZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 28th, 2021, 11:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on June 4th, 2020;  there have been slight tweaks in the text, and one of the screenshots has been updated to reflect interface changes. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to schedule an email in Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQMLdNDi1A_KbWaYr28CZex_3eY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644775/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y0Dr5D"&gt;Google announced that Gmail would natively support email scheduling in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290065/gmail-scheduling-email-smart-compose-improvements-announced"&gt;April 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the feature became available in desktop and mobile about a month later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSQ1IX"&gt;Previously, you’d have to use a third-party add-on to do this sort of basic scheduling. Thankfully, Gmail’s feature is perfectly easy to use, and it has a range of applications for scheduling work and personal messages. Maybe you’re trying to talk to someone in a different time zone, nag someone about an event, or you just want to remind your future self about something. If so, schedule an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsLwGC"&gt;To schedule a message via Gmail in a desktop web browser, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yoJaCx"&gt;Compose a new email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Vg9cOH"&gt;Click the triangle next to the blue “Send” button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6htd1B"&gt;Select one of the suggested times, or click “Pick date &amp;amp; time” to customize when exactly you want the message to go out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uWPybc"&gt;Click “Schedule send” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="oWw3JT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:6246071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfucdK"&gt;The process is exactly the same in Gmail’s mobile app. But instead of clicking part of the send button, when composing an email, you have to click the three dots in the top right-hand corner of the screen. That’ll bring up the option to schedule a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3EgNaz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10673600"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hgEbEO"&gt;Finding scheduled emails and canceling them is also easy. There’s a new “Scheduled” folder in desktop and mobile. Simply click on a message in the folder and click “Cancel send” in the top right of the window to stop a message from being sent. It’ll go right back to your drafts folder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTEa0S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 28th, 2021, 10:40AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on May 6th, 2019; there are a few minor tweaks in the introduction, and some of the screenshots have been replaced to reflect changes in Gmail’s interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8uj1f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoWHqy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google shows off Play Store’s upcoming data privacy section</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pqe3zVNeBdGprt5iHtRg0ne5lr8=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644728/Untitled__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The section gives a summary of data collected, and security practices.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yjhP1v"&gt;Google has revealed an in-progress design for the Play Store’s upcoming safety section, which will provide information about an app’s data collection, privacy, and security practices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422894/google-play-app-privacy-info-apple-app-store-labels"&gt;Announced in May&lt;/a&gt;, developers will be able to start declaring their safety info in October until a deadline of April next year. The safety section is currently due to start appearing in app descriptions in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeKSLI"&gt;Although Google says the design is subject to change, screenshots released today show the safety section sitting above a listing’s existing Ratings &amp;amp; reviews section. It offers a summary of an app’s data privacy features, including the types of data collected and whether data is encrypted. There’s also a “See details” option to get more specifics on what collected data is used for, and whether the collection is essential for using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yD2xZoMs93pnuF_1K2vYbXyVxxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745164/Untitled__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapping “See details” provides more info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pg4HSG"&gt;The section allows developers to “give a user deeper insight into their privacy and security practices, as well as explain the data the app may collect and why — all before a user installs the app,” Google says. If developers haven’t provided the information by the time the section starts appearing, a “No information available” message will appear in its place in the listing. Eventually, apps that don’t provide the information could see their updates blocked, Google has previously said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVrM5K"&gt;Google’s safety section — which will be required by all third-party and first-party Google apps — follows the introduction of very similar “privacy labels” to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; last year. Like Google’s section, Apple’s labels are designed to offer more transparency about user data collection, including whether it’s used to track users or is personally identifiable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTsll1Y2zfwiYjuC7dYznEpe6iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745165/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An updated timeframe for the introduction of the feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ7FgO"&gt;Apple and Google’s initiatives have arrived as their respective &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;stores&lt;/a&gt; are facing intense antitrust scrutiny over concerns they give the two companies too much control over their respective mobile ecosystems. A core part of Apple and Google’s arguments is that their stores help keep mobile users safe. New initiatives like privacy labels and safety sections seem like an attempt to bolster these arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bKyGk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtG2oS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter pilots a new shopping section for brands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ve41m-H8BLDVQ3XDb5yADnH3rv4=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69644730/Shop_Module_Hero_23July.001__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop and Arden Cove are two of the brands piloting the feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3YKwAD"&gt;Twitter is piloting a new feature that allows businesses to add a shopping section to the top of their profiles, the company has announced. The Shop Module launches in the US today and offers a carousel of products for visitors to browse. Tapping a product will link to a listing with the option of making a purchase without ever leaving Twitter. The pilot is currently limited to iOS devices for people who use the service in English, Twitter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIhHzi"&gt;“People talk about products on Twitter everyday, so we’re excited about how this early exploration of the Shop Module can build a bridge between people talking about and discovering products on Twitter to actually purchasing them,” Twitter says. The pilot is only available with a small number of brands for now, including GameStop, Arden Cove, and around ten others. Twitter did not reveal a timeline for when it might expand to more brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmxUyhg6fHdAKn-pox2jwU-lyok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745182/Arden_Cove_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The module consists of a carousel with links to product listings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G5Vf1j"&gt;Other social media platforms including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399858/facebook-shop-app-update-sell-product-instagram"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326120/instagram-shopping-facebook-pay-shop-app"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163106/whatsapp-carts-feature-shopping-in-app-ecommerce"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594636/pinterest-idea-pins-tag-product-brand-shoppable"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; have also used new features to turn their services into shopping destinations, and even Twitter has previously experimented with embedding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/8/6120079/twitter-commerce-buy-button"&gt;“Buy” button directly into tweets&lt;/a&gt; (it &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/1/18/14311230/twitter-buy-button-dead-killed-shuts-down"&gt;officially dropped the feature in 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5vvut"&gt;The Shop Module pilot comes as Twitter is exploring ways of making money beyond showing ads. In this year alone, Twitter has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;paid subscription service&lt;/a&gt; with access to premium features, as well as plans to let users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545167/twitter-opens-super-follows-ticketed-spaces-new-feature-test-application-ios-android"&gt;charge for access to exclusive content&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; for one-off payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ9b37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EIlvD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
