    <title>EU proposals could give millions of gig workers employment rights</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WnCQnU"&gt;The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has put forward a series of proposals that could lead to millions of gig workers across the bloc getting similar legal protections to traditional employees. In a &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6605"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Commission says these rights would include a minimum wage (where applicable), collective bargaining, paid leave, unemployment and sickness benefits, and pensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMyAGO"&gt;The Commission says an estimated 28 million people in the EU currently work through “digital labor platforms,” and of these, as many as 5.5 million may be incorrectly classified as being self-employed. So, with its new rules, the EU wants to lay out a series of criteria that will clearly determine whether a platform is a simple intermediary or an “employer” with more obligations to its “workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8AZM8Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Uber are expected to lobby against the rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2PRq8s"&gt;The legal status of gig workers has become an increasingly contentious issue around the world. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/technology/gig-workers-europe-uber.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that taxi companies like Uber and food delivery services like Deliveroo have been accused of categorizing their workers as independent contractors to save costs and reduce legal liabilities. If adopted, the EU’s new gig economy rules could be some of the strictest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBhSm7"&gt;Individual countries have already attempted to push back on these categorizations. A legal ruling in the UK in February stated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/21330906/uber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights"&gt;Uber’s drivers are workers&lt;/a&gt;, and the following month the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;company started offering a minimum wage and paid vacation&lt;/a&gt;. Uber opposes the Commission’s new proposal, telling the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll result in higher costs for customers, putting jobs at risk. (Though, for what it’s worth, the company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-fares-double-small-cities-if-voters-reject-prop-22-2020-10#:~:text=%22The%20vast%20majority%20of%20our,on%20what%20city%20you%20are.%22"&gt;made the same argument when California&lt;/a&gt; was debating the issue of worker protections. When the company got its way, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike"&gt;raised prices anyway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDys6M"&gt;Alongside its new proposals around employment status, the Commission also wants to increase transparency around the management of employees via algorithm, including the right for workers to contest automated decisions. The proposals also include new obligations for platforms to provide data to national authorities, as well as guidelines clarifying the rights of self-employed people to collective bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sH6xjx"&gt;“Our proposal for a Directive will help false self-employed working for platforms to correctly determine their employment status and enjoy all the social rights that come with that,” the EU’s Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said. “Genuine self-employed on platforms will be protected through enhanced legal certainty on their status and there will be new safeguards against the pitfalls of algorithmic management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPNgug"&gt;The Commission’s proposals will now be debated by the European Parliament and Council. The directive would then need to be adopted into law by individual member states. Given the timescales involved in both these processes, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that the rules are unlikely to become law before 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Winning the war on ransomware</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The DOJ’s task force is changing the landscape around hackers, but will it be enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7G6qma"&gt;In the past 10 years, ransomware has become inescapable. All kinds of institutions have been targeted, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667637/go-read-this-ransomware-attacks-schools-student-identity-theft"&gt;schools children go to&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776561/hosptial-cyberattack-ransomware-risk"&gt;medical infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;report from the US Treasury estimates&lt;/a&gt; there were over half a billion dollars in ransomware payouts in the first half of 2021 alone. Law enforcement has struggled to get a handle on the situation, with many groups operating for years with no apparent fear of repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99EgLA"&gt;This year, federal law enforcement decided to try something new. In April, the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-targeted-by-new-justice-department-task-force-11619014158"&gt;created the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force&lt;/a&gt; in a move to prioritize the “disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity.” The task force is supposed to help share information between DOJ departments, as well as work with outside and foreign agencies. In the months since, it’s made some impressive prosecutions, but they’re just a sliver of the overall  — and the bigger picture remains maddeningly unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="G0OW9I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ttj2fT"&gt;One of the first publicized wins for the group came in June, when the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization"&gt;Department of Justice said&lt;/a&gt; the group was handling the case of an individual alleged to be partially responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/trickbot-not-your-average-hat-trick-a-malware-with-multiple-hats/"&gt;the malware suite known as Trickbot&lt;/a&gt;, which could help expose a system to a ransomware attack. Days after that announcement came an even bigger win: &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside"&gt;the DOJ announced&lt;/a&gt; it had seized back $2.3 million of the $4.4 million ransom paid by oil company Colonial Pipeline, and that the task force had coordinated the efforts. Then, in October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770701/revil-ransomware-arrest-kaseya-crypto-europol-cybersecurity"&gt;its biggest win yet&lt;/a&gt; — the arrests of a few alleged members of REvil, a hacking group, by European police forces, and the seizure of over $6 million in funds the department says were linked to ransomware payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQkPo7"&gt;Still, the sheer volume of attacks means a handful of prosecutions is unlikely to make a difference. Prosecutors need the threat of law enforcement action to scare criminals away from ransomware — and some experts say the scheme is still too lucrative for criminals to give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BREgzz"&gt;Hackers “prefer to take the risk instead of leaving this lucrative malicious activity behind,” according to Dmitry Bestuzhev, a researcher at cybersecurity company Kaspersky. “So what they try to do is to learn from others’ mistakes and improve their opsec, but there is no evidence they feel intimidated and want to quit.” Bestuzhev says they’ll continue to re-form groups, even as the government works to shut them down — “even with the successful arrest we have recently witnessed, many ransomware groups are just here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKEDHx"&gt;But not everyone agrees with Bestuzhev. John Fokker, the head of cyber investigations for McAfee Enterprise Advanced Threat Research, is more optimistic that the task force is starting to change the outlook for criminals. For years ransomware “had been relatively untouched,” not getting too much attention from governments, Fokker told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Now that the task force was starting to crack down, he says, “what used to be a safe space isn’t a safe space anymore. There’s beginning to be an atmosphere of distrust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="kBBYxO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s beginning to be an atmosphere of distrust”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgNZD9"&gt;The attention from the task force has also been affecting ransomware groups’ ability to advertise to potential customers, the ones who often use their malware to infect targets. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com%2Fblogs%2Fenterprise%2Fmcafee-enterprise-atr%2Fwho-will-bend-the-knee-in-raas-game-of-thrones-in-2022%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22822884%2Fus-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a blog&lt;/a&gt;, Fokker discussed how cybercrime forums have become hesitant to play host to ransomware operators, banning them from advertising in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline attacks. Forum administrators, when they offered an explanation for the decision, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/three-major-hacking-forums-ban-ransomware-ads-as-some-ransomware-gangs-shut-down/"&gt;said that ransomware was attracting a lot of unwanted attention&lt;/a&gt; — as one admin put it, according to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;, the word “ransom” was now associated with “unpleasant phenomena — geopolitics, extortion, government hacking.” Another forum had a cheekier explanation for why it was banning posts about ransomware: “if it ran somewhere, then you should probably go catch it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRg7Jy"&gt;The ability to advertise on forums cut off the groups’ easy access to customers, made it harder for ransomware creators to get in touch with the affiliates making them billions of dollars, and made the contact that does happen riskier on both sides. Transferring money or giving demos becomes harder when there’s not a (somewhat) trusted third-party platform to help mediate. That, along with bounties for up to $10 million, has started to create “little cracks in the model,” says Fokker. He even mentioned an instance where an affiliate, angry with what they considered to be a meager payout, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/angry-conti-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-gangs-attack-playbook/"&gt;posted a ransomware group’s entire playbook&lt;/a&gt;. “That kind of environment hurts business,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hFl5IC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re taking the fight to the bad guys”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDWaWh"&gt;The task force has also been helping the people on the other side of ransomware: the companies and organizations that are targeted by it. Government agencies have been working together to keep industries informed about what actions they’ve taken against ransomware operators, and to issue guidance to help keep companies safe. ”The Department of Commerce, Department of Treasury, State, Homeland Security, and Defense, all of them have taken a very clear, concrete action on ransomware actors to disrupt and each of them have their own press release and their own guidance,” says Vishaal Hariprasad, CEO of cyber-focused insurance company Resilience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiU4DH"&gt;When asked to grade the government’s actions, he says, “I would actually give the government an A for what they’ve done in the past 90 days. I think it’s been pretty incredible to see that we’re actually taking action, we’re taking the fight to the bad guys with disruption, with arrests, with warrants, sanctions, the $10 million bounty for any information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6hY3p"&gt;Hariprasad says while the government had carried out similar actions in years prior, the publicity was a boon to victims. “I think the task force has helped coordinate it, but coordinating in the back end where nobody can see isn’t valuable. It doesn’t have the motivating psychological impact unless you can talk about it ... the government’s always been doing things, it’s just never been able to publicly talk about it in a clear and concise, coordinated way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dDdpeB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A big part of deterrence is making sure they understand that there are repercussions to their actions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I40BhI"&gt;Still others are optimistic that the task force can have an impact if it keeps up its legal actions. “As long as there is a sustained effort against these somewhat decentralized and shifting crime gangs; this isn’t just ‘whack-a-mole,’” says Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky, echoing Fokker’s optimism. “While we are seeing the resurrection of certain parts of the ransomware-as-a-service chain in response,” Baumgartner thinks the “coordinated anti-ransomware efforts are just the start. It is great to see evidence of some ransom payments clawed back, decryption keys obtained, communications infiltrated, successful multi-national law enforcement efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXie3u"&gt;In particular, Hariprasad thinks massively disruptive attacks could become less frequent. “I think you’ll still have the one or two major coordinated campaigns that will be very sophisticated,” he says. “But as they get a lot of attention and people start focusing on them, you’ll see that happen less, and the younger or the less sophisticated operators will continue to get back to the lower end of the ransoms and just kind of go for quantity over quality.” Better to collect a few $50,000 ransoms without making headlines, the thinking goes, than to bag $40 million and have law enforcement kicking down your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLFKry"&gt;It’s hard to say which of the task force’s tactics will end up having the greatest effect, and there’s always the possibility that things get worse before they get better. If ransomware operators wind up desperate, they could end up going after a massive target, in a Hollywood-style “one last job” scenario. Ransomware could also become a more manageable annoyance, as hackers look for the next big cash cow, one that the world’s governments aren’t paying as much attention to. Or attackers could get creative and start developing entirely new ways to make trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BDPV0d"&gt;Cybersecurity is always a cat-and-mouse game, and the incentives to hack big companies won’t be going away — but as Hariprasad told me, “a big part of deterrence is making sure they understand that there are repercussions to their actions and that the government is actively doing something.” On that point, at least, governments seem to be making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes was always in control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nh50hlgygpiFOkywqW0dX0l-LSU=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248958/VRG_ILLO_4914_Holmes_Trial.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Joseph Gough&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;All the queen’s men&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="C898gH"&gt;Control and image are important to Elizabeth Holmes. They were important to the PR effort around Theranos when she was portrayed as the second coming of Steve Jobs. They were important when she delegated reprimands to maintain her friendly image. And they are important now — as a jury is about to decide whether she’s guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFHG3a"&gt;Since September, she’s walked to the courthouse holding hands with someone — usually her mother. I have watched Holmes sit bolt upright at the defense table as her lawyers slowly wilt. She’s dressed in business attire — sheath dresses with structured blazers or skirt suits. Sensible kitten heels. A coterie of expensive blondes and men in fancy loafers have &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/elizabeth-holmes-relies-on-entourage-of-friends-as-theranos-trial-nears-end.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.PostToTwitter"&gt;filled her side of the courtroom&lt;/a&gt;, especially as she has testified. (Occasionally, there is even a brunette.) Holmes is presenting an image of herself as a former CEO, surrounded by friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNnN0B"&gt;Holmes testified for seven days, and then the defense rested its case. (Closing arguments will take place next week.) She was one of only three witnesses her lawyers called to rebut the prosecution’s case — and by far the most significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ec4dI1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The trial showcased her employees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vjWYNe"&gt;The government called 29 witnesses in an attempt to show Holmes knowingly deceived investors and patients. The prosecution’s case showcased her employees, many of whom had quit because they were uncomfortable with what Theranos was doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="se8RjT"&gt;Perhaps because the defense kept him on the stand so long, when I think of the archetypal Theranos employee, I think of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;Adam Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt;, the former lab director. He started at Theranos excited about what it was trying to accomplish and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22705156/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-aging-the-case-rosendorff"&gt;left miserable&lt;/a&gt;. Rosendorff &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; Theranos VP Daniel Young — when he said Young’s name, his voice dripped with scorn. He was openly contemptuous of former Theranos president Sunny Balwani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3oQMV"&gt;Rosendorff didn’t sound like he hated Elizabeth Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfsHU7"&gt;During his testimony, he was shown an email wherein Holmes’ brother, Christian, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699614/elizabeth-holmes-trial-steve-jobs-emails"&gt;scolded Rosendorff for refusing to defend a bad test result&lt;/a&gt;. Then, as we all in the courtroom watched, Rosendorff was shown Christian had forwarded the email to his sister. &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%204323/Trial%20Exh.%204323%20Email.pdf"&gt;In reply to Christian&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes wrote, “You handled this excellently.” When Rosendorff read this in court, apparently seeing it for the first time, his face fell. The email hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qktpz"&gt;Something similar happened with Tyler Shultz, another Theranos whistleblower. When Shultz took his concerns about Theranos’ methods to Holmes, Balwani’s response was &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%201675/Trial%20Exh.%201675%20Email.pdf"&gt;nasty&lt;/a&gt;. In the email, Balwani complained about Shultz’s “arrogant and patronizing tone and reckless comments” before proceeding to insult his understanding of statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnjBj3"&gt;But Balwani wasn’t acting alone. He’d drafted the email before he sent it and shared it with Holmes, &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205645/Trial%20Exh.%205645%20Email.pdf"&gt;who made edits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FpKlAA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Her manners have been impeccable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5F5KB"&gt;Holmes clearly wanted to be liked, so at Theranos, she let others handle rebukes. This is not unusual. Jimmy Page ran Led Zeppelin, make no mistake — but he didn’t do the yelling to keep people in line. He had &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/11/26/led-zeppelin-peter-grant-manager"&gt;Peter Grant, Zeppelin’s manager&lt;/a&gt;, do that. (Kurt Cobain &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Come_as_You_are/ZEI_X-bDWQwC?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;bsq=%22people%20who%20are%20quiet%20are%20not%20necessarily%20passive%22"&gt;sometimes deployed Courtney Love&lt;/a&gt; in a similar fashion.) A lot of hierarchical organizations are run this way, including corporations and monarchies, allowing the leader to maintain a pristine image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3Vqnn"&gt;Holmes has sought to carry such an image — six years after the first &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article exposed the reality at Theranos — into the courtroom. Throughout her time on the stand, Holmes focused primarily on whatever lawyer was talking to her. She listened attentively. When she fumbled with an exhibit or was confused, she apologized, smiling. In the small interactions I had with her outside the courtroom — there is only one women’s room — her manners have been impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="W1oAkh"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rWt7ha"&gt;Central to the trial is the question of how much Holmes knew. For her to be guilty of fraud, she had to have the intent to deceive. Intent is difficult to prove. Holmes’ defense argued in its opening statements the picture is more complicated than what the prosecution has put forward. The defense has suggested that most of the blame should fall on the shoulders of Theranos’ lab directors and on Balwani. That Holmes didn’t know about the problems in-depth. She thought she was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bd1RJc"&gt;To emphasize this, the defense had Holmes testify to how what the investors heard was &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; true — so maybe the investors had just misunderstood. “I wanted to convey the impact the company could make for people and for healthcare,” Holmes said. “I talked about what we created and what it could do, what was possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytlVjR"&gt;Theranos worked with pharma companies, even if drugmakers such as Pfizer and Schering-Plough didn’t independently validate Theranos’ tech, as investors said Holmes claimed. Holmes said she put the drug companies’ logos on documents she gave to investors and business partners to represent the partnership — not to fool anyone. She couldn’t, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22811246/elizabeth-holmes-texts-control-theranos-money"&gt;explain away other changes&lt;/a&gt; she made to those documents that presented Theranos in a better light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQFn2W"&gt;Theranos did one study with a US Army burn unit. It had started paperwork for other military studies — but didn’t deploy in Iraq, Afghanistan, or on military helicopters. But investors said Holmes told them that the company’s devices &lt;em&gt;were &lt;/em&gt;used in Afghanistan and on medevacs. “I don’t think I said that,” Holmes said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823361/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial-cross-examination"&gt;during her cross-examination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKqW2Z"&gt;Holmes claimed she didn’t tell Theranos investors about the company’s modifications to commercially available machines because she wanted to protect trade secrets. But she could have told Walgreens, because it was a business partner that had a confidentiality agreement in place, the prosecution pointed out, &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%2015055/Trial%20Exh.%2015055%20Email.pdf"&gt;citing a document&lt;/a&gt; her own lawyers had created about trade secrets at Theranos. Certainly Holmes could have chosen to correct the glowing &lt;em&gt;Fortune &lt;/em&gt;article that said Theranos only used its own devices. She did not. Instead, Theranos’ investor relations team sent it to her investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="HnXsWV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes is testifying because it is the only way she can assert control over the trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqk0og"&gt;Two claims stuck out as being in the realm of pure fantasy: the number of tests Theranos could perform on its own equipment and its financial projections. To counter those, the defense showed evidence that Theranos was &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; on a device that &lt;em&gt;might have been&lt;/em&gt; capable of running all the tests Theranos wanted to run at some point in the future. It also tried to pin the financial projections squarely on Balwani alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Zknkj"&gt;The court heard remarkably consistent testimony from multiple investors. The jury heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;audio recordings&lt;/a&gt; of Holmes &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/GSUG1tVJYnf6A45BwOVI"&gt;lying confidently&lt;/a&gt;. Jurors also saw video evidence — most recently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGfaJZAdfNE"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Mad Money&lt;/em&gt; segment&lt;/a&gt; — of Holmes’ dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMJXkY"&gt;To make sure those recordings weren’t the only way the jury heard her voice, Holmes testified in her own defense. I have seen speculation that she did this because she is a master persuader. I don’t think that’s quite right — not least because Holmes wasn’t persuasive when she was unrehearsed. Holmes testified because it was the only way she could assert control over the trial, just as she made a point of controlling prospective investors’ &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%202065/Trial%20Exh.%202065%20Email.pdf"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823361/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial-cross-examination"&gt;s of Theranos tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZHeMF"&gt;In her direct testimony, I saw only a glimmer of the charmer I’d been promised. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22792606/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-witness-stand-surprise"&gt;first day she was on the stand&lt;/a&gt;, I thought we’d get a &lt;em&gt;tour de force&lt;/em&gt;. She was smiling, confident, relaxed. The early days of Theranos were happy memories for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DyE3Ka"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The net effect was of watching someone realize in real time exactly how strong the case against her was &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocsq9a"&gt;When she was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799756/elizabeth-holmes-pfizer-logo-confession"&gt;asked about the testimony she’d heard in the trial&lt;/a&gt;, she seemed to get increasingly nervous — and her strategy of blaming others for Theranos’ problems didn’t feel especially compelling. The net effect was of watching someone realize in real time exactly how strong the case against her was and how weak her explanation sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgCvR2"&gt;Frequently, when she was cross-examined, Holmes told the court &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823361/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial-cross-examination"&gt;she didn’t recall&lt;/a&gt; a conversation, text, or email. Sometimes this sounded flimsy — but sometimes it sounded like a natural response to being asked questions about events and conversations that took place more than five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuuoSl"&gt;On the final day of her direct testimony, Holmes pivoted from distancing herself from Theranos’ operations. She said that she’d been raped at Stanford, and it was part of why she’d dropped out. Her face turned pink; she almost sobbed. This was the beginning of Holmes trying to change the narrative that the prosecution had presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj0GzB"&gt;The Stanford incident wasn’t part of Theranos’ official founding lore. She wasn’t just starting a company — she couldn’t stand to be at Stanford anymore. “I decided I was going to build a life by building this company,” she said. Building a new company also meant building a new identity: a founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="d6rIJz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You are the company,” Balwani texted Holmes in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTh9So"&gt;That made a few other things click into place. &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205704/Trial%20Exh.%205704%20Email.pdf"&gt;Emailing Rupert Murdoch,&lt;/a&gt; the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal,&lt;/em&gt; to try to kill John Carreyrou’s story wasn’t &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;extreme. But hiring private investigators and Fusion GPS to harass Carreyrou and his sources was unusual. Once she admitted the company was about building a new identity, it made more sense. (“You are the company,” &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387G/Trial%20Exh.%205387G%20Text.pdf"&gt;Balwani texted Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.) It wasn’t just that Carreyrou was exposing Theranos — he was ripping away part of her very self&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZZ7ta"&gt;In one exchange, prosecutors made this connection explicit. According to a set of notes Holmes said she took while Balwani raged at her, he said, “I don’t enjoy being in a company that’s not going to win... fucking mediocre quality of this piece of shit company.” Prosecutor Robert Leach asked Holmes if that was Balwani telling her about the problems with the company. Holmes replied, “He’s telling me about problems with me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfWSUR"&gt;Her performance on the stand when she talked about Balwani was compelling. Certainly the jurors were rapt. Holmes also had some contemporaneous documents to support her allegations: a &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207734/Trial%20Exh.%207734%20Notes.pdf"&gt;handwritten memo by Balwani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207534/Trial%20Exh.%207534%20Notes.pdf"&gt;her notes as he talked&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387F/Trial%20Exh.%205387F%20Text%20Messages.pdf"&gt;some text messages&lt;/a&gt;, including one where Balwani said, “I have molded you,” and chastised her for speaking in her “giddy” voice. She also testified that Balwani didn’t tell her to lie to investors, business partners, or the press. Instead, she said, “He impacted everything about who I was, and I don’t fully understand that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAoOEL"&gt;The prosecution responded by presenting texts where Balwani deferred to her or where Holmes overruled him. In &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387B/Trial%20Exh.%205387B%20Texts.pdf"&gt;a message from April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Balwani wrote to Holmes, “I am worried about overexposure without solid substance.” Holmes replied, “That media is why we are getting Americare,” an insurance company. (Presumably, there was some kind of deal, but more details weren’t offered in court.) She went on to suggest using the media to “drown out and refute the crap.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="vwtdOn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It is hard to say what happened in Balwani and Holmes’ private relationship, not least because it was secret&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3m64Mg"&gt;In July 2015, Balwani again objected to Holmes’ PR strategy, something he’d deferred to her on: “I do dislike the direction u have taken with all this PR and all legal work.” He even offered to leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5smgj"&gt;And after seeing Holmes speak at a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/elizabeth-holmes-discusses-theranos-at-wsjdlive-2015/20CE68A0-CAEE-48E0-BAB4-FD6C47D283BE.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, Balwani wrote, “Worried about your ‘all fingersticks on our technology’ comment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mS5TU1"&gt;It is hard to say what happened in Balwani and Holmes’ private relationship, not least because it was secret. But the texts where Balwani protested Holmes’ strategies show that he didn’t call &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the shots at Theranos. In some of the documents we saw, when Balwani laid into someone, it was because Holmes had encouraged it. In the business relationship, she appeared to be the dominant partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwjfeq"&gt;The evidence also pointed to Holmes’ need for control. Press strategies are about control — Holmes even dictated &lt;em&gt;Fortune &lt;/em&gt;journalist &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;Roger Parloff’s word choice&lt;/a&gt;. The defense has noted multiple times that Holmes never sold a share of her Theranos stock; she also lost everything she’d invested. The defense pointed to this as proof she believed in Theranos’ tech. Well, maybe. But she was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/8W5FAVfMOfNalo3tYR10"&gt;also making a salary of $400,000 a year in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. What would she need to sell her stock for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4uovh"&gt;Founding a company, being its CEO, and owning the majority of its stock (with super-voting rights, no less) put her in total control. She could have, as she admitted on cross-examination, fired the entire board of directors if she wanted. Her testimony about abuse was aimed at obscuring that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZAyo0"&gt;Domestic abuse can warp a person’s self-image. But this isn’t a domestic abuse trial, and we have only tiny glimpses of what went on in Holmes’ and Balwani’s relationship. The jury may also be instructed to disregard it. Once the defense had rested, prosecutors told Judge Edward Davila to expect a filing to strike Holmes’ abuse testimony from the record. (The gist: without an expert witness to put that testimony in context, it is irrelevant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEWKOF"&gt;Even if they are told not to consider it, the jury still &lt;em&gt;heard &lt;/em&gt;those allegations. But the image Holmes presented of herself in that testimony — thoroughly under Balwani’s control, down to the last details of what she ate and who she saw  — ran counter to the image she projected, down to her posture: &lt;em&gt;immaculate&lt;/em&gt; self-control, a leader. That image is a lot closer to the person we saw calling the shots in their texts and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;sending subordinates emails at 1AM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5gXCgc"&gt;The question is whether the jury will notice that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft tempts software pirates with 50 percent discount on Office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIwpP_9lPmcvzKD3edaeIw9xQ9Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248712/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31Wchq"&gt;In a bold bid to turn digital crooks away from a life of crime, Microsoft is offering a 50 percent discount on its Office suite to some people using pirated versions. &lt;a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/12/03/pirated-versions-of-office-are-getting-a-discount-offer-for-a-microsoft-365-subscription/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghacks &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that a new message in the Office ribbon bar is appearing on pirated Office apps, tempting people with a 50 percent discount on a genuine Microsoft 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHxaWg"&gt;The message links to an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fbuy%2Fget-genuine-b%3Focid%3Dprod_unlicensed_cons_fuel_acq_getgenuine50_buy%26rtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official Microsoft website&lt;/a&gt; that claims “pirated software exposes your PC to security threats.” Microsoft warns Office pirates that they run the risk of running into viruses, malware, data loss, identify theft, and the inability to receive critical updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uw3INNGnDbIpxTMYywVAmk0sxrc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075428/officepiratednotification.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ghacks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 50 percent discount notification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m33Z85"&gt;The discount brings the price of a Microsoft 365 Family subscription down to just $49.99 for the first year, or $34.99 for a year of Microsoft 365 Personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoBoMn"&gt;Microsoft has used “get genuine Office” banners in its productivity suite for years, but it’s rare to see the software maker offer big discounts to convert pirates into paid customers. There doesn’t appear to be a discount for the perpetual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704168/microsoft-office-2021-features-pricing-release-date"&gt;$149.99 Office 2021 version&lt;/a&gt;, either. Like the rest of us, pirates are being persuaded to move to Office subscriptions instead, as Microsoft seeks to boost its subscriber numbers way beyond 50 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp launches cryptocurrency payments pilot in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMeRn7jtTHoSnUs2kV9iQEvnHN8=/0x0:1683x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248672/FGHzidMVcAEqPAY.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bX9D7N"&gt;WhatsApp has launched a new pilot that lets a “limited number” of people in the US send and receive money from within a chat using cryptocurrency. The feature is powered by Novi, Meta’s digital wallet that launched as a pilot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734487/facebook-novi-digital-wallet-pilot-program-payments-diem-cryptocurrency"&gt;six weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, with payments made using &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/paxos-renames-its-stablecoin-from-pax-to-usdp/#:~:text=Paxos%20Standard%20is%20now%20Pax,remains%20fundamentally%20identical%20to%20PAX.&amp;amp;text=Sending%20money%20is%20as%20easy,from%20one%20wallet%20to%20another."&gt;Pax Dollars (USDP)&lt;/a&gt;, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar issued by Paxos. The news was announced by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/skasriel/status/1468722859648307201"&gt;Novi’s incoming head Stephane Kasriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1468724981886427138"&gt;WhatsApp’s Will Cathcart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzA14T"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.novi.com/WhatsApp"&gt;Novi’s website&lt;/a&gt;, sending a payment works much like sending any other attachment in WhatsApp. You access the feature via the paper clip icon on Android or the + icon on iOS, and then select “Payment” from the menu that appears. Novi’s site notes there are no fees for sending or receiving money, no limits on how often payments can be sent, and no fees to keep a balance in your Novi account or to withdraw it to your bank account. Payments are transferred instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w20vbf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There's a new way to try the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/novi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Novi&lt;/a&gt; digital wallet. Starting today, a limited number of people in the US will be able to send and receive money using Novi on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, making sending money to family and friends as easy as sending a message.    &lt;a href="https://t.co/dGz3lejri7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dGz3lejri7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stephane Kasriel (@skasriel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/skasriel/status/1468722859648307201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZU3Qh"&gt;The Novi pilot was originally available in the US and Guatemala, but &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-announcing-the-novi-pilot-program-in-the-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that users in Guatemala won’t be able to access the new WhatsApp payments functionality. Instead, they’ll have to continue using the standalone Novi app. Payments do not affect WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption, which is in place by default for all personal conversations. The WhatsApp Novi pilot is available in both English and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLL5UQ"&gt;The new pilot has its roots in Facebook’s (now Meta’s) much-hyped cryptocurrency plans, which were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18716326/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-blockchain-irs-starbucks"&gt;officially announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Facebook (as part of the Libra Association) planned to develop and launch a cryptocurrency called Libra, which would be pegged to a basket of low-volatility assets rather than any one specific currency. This would integrate with a Facebook-developed digital wallet called Calibra. The whole system was designed to offer a way to send money around the world with lower fees than traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWVENu"&gt;These plans have shifted considerably since then. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755078/libra-diem-name-change-cryptocurrency-facebook"&gt;Libra has become Diem&lt;/a&gt;, the Libra Association has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910330/mastercard-stripe-ebay-facebook-libra-association-withdrawal-cryptocurrency"&gt;lost several of its most high profile members&lt;/a&gt; and become the Diem Association, and Calibra has become Novi. Perhaps most notably, Novi has ended up launching without the Diem cryptocurrency. Instead, Pax Dollars are the work of a separate company &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_Trust_Company"&gt;called Paxos&lt;/a&gt;, and Meta is relying on cryptocurrency exchange &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-power-crypto-custody-for-facebooks-novi-90dc8d3f5830"&gt;Coinbase as its custody partner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtSlFm"&gt;Meta’s then head of Novi David Marcus said that the company is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447443250728962"&gt;still committed to Diem&lt;/a&gt; when he announced the launch of the Novi pilot in October. “We intend to launch Novi with Diem once it receives regulatory approval,” Marcus tweeted. David Marcus subsequently said he was leaving the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810220/facebook-crypto-david-marcus-novi-diem-meta"&gt;at the end of the year&lt;/a&gt;. He has called the pilot of Novi in WhatsApp “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1468716985789796354"&gt;the best farewell gift from the best team ever!&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ4ain"&gt;While WhatsApp’s US payment plans revolve around Novi and cryptocurrency, elsewhere in the world it’s already offering payments using traditional fiat currencies. The feature got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552325/whatsapp-payment-service-india-launches-regulatory-approval-upi-graded-ncpi"&gt;widespread rollout in India last year&lt;/a&gt;, and has also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22420029/whatsapp-payments-brazil-launch-regulations-fight"&gt; launched in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gxp9BgylMQ3qS-5SJ0SFaj7ibvA=/0x1:3008x2006/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248660/Weather_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The weather widget returns to the taskbar.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="neQ2k1"&gt;Microsoft is bringing back its weather widget on the Windows 11 taskbar. It’s a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217153/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature"&gt;originally debuted in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, providing live weather conditions and quick access to the broader widget and news feed. Windows 11 removed this taskbar integration in favor of a separate widgets panel, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmjjHm"&gt;“We are trying out showing the Widgets entry point on the left side of your taskbar with live weather content,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/12/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22518/"&gt;explains Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s Windows Insider chief. “You can also open the Widgets board by simply hovering over the entry point.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2pgreh8hWL46VtI2C26KpXcrPZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075416/Taskbar.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The weather widget will appear as an icon on left-aligned taskbars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fxnMVi"&gt;The weather widget will be displayed on the left side of the taskbar by default, or as an additional icon if you have your Windows 11 taskbar aligned to the left. This latest taskbar change, available in the Windows 11 Dev Channel, follows the ability for testers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812258/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-clock-multiple-monitors-start-menu-updates"&gt;display the time and date across multiple monitors&lt;/a&gt;. Both changes are expected to rollout in a Windows 11 update in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5WSBr"&gt;Alongside the taskbar changes, Microsoft is also announcing a new Voice Access feature for Windows 11. “Voice access is a new experience that enables everyone, including people with mobility disabilities, to control their PC and author text using their voice,” says Langowski.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KKuD52SySDsP4VW1EVOF1elGhh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075417/Voice_access_bar.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voice Access lets you control Windows with your voice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1i6C3r"&gt;Voice Access will support opening apps, switching between them, and activities like browsing the web or reading and composing emails. Once enabled, you can use commands like “open Word” to open Microsoft’s word processing app, or even say “click” to select items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SR4RD6"&gt;Voice Access appears to be a combination of Microsoft’s various speech recognition tools in Windows over the years. It’s not yet clear when Voice Access will be available for all Windows 11 users, and Microsoft says new features will show up in future annual Windows releases or as part of monthly servicing releases.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon fined $1.3 billion for abusing market position in Italy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYrR6kVoPwwt_zqjnczhbidPIlw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248608/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R1vS5w"&gt;Amazon has been &lt;a href="https://agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/12/A528-chiusura"&gt;fined $1.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; (€1.1 billion) by antitrust regulators in Italy. The company is accused of using its dominance in the online shopping world to steer Italian sellers into using its logistics service, Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA). Amazon says it will appeal the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yin2qk"&gt;The fine is one of the largest levied by a single nation in the EU as part of a years-long battle over online antitrust issues. Just last month, Amazon and Apple were both fined by Italian antitrust regulators for allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/I842-"&gt;conspiring to limit the supply&lt;/a&gt; of Apple and Beats products. But that fine only totaled $77 million (€69 million) for Amazon — a drop in the bucket compared to today’s judgement. (Both companies are currently disputing the case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aBghpo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Italy says Amazon pushed sellers into using its logistics services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vjIwLO"&gt;In this latest ruling, Italy’s antitrust watchdog, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato or AGCM, is particularly concerned with the benefits Amazon gives to sellers on its platform that also pay to use its FBA logistics service. Sellers signed up to FBA can mark their goods with the Prime fulfillment label and participate in Amazon events like its Black Friday, Prime Day, and Cyber Monday sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IyZM8"&gt;“The investigation has ascertained that these are functions of the Amazon.it platform that are crucial for the success of sellers and for increasing their sales,” said the ACGM in a statement (translated via Google). “In doing so, Amazon has harmed competing e-commerce logistics operators by preventing them from proposing themselves to online sellers as providers of services of a quality comparable to that of Amazon’s fulfillment. These conducts have thus widened the gap between Amazon’s power and that of the competition also in the e-commerce order delivery business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UobbKl"&gt;The ACGM says the size of the fine reflects the seriousness of Amazon’s strategy and its duration over many years. In addition to paying the fine, Amazon must change its business practices in Italy, giving all third-party sellers on its platform the same “sales and visibility privileges,” regardless of whether or not they use Fulfillment by Amazon. Amazon has a year to comply with these rulings — unless, of course, it’s successful in its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfvckv"&gt;In a statement (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/italy-fines-amazon-for-abuse-of-dominant-position-085244332-085736675.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), the company said: “We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) and we will appeal. The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is retiring Alexa — no, not that one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDXH-OwHnwtaKvYZ1XrzfCzuzKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248592/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgYstZ"&gt;Amazon is shutting down Alexa Internet, a service that has provided web traffic analysis for more than two decades. Alexa was founded in 1996 and bought by Amazon in 1999 (15 years before the shopping giant revealed its digital assistant of the same name). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5QAxC"&gt;Alexa is best known for Alexa Rank, a ranking of the world’s most popular websites, with this information frequently referenced in news coverage and public resources like Wikipedia. The company extrapolates this data from a small sample of web users who use its &lt;a href="https://www.alexa.com/toolbar"&gt;browser extension&lt;/a&gt; and from sites which choose to install its &lt;a href="https://www.alexa.com/about"&gt;traffic monitoring software&lt;/a&gt; directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bDHjc"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://support.alexa.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410503838999"&gt;announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the Alexa.com team said the company stopped offering new subscriptions on December 8th, 2021, and will shut down the site on May 1st, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuqBuZ"&gt;“Twenty-five years ago, we founded Alexa Internet. After two decades of helping you find, reach, and convert your digital audience, we’ve made the difficult decision to retire Alexa.com on May 1, 2022. Thank you for making us your go-to resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much more,” reads the post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gr9jKM"&gt;Paid users of Alexa’s services can export their data and delete their account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05zVxf"&gt;Alexa.com’s rankings have always been simultaneously popular and contentious — not surprising given the importance of establishing traffic metrics in many online businesses. Over the years, there have been many accusations that the service’s Alexa Rank could be gamed, but it nevertheless remained the most familiar name in the web-ranking world. A number of alternate services exist, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.similarweb.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22825744%2Famazon-retiring-alexa-web-ranking-sevice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SimilarWeb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tranco-list.eu/"&gt;Tranco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/"&gt;ComScore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo teases its first foldable, the Find N</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/210HuY0HIuuHi38kluFnSvr6ByA=/0x0:1446x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248508/ezgif.com_gif_maker__7_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A short teaser trailer shows the folding mechanism in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWmyrz"&gt;Oppo has announced its first foldable smartphone, the Oppo Find N, in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oppo.com%2Fen%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress%2Foppo-inno-day-2021-pete-letter-findn%2F%3Fs%3D09&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22825716%2Foppo-find-n-foldable-inno-day-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; penned by its chief product officer (and OnePlus CEO) Pete Lau. The device will be launched next week on December 15th, on the second day of Oppo’s annual Inno Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmzUEx"&gt;Although the post doesn’t reveal too many specifics about the device, a teaser trailer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468777421243490312"&gt;released on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; shows it has a similar form factor to Samsung’s Z Fold devices, combining a large internal folding screen with a smaller outer screen that can be used like a traditional smartphone. Interestingly, this small outer screen looks like it has a similar aspect ratio to a traditional smartphone, unlike the tall thin external display of the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2broZE"&gt;In his post, Lau admits that other companies have beaten Oppo to commercializing foldable smartphones. But he claims that these competing devices haven’t had the “utility, durability, and user experience” to make them feasible purchases for most people. “For Oppo, it is better to launch a product at a later date when it is ready to offer a great user experience instead of simply rushing to keep up with trends,” Lau writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CbZPyd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the exquisitely engineered &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindN?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOFindN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Hold. Fold. Enjoy. Repeat.&lt;br&gt;Coming December 15. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOINNODAY2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOINNODAY2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LVZKNgYiAv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LVZKNgYiAv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468777421243490312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOBTso"&gt;The Find N is said to be the result of four years of R&amp;amp;D and six generations of prototypes, with Lau noting that the first generation of the Find N dates back to April 2018. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/25/18239353/oppo-foldable-phone-prototype-huawei-mate-x"&gt;February 2019 the company showed off&lt;/a&gt; one of its foldable prototypes, although this version had a single large display that wrapped around the outside of the device, as opposed to the Find N’s internal folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi8grN"&gt;Lau says the aim was to make a device with a beautiful design that feels good in the hand, while also being useful and easy to use. “For a foldable smartphone, both the closed-screen and open-screen experience should be equally simple to use,” Lau writes. “Then on top of that, we should create a groundbreaking efficient experience that a traditional smartphone cannot provide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hDUC3"&gt;Oppo plans to launch the Find N on the second day of its annual Inno Day event, where it typically shows off concept technologies and products. In previous years, Oppo has used these events to announce concept technologies like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;rollable phone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536363/oppo-x-2021-rollable-smartphone-demonstration-features"&gt;Oppo X 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as well as AR glasses, neither of which have made it to market. As well as the Find N, Oppo has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823689/oppo-retractable-phone-camera-teaser-inno-day-2021"&gt;teased a device with a retractable rear camera&lt;/a&gt; for this year’s Inno Day, as well as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468475432601370626"&gt;more augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktfd81"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cbisna"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AR headset reportedly uses 3D sensors for hand tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVPmyMe9aWsqzwUyemG7vkI4iDY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248440/acastro_170731_1777_0005_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkbnAo"&gt;Apple’s widely rumored upcoming mixed reality headset will make use of 3D sensors for advanced hand tracking, according to analyst Ming-chi Kuo, whose latest research note has been reported on by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/apple-ar-vr-hand-gesture-interface/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apples-mixed-reality-headset-to-have-advanced-hand-gesture-detection/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The headset is said to have four sets of 3D sensors, compared to the iPhone’s single unit, which should give it more accuracy than the TrueDepth camera array currently used for Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cerzh"&gt;According to Kuo, the structured light sensors can detect objects as well as “dynamic detail change” in the hands, comparable to how Face ID is able to figure out facial expressions to generate Animoji. “Capturing the details of hand movement can provide a more intuitive and vivid human-machine UI,” he writes, giving the example of a virtual balloon in your hand flying away once the sensors detect that your fist is no longer clenched. Kuo believes the sensors will be able to detect objects from up to 200 percent further away than the iPhone’s Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcjJHE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ycJiW2"&gt;Meta’s Quest headsets are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21260554/oculus-quest-anniversary-hand-tracking-third-party-games-beat-saber-tracks"&gt;capable of hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a core feature of the platform and it relies on conventional monochrome cameras. Kuo’s note doesn’t mention whether Apple’s headset will use physical controllers as well as hand tracking. Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in January that Apple was testing hand tracking for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PX4ay3"&gt;Kuo also this week provided some &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apple-ar-vr-headset/"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on what could come after Apple’s first headset. While he expects the first model to weigh in at around 300-400 grams (~0.66-0.88lbs), a “significantly lighter” second-generation model with an updated battery system and faster processor is said to be planned for 2024. The first model will arrive sometime next year, according to Kuo, and Apple reportedly expects it to sell about three million units in 2023. That suggests the initial product may well be expensive and aimed at early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;
