    <title>Record labels sue Roblox for letting users upload pirated songs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Holiday’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAuhRRK-KRwMIHArBZjXs4lsm7Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434047/LNX_Concert_HOLIDAY.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tIIML"&gt;The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) has sued &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; for letting users upload music from Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, deadmau5, and other artists without paying a licensing fee. &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912/gov.uscourts.cacd.822912.1.0.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit seeks&lt;/a&gt; $200 million in damages and a court order that will make &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; crack down on piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FHKre"&gt;The NMPA filed suit yesterday on behalf of several major music publishers. It accuses &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;massively popular, kid-focused platform&lt;/a&gt; for games and social experiences — of hosting a shared library of copyrighted but unlicensed songs. The complaint alleges that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively preys on its impressionable user base and their desire for popular music, teaching children that pirating music is perfectly acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KeRkpr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Roblox’ allows a prodigious level of infringing material”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ucvZMc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; offers a library of audio files, 3D models, and other assets for building experiences. Users upload these files themselves, but the NMPA claims &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; “actively encourages” adding popular songs. It also notes that users pay for uploading audio files with in-game currency. “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; allows a prodigious level of infringing material through its gates, purposely turning a blind eye for the sake of profit,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94QiQ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/06/addressing-recently-filed-litigation-certain-music-publishers/"&gt;responded to the complaint&lt;/a&gt; on its website. “We are surprised and disappointed by this lawsuit which represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; platform operates, and will defend &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; vigorously as we work to achieve a fair resolution,” the statement says. It notes that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has partnered with music labels for authorized events &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;like a Lil Nas X concert&lt;/a&gt; last year, and the company &lt;a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/upcoming-music-changes-and-copyright-related-action/130570"&gt;signed a licensing deal&lt;/a&gt; with APM Music in 2018. “We do not tolerate copyright infringement, which is why we use industry-leading, advanced filtering technology to detect and prohibit unauthorized recordings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwvkEJ"&gt;As the complaint notes, searching &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s library for exact names like “Ed Sheeran” or “Ariana Grande” returns no results. But searching for partial terms like “Sheeran” or “Ariana” will pull up tracks labeled with popular songs from both artists. (Not all the labels are accurate — one file titled “Ed Sheeran - The Shape Of You” is actually a sound clip from &lt;em&gt;The Purge, &lt;/em&gt;for instance.) “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s use of filtering technology has been nothing more than an empty gesture to mask its long history of instigating, inducing, and encouraging users, including children, to infringe copyrighted music,” the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UVsbR"&gt;Virtually all big web platforms clash with record labels at some point, and the disputes often end with the companies striking a deal. The NMPA and Google &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/08/music-publishers-youtube-end-spat-061592"&gt;settled a similar lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over YouTube copyright infringement in 2011, leading to the platform’s current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16796058/youtube-universal-music-group-sony-agreement-royalties"&gt;royalty-sharing agreement&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside the news of this lawsuit, the NMPA announced a “major ramp-up” of copyright takedown notices against Twitch — pressuring parent company Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534983/riaa-copyright-twitch-streamers-licensing-letter"&gt;into expanding&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;currently limited licensing deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Control is free on the Epic Games Store for one week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EQ5MA_s-OOH7Bc9HDPyC-wyJ64=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433983/Drifter_combat.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNoH1s"&gt;Remedy’s excellent supernatural thriller &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; is available for free on the Epic Games Store from now until June 17th at 11AM ET. All you need is an Epic Games account — just log in to the store while the deal is live, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/control"&gt;claim your copy of the game for PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdjoPp"&gt;If you haven’t played &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; before, I highly recommend picking it up. I really liked exploring the game’s spooky paranormal world, and using protagonist Jesse Faden’s psychic abilities to fling objects from the environment at enemies is a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIMqD0"&gt;Epic is offering &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale"&gt;Mega Sale&lt;/a&gt;, which also runs through June 17th. Like last year, Epic is offering its $10 Epic Coupons that are applied automatically at checkout on eligible games that cost $14.99 or more during the sale. There are also some big discounts on hit games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x7Fvxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Epic’s Mega Sale returns with free NBA 2K21 and deals on Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Cyberpunk 2077, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445708/epic-games-mega-sale-free-deals-coupons"},{"title":"Control is an excellent supernatural thriller with hints of Metroid","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The Hoover Dam reservoir is at an all-time low </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tourists Visit The Hoover Dam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ChAsHArl0uxSV2BwTQkG0S7c74c=/0x0:4974x3316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433928/1253437187.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A general view of Lake Mead, a human-made lake that lies on the Colorado River, about 24 miles southeast of the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the states of Nevada and Arizona, on December 21st, 2019, in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada. Formed by the Hoover Dam, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States and serves water to the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada, as well as some of Mexico, providing sustenance to nearly 20 million people and large areas of farmland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paul Rovere / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FKF81y"&gt;Lake Mead, the reservoir created by the Hoover Dam, that feeds water to 25 million people across Western states, is historically low. On June 9th, the water level dipped to &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/levels.html"&gt;1,071.57&lt;/a&gt; feet above sea level, narrowly beating a &lt;a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2016/05/19/lake-mead-declines-new-record-low/84597120/"&gt;record low&lt;/a&gt; last set in &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/lakemead_line.pdf"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaQJpU"&gt;The lake surface has dropped 140 feet since 2000, leaving the reservoir just 37 percent full. With such a dramatic drop, officials expect to declare an official &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/05/27/hoover-dam-drought-water-levels-lake-mead/5134031001/"&gt;water shortage&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever. That could affect water and energy that Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam deliver to Arizona, California, and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPeCDY"&gt;Water levels at Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, are &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/24mo/2021/MAY21.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to keep dropping throughout the year. The drought tugging at the lake’s water levels is affecting other states in the region, too. “Please join me and Utahns, regardless of religious affiliation, in a weekend of humble prayer for rain,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in a video plea last week. He declared a state of emergency in March as Utah, like much of the West, plunged deep into drought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GPrABk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amid dangerous drought conditions, we’re inviting all Utahns — regardless of religious affiliation — to join us this weekend in collective and humble prayer for rain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/uJzFARl7BI"&gt;https://t.co/uJzFARl7BI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HS755aXEy3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HS755aXEy3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Utah Gov.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5y0G6"&gt;The West is ablaze in deep red and burgundy on drought &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; for the US, signaling “extreme” to “exceptional drought.” Farmers, who are already abandoning crops for lack of water, are &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/environment/article/Pulling-out-trees-trucking-water-for-cows-16234207.php"&gt;feeling the strain&lt;/a&gt; the most. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A snapshot of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Drought Monitor on June 1st, 2021." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-lGE6g3CR0n9C2D5Ybs9C-AInU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649983/usdroughtmonitor_weekly_ndmc__web__2021_06_01.png"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SPHStz"&gt;It didn’t help that a sweltering spring &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/04/heat-wave-united-states/"&gt;heatwave&lt;/a&gt; hit much of the continental US this past weekend. Las Vegas, some 30 miles from Lake Mead, reached 109 degrees Fahrenheit and could see even higher temperatures &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/weather/looming-heat-wave-could-push-173024866.html"&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;. Altogether, the drought and heat are scary omens for this year’s fire season. An above-normal risk of fire is &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;forecasted&lt;/a&gt; for the Southwest through June, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8T2B2"&gt;In July, the Southwest’s monsoon season is expected to kick in and provide some relief — at least temporarily. &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/"&gt;Climate change has brought on&lt;/a&gt; higher spring and summer temperatures, more severe wildfires, less snow (which much of the West relies on for water), and more intense dry seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWk2Qv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with true wireless earbuds. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut, even outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H3uSbA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Right now, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodsDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$146 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to $200 or lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163118618412109#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are also currently selling the AirPods Pro for $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHhsSe"&gt;The recently-launched AirPods Max have yet to receive a steep discount, but right now you can pick up the silver, blue, and space gray configurations at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $30 off their initial retail price, bringing your total to $520. It’s not much, however, it’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the AirPods Max to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus updates its midrange Nord with new processor and a headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFsKI0A7E2BNkz8JgQoLdp3_6po=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433448/OnePlus_Nord_CE_5G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G will be available in black, blue, and silver.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPgJcu"&gt;OnePlus has announced a new addition to its lineup of midrange phones, the Nord CE. According to the company, the “CE” stands for “Core Edition,” an indication that the company is focusing on the fundamentals, rather than inflating the device’s spec sheet with unnecessary extras. The phone is launching in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egSlyU"&gt;What this focus on the fundamentals means in practice is that the Nord CE is slightly stripped down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;last year’s Nord&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s slightly higher-specced than its predecessor, too. So you’re getting a higher-resolution 64-megapixel main camera (up from 48 megapixels), but there are only three rear sensors in total. (There’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide with a 119-degree field of view and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor.) The Nord CE also only has a single 16-megapixel selfie camera, with no secondary ultrawide like the original Nord. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOENK9aP_B8wGZ-Jdf9g3RrqxqI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22650055/Nord_CE_all_three_colours.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone features a very similar design to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mMJRZa"&gt;Internally, there’s a Snapdragon 750G powering this year’s model, compared to the 765G in last year’s phone. OnePlus claims its CPU is 20 percent faster, while its GPU is 10 percent faster. That’s paired with a choice of 6, 8, or 12GB of RAM, although these options vary slightly based on region. There’s a 4,500mAh battery inside the Nord CE, up from 4,115mAh last year, and the phone supports Warp Charge 30T Plus fast charging, which OnePlus says should charge you from 0 to 70 percent in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naiktt"&gt;Externally, the Nord CE looks very similar to its predecessor. It’s got a very similarly styled camera bump on the back left (though with three rather than four cameras) and a hole-punch for its selfie camera on the front of the phone (again, with one rather than two cameras). However, on the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a headphone jack, which was missing from last year’s device. In terms of display, the Nord CE comes with a 6.43-inch 90Hz 1080p OLED panel. The phone is available in blue, black, or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n6EZm"&gt;The Nord CE will be available to preorder in limited quantities from OnePlus itself starting today in the UK, and these devices will ship on June 14th. The device goes on general sale on June 21st. In the UK, it starts at £299 (€329) for the model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and £369 (€399) for the model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. In Europe, there’s a version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which will retail for €299. Those prices are slightly cheaper than the original Nord, which started at £379 (€399) for its 8GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzkoZL"&gt;Like the original Nord, OnePlus says it doesn’t have plans to release the Nord CE in the US. Instead, the US has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; to look forward to. It’s a successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;N100&lt;/a&gt; that OnePlus CEO Pete Lau recently confirmed will retail for under $250.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside the cryptocurrency scam vortex</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustrated Dogecoin surrounded by warning signs." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ysyLh3NaVx6zZY1yCpca7z4cCro=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433362/VRG_4614_9_Dogecoin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lpbuE"&gt;On May 22nd, a crypto finance project called DeFi100 posted a message to its website: “We scammed you guys and you can’t do shit about it. HA HA. All you moon bois have been scammed and you can’t do shit about it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk05mT"&gt;Screenshots of the message immediately went viral on crypto Twitter (always anarchic, easily risible). A popular anonymous crypto-tracking Twitter account called Mr. Whale &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoWhale/status/1396100822245777408"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that DeFi100 had run off with $32 million. Cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-may-have-absconded-with-32m-in-investor-funds"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-231952405.html"&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, ran with the number. The project owners &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DEFI100/status/1396489770281226244"&gt;denied any foul play&lt;/a&gt;, and it soon became clear the message was a website hack rather than a serious warning — but by then, it was too late. Panic had set in, and the price of the underlying coin was in free fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUWfTV"&gt;“We never stole any funds,” a representative for the project told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “DeFi100 was a very small project, and we were not holding any investors’ funds, so there are no questions of scamming people or running away with their funds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kb9pdg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s little recourse when crypto investments turn out to be scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBL8TO"&gt;DeFi100’s problems are a small part of the picture, but they’re a reminder of the dangers of the ongoing crypto boom. Despite billions of dollars pouring into the space in recent months, there’s still little recourse when investments turn out to be scams. Most importantly, the radical decentralization of the blockchain means there is simply no way to get your money back — and few assurances that an unproven vendor will keep their promises once the transaction goes through. The result is a new gold rush in crypto scams, as speculators seek ever more obscure opportunities and riskier bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwuLJY"&gt;The DeFi100 project’s website is now back online, but rumors persist about what actually happened. Certik, a popular blockchain security leaderboard, does &lt;a href="https://www.certik.org/"&gt;currently list DeFi100&lt;/a&gt; as a “rug pull,” which is a term for a scam where the founders of a project raise investment money and run. (The project owners say a rug pull would be impossible since they never held investor funds.) It’s just one of a string of scams that today’s crypto holders need to watch out for, along with sketchy altcoins, Discord pump-and-dumps, Elon Musk impersonators, and more &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/don-t-blame-crypto-for-ransomware"&gt;malicious forms of cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHj5Ln"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marenaltman?lang=en"&gt;Maren Altman&lt;/a&gt;, a TikTok influencer with over a million followers who creates videos about cryptocurrency and astrology, there are three kinds of risk that crypto holders should be wary of: bad investments, collapsing projects, and outright scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EyliYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subreddits like r/cryptocurrency are awash with accusations of “scam coins”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMDsbB"&gt;The first and most common kind of risk is simple bad investments in obscure coins. Outside of major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are thousands of smaller coins built on the blockchain technology, promising huge rewards if the coin ever comes to prominence. Subreddits like r/cryptocurrency are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=scam%20coin&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1"&gt;awash with accusations&lt;/a&gt; of “scam coins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHbDgO"&gt;“I mean, I’m in a handful of those myself, where it’s just the investment, it was a promise, the development didn’t go through, and I’m still waiting,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8aBYO"&gt;Trying to research obscure altcoins can be confusing for inexperienced traders. Links to cryptocurrency Discord servers often pop up on Twitter, promising an easy pump-and-dump of a smaller crypto coin. Or more confusingly, Twitter bots will accuse Discord servers that don’t exist of pump-and-dumps, hoping to drive up value for a separate coin. But while they promise easy money, the reality is less enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7YqX2"&gt;Another risk is the oftentimes innocent but unfortunate mismanagement of funds. In a bullish crypto market, everyone thinks they have a revolutionary idea involving cryptocurrency. And, obviously, &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-cryptocurrency-sector-is-overflowing-with-dead-projects"&gt;a lot of them don’t pan out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOahDk"&gt;“Things not being clarified, errors in contract, or just a weak link in the development circle,” Altman explained, “leading to mismanagement of money and people not having their investment turn out as expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuJOo8"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cryptocurrency-failures-all-time/"&gt;extremely well-known example&lt;/a&gt; of this was the DAO project. It launched in the spring of 2016 to huge fanfare, only to be completely defunct by the fall of the same year. The project was created by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization and was an attempt to build a venture capital fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Only a month or two in, a hacker &lt;a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao"&gt;found a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in the token’s code and made off with $50 million. Traders started selling off DAO tokens en masse and the price never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0STOrY"&gt;Sometimes this chaos can end in outright fraud. According to the Federal Trade Commission, crypto-based financial scams &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2021/05/cryptocurrency-buzz-drives-record-investment-scam-losses"&gt;are at an all-time high&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the surging interest in cryptocurrency. And the line between well-meaning blunder and crypto Ponzi scheme is blurry. Just ask investors of OneCoin or PayCoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZgDZXe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In 2019, PayCoin founder Homero Joshua Garza was sentenced to 21 months in prison&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CAHnMO"&gt;OneCoin launched in the mid-2010s and was billed as an educational crypto trading service. It turns out the OneCoin tokens being purchased by investors &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/4b-ponzi-scheme-onecoin-and-cryptoqueen-leader-found-in-default-in-us-lawsuit"&gt;weren’t actually on the blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. It was accused of being a Ponzi scheme and its founders ran off with close to $4 billion. It &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/06/is-onecoin-the-biggest-financial-fraud-in-history/"&gt;has been called&lt;/a&gt; one of the biggest financial scams in history. One of its founders, Ruja Ignatova, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84"&gt;is still missing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVXyiY"&gt;In 2019, PayCoin founder Homero Joshua Garza &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/cryptocurrency-fraudster-sentenced-021119"&gt;was sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution after he created his own cryptocurrency and offered it to investors with the assurance that he had secured a $100 million reserve of capital. There was no reserve, and the whole project &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoManiaks/crypto-scams-like-pay-coin-will-you-be-their-next-victim-medium-a8f6575daff8"&gt;ended up losing $9 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQDUX2"&gt;But even with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-31/roshun-patel-on-what-really-happened-during-the-crypto-market-crash"&gt;May 2021’s sizable dip&lt;/a&gt; in value for big coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cryptocurrency is more popular than ever, and legions of inexperienced traders are learning the hard way what a peer-to-peer financial service actually means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiSBl2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajKA"&gt;Neeraj Agrawal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of communications for Coin Center, one of the US’s biggest cryptocurrency advocacy groups, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that wildly speculative coins (known colloquially as “shitcoins”) are now a permanent part of the cryptocurrency space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLWsZT"&gt;“The insane speculative garbage coins are not going to go away,” Agrawal says. “That’s just part of the world now. And it sort of remains to us to show that the really good projects are worth their existence, that there is actual value here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6TEpW"&gt;That’s particularly hard when crypto celebrities like Elon Musk are driving interest toward the wackier end of the crypto space. Musk recently fueled the massive spike in interest around Dogecoin, a failed crypto coin invented as a joke that’s named after the famous Shiba Inu meme. Musk’s tweets have also been blamed for &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/24/investing/elon-musk-bitcoin-dogecoin-tesla/index.html"&gt;this month’s massive market downturn&lt;/a&gt;. It’s &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/experts-answer-how-does-elon-musk-affect-crypto-space"&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; what effect Musk has on the market, but his recent branding as the main character of crypto has led to a litany of Musk-themed scams. According to the FTC, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/elon-musk-impersonators-stole-more-than-2-million-in-crypto-scams-.html"&gt;people impersonating Musk&lt;/a&gt; have managed to scam at least $2 million from traders this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KEe0bK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A market really only requires two things ... a seller and a buyer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78vEIL"&gt;“Maybe that’s the biggest risk to crypto users — your own stupidity,” joked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem"&gt;Meltem Demirors&lt;/a&gt;, the chief strategy officer of digital-asset investment firm CoinShares. “I think people just aren’t accustomed to taking responsibility for their financial lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqjBBX"&gt;In fact, I was asked by both a family member and a close friend this month about an obscure cryptocurrency called Dogelon Mars. It’s currently worth $0.00000016 USD, but the two people close to me were considering buying a bunch of it because they mistakenly believed that, due to the name and its frankly &lt;a href="https://dogelon.io/"&gt;confusing description&lt;/a&gt;, it was a coin launched by Musk himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pf04S"&gt;Demirors told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Dogelon Mars was actually one of her favorite meme coins. “We have to remember, right, the whole point of a lot of this is permission-less financial innovation,” she says. “And a market really only requires two things. It requires a seller and a buyer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPjMuM"&gt;She said this was the main explanation behind the recent NFT explosion. People had crypto coins on hand and wanted to see what they could spend them on. Turns out what they wanted to buy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;surreal internet art&lt;/a&gt; for millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLLA76"&gt;“I always think it’s really funny when people are all about crypto and permission-less financial innovation, but then the minute they lose money, they become like the most statist people imaginable,” Demirors said. “You really can’t have it both ways. Like you bought this shitcoin. You now need to make your bed and lie in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the Summer Game Fest’s ‘Kickoff Live’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YICq9gnIIpn96EkLdl644mEgG4M=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433303/E3JlJZNVcAE73j6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Summer Game Fest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRI49d"&gt;Summer Game Fest 2021, hosted by Geoff Keighley, is getting started with new game announcements two days ahead of E3 2021 with its “Kickoff Live” event. In addition to news, it’s perhaps the only event to feature both an appearance from Jeff Goldblum and a musical performance by Weezer. The list of partners for the preview event includes 2K, Activision, Blizzard, Capcom, InnerSloth, Epic Games, Sony PlayStation, Riot Games, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Microsoft Xbox, and more. Here’s how to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jv5JaK"&gt;When does Summer Game Fest start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HTaFNL"&gt;The kickoff show is happening this Thursday, June 10th at 2PM ET / 11AM PT / 6PM GMT. And like last year’s happenings, it’s all online, so you can just hang out at home and watch all of the announcements from your PC, phone, or TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q22D1o"&gt;Like last year, there will likely be more Summer Game Fest events throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1mF4aA"&gt;Where can I stream Summer Game Fest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SVbwU1"&gt;This game event is being hosted on several platforms, giving you plenty of options. It’s being livestreamed on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MqXeohrnoaY"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (we’ve embedded the video above that’ll go live later), as well as &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s 4K HDR-ready Ultra is $69 at multiple retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dItJtJBQeXgB-WI7FWGvo0w3rqM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433154/45C359B1_1BB2_40B0_923A_5ADB95641327.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7i9EF"&gt;The Roku Ultra 4K HDR streaming device is $30 off at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?subId1=VergeDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-Ultra-2020-Streaming-Media-Player-HD-4K-HDR-Dolby-Vision-Dolby-Atmos-Bluetooth-Streaming-Voice-Remote-Headphone-Jack-Personal-Shortcuts-includes%2F901647298&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741643899319516880#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Bluetooth-Headphone-Shortcuts/dp/B08G9TJWW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; today, which drops the price to $69. This is currently Roku’s high-end model, and it apparently has 50 percent more range than the previous model, with a faster quad-core processor that makes channels launch faster. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459599/roku-ultra-2020-announced-features-dolby-vision-wifi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 2020 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; offers 4K playback at up to 60 frames per second, as well as support for Dolby Atmos content and Atmos-ready home entertainment gear. For HDR support, it boasts Dolby Vision and HDR10 compatibility. This device has an ethernet port for the fastest streaming possible in your home, and it includes a wireless remote and a set of earbuds for private listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NG9uSn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10518754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7eAJxw"&gt;Woot is offering a great deal on refurbished AirPods that come with a wireless charging case. These “grade A” units, which Woot says equates to minimal cosmetic damage, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-2-wireless-charging-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost just $110&lt;/a&gt;. This model costs $150 at Amazon, so it’s a good opportunity to save some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zEvcu4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LtvIWo"&gt;Best Buy has the exclusive on a bundle of Razer PC gaming gear that should be a good fit for anyone who needs some new peripherals. Its so-called “Battle Bundle” contains the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BlackShark V2 X&lt;/a&gt; wired gaming headset, the DeathAdder V2 wired gaming mouse (it’s one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my favorite wired models&lt;/a&gt; in terms of comfort), and the Gigantus V2 M mousepad. All of this would usually cost you well over $100, but you &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035704037356033#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can get it for $80&lt;/a&gt;. This deal will last until June 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZOHpl"&gt;Best Buy has discounted &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035822184865453#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many other Razer products&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3T6EA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600204"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBU9zt"&gt;Amazon is still offering a good deal on a one-year subscription to PS Plus, the online service that allows online multiplayer on PS4 and PS5, as well as bringing complimentary games to members each month. Normally $60, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $45 for a digital code&lt;/a&gt; that you can redeem on your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3BFr6h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QoPBgm"&gt;We featured an attractive $70 off deal yesterday on the Apple Watch Series 6. That was for the GPS-enabled model (and it’s still happening), but if you’ve had your eye out for sales on the LTE-ready model, Amazon has one. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B08J628R4C?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 40mm-sized Series 6 in blue costs $400&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This is $30 less than other colors offered at Amazon and Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is using AI to design its next generation of AI chips more quickly than humans can</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j603NoJJ_fx0kBhkrdae67RZNmU=/0x42:1000x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433132/tpu_v2_hero_2.max_1000x1000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The algorithms were used to design an upcoming version of Google’s TPU chips. Pictured above is TPUv2, announced in 2017. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mcDpQb"&gt;Google is using machine learning to help design its next generation of machine learning chips. The algorithm’s designs are “comparable or superior” to those created by humans, say Google’s engineers, but can be generated much, much faster. According to the tech giant, work that takes months for humans can be accomplished by AI in under six hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSOpFP"&gt;Google has been working on how to use machine learning to create chips &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/13/google-ai-chief-jeff-dean-interview-machine-learning-trends-in-2020/"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, but this recent effort — described this week &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w"&gt;in a paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;seems to be the first time its research has been applied to a commercial product: an upcoming version of Google’s own TPU (&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu"&gt;tensor processing unit&lt;/a&gt;) chips, which are optimized for AI computation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9GNTM"&gt;“Our method has been used in production to design the next generation of Google TPU,” write the authors of the paper, led by Google’s head of ML for Systems, Azalia Mirhoseini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvSQmi"&gt;AI, in other words, is helping accelerate the future of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBQeDT"&gt;In the paper, Google’s engineers note that this work has “major implications” for the chip industry. It should allow companies to more quickly explore the possible architecture space for upcoming designs and more easily customize chips for specific workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pqDrj"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01507-9"&gt;editorial in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;calls the research an “important achievement,” and notes that such work could help offset the forecasted end of Moore’s Law — an axiom of chip design from the 1970s that states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. AI won’t necessarily solve the &lt;a href="https://www.technologist.eu/the-end-of-moores-law-reign/"&gt;physical challenges&lt;/a&gt; of squeezing more and more transistors onto chips, but it could help find other paths to increasing performance at the same rate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQk8IMS8Y5lmZ7C0Jgn16GpnDuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8529871/TPU_PERSON_FORWEBONLY_FINAL.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s TPU chips are offered as part of its cloud services and used internally for AI research. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ODIaCZ"&gt;The specific task that Google’s algorithms tackled is known as “floorplanning.” This usually requires human designers who work with the aid of computer tools to find the optimal layout on a silicon die for a chip’s sub-systems. These components include things like CPUs, GPUs, and memory cores, which are connected together using tens of kilometers of minuscule wiring. Deciding where to place each component on a die affects the eventual speed and efficiency of the chip. And, given both the scale of chip manufacture and computational cycles, nanometer-changes in placement can end up having huge effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L8aO4Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google compared the challenge of chip design to a board game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MHN0c"&gt;Google’s engineers note that designing floor plans takes “months of intense effort” for humans, but, from a machine learning perspective, there is a familiar way to tackle this problem: as a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOQuFg"&gt;AI has proven &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495548/deepmind-ai-go-alphago-zero-self-taught"&gt;time and time again&lt;/a&gt; it can outperform humans at board games like chess and Go, and Google’s engineers note that floorplanning is analogous to such challenges. Instead of a game board, you have a silicon die. Instead of pieces like knights and rooks, you have components like CPUs and GPUs. The task, then, is to simply find each board’s “win conditions.” In chess that might be checkmate, in chip design it’s computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MflkXW"&gt;Google’s engineers trained a reinforcement learning algorithm on a dataset of 10,000 chip floor plans of varying quality, some of which had been randomly generated. Each design was tagged with a specific “reward” function based on its success across different metrics like the length of wire required and power usage. The algorithm then used this data to distinguish between good and bad floor plans and generate its own designs in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqwFXs"&gt;As we’ve seen when AI systems take on humans at board games, machines don’t necessarily think like humans and often arrive at unexpected solutions to familiar problems. When DeepMind’s AlphaGo played human champion Lee Sedol at Go, this dynamic led to the infamous “&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/"&gt;move 37&lt;/a&gt;” — a seemingly illogical piece placement by the AI that nevertheless led to victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t86Ab0"&gt;Nothing quite so dramatic happened with Google’s chip-designing algorithm, but its floor plans nevertheless look quite different to those created by a human. Instead of neat rows of components laid out on the die, sub-systems look like they’ve almost been scattered across the silicon at random. An &lt;a href="https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-021-01515-9/d41586-021-01515-9_19234272.png"&gt;illustration from &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the difference, with the human design on the left and machine learning design on the right. You can also see the general difference in the image below from Google’s paper (orderly humans on the left; jumbled AI on the right), though the layout has been blurred as it’s confidential:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h60PSDFydysVk6ujis9VNZGD1Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649839/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_1.10.40_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mirhoseini, A. et al&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A human-designed chip floor plan is on the left, and the AI-designed floor plan on the right. The images have been blurred by the paper’s authors as they represent confidential designs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1uLHcE"&gt;This paper is noteworthy, particularly because its research is now being used commercially by Google. But it’s far from the only aspect of AI-assisted chip design. Google itself has explored using AI in other parts of the process like “&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-deep-learning-finds-a-critical-path-in-ai-chips/"&gt;architecture exploration&lt;/a&gt;,” and rivals like Nvidia are looking into other methods to &lt;a href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2020-09_Accelerating-Chip-Design"&gt;speed up the workflow&lt;/a&gt;. The virtuous cycle of AI designing chips for AI looks like it’s only just getting started. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to set up a VPN</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a computer with a wireframe globe on the screen surrounded by question marks and random longitude and latitude coordinates." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZYD7j9rj-AtEBJXj4Cz0WOcpaA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433118/VRG_4614_2_VPN.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sl1apd"&gt;Virtual private networks (VPNs) can offer an additional layer of security and privacy for your online activity. Whether you’re working on a public Wi-Fi network and want to escape prying eyes, or you’re worried about privacy in general, a VPN can offer a lot of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbrixj"&gt;In a nutshell, a VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a private server, hiding your traffic from being seen by others. Of course, the VPN itself can still see your traffic, which is why you should choose a VPN from a company you trust. (A good rule of thumb is to avoid free VPNs, because if they’re not charging you a fee, they may be monetizing in some less desirable way.) In addition, law enforcement can get its hands on your information through the VPN company. However, for the most part, a VPN offers you a way to hide your online activity from others. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TL2vsV"&gt;Note that getting a VPN is only one of the measures you can take to make your web browsing more secure. Others include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/17/15772142/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication"&gt;enabling two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;using a password manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pKQ3p"&gt;In addition to their security benefits, VPNs can be handy when you’re trying to access sensitive information, or if you’re traveling in Europe and want to stream &lt;a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/bypass-vpn-blocks/"&gt;Netflix or Amazon Prime titles only allowed in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Some even claim they can allow you to jump firewalls in heavily regulated countries &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-vpn-for-china-our-5-top-choices"&gt;such as China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DhrA8B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In addition to their security benefits, VPNs can come in handy when you’re trying to access sensitive information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQTM4G"&gt;At home, you can set up your VPN through your router, which takes a few more steps, but then any devices connected to your router won’t need to be configured individually; this can also slow down all traffic that goes through. However, for this article, we’re going to concentrate on VPN apps that you can load on your laptop or phone so you can use the internet safely while away from your home base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdiRVh"&gt;Most VPN apps these days support the OpenVPN protocol, making setup a simple matter of allowing the app access to configure the settings for you. But whether your device uses macOS, Chrome OS, Windows 10, iOS, or Android, if you’d like a quick overview of what’s involved before selecting a service, or if you prefer to do a manual setup, we’ve broken down the steps into straightforward instructions for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qx1SYC"&gt;Setting up a VPN in Windows 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nQoH8W"&gt;The first step is to create a VPN profile, which you’ll fill out with details from your particular VPN service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Add a VPN profile in Windows 10." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/53Xw6LZvIDjn90hDLsVwcMDvims=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540915/windows_10_vpn.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add a VPN profile in Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Mdlj8R"&gt;Click on the Windows button, then head into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Network &amp;amp; Internet” &amp;gt; “VPN.” Click on “Add a VPN connection.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MSgkCB"&gt;In the fields on the menu, select “Windows (built-in)” for your VPN provider. Give your VPN a name under “Connection name.” Enter the server name or address, the VPN type, and the type of sign-in info, such as a username and password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XMDXSP"&gt;Click “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rqiVht"&gt;To connect to your VPN, go back to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Network &amp;amp; Internet” &amp;gt; “VPN.” Click on your VPN name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HqiYlb"&gt;If you want, you can select “Advanced Options” to edit the connection properties, clear your sign-in info, or set up a VPN proxy. You can also add a username and password in this section for extra security (optional, but recommended).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ijItHq"&gt;Select “Connect” and enter a password if you’ve set one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hC4Hsp"&gt;Setting up a VPN in Chrome OS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BmsEld"&gt;While using a VPN with a Chromebook used to be a problem, these days, there are several (like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Fvpn-software%2Fvpn-chromebook&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22454548%2Fvpn-set-up-how-to-macos-ios-windows-chrome-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ExpressVPN&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nordvpn.com/download/chromebook/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordVPN&lt;/a&gt;) that have versions specifically for Chrome OS. To get started, you can head to the Google Play store and get the VPN app from there, or download one from the VPN’s website. No matter which you choose, after opening your VPN app, it should prompt you with instructions on how to fully set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MMH3f"&gt;If you need to do it manually, you can. Chrome has native support for L2TP / IPsec and OpenVPN. To install a VPN that works with one of these formats:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Chrome OS has native support for L2TP / IPsec." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AtqiOpw6wqrbuX1IyH7xUZ9qbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14811441/Screenshot_2019_02_28_at_9.22.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS has native support for L2TP / IPsec.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="87v8G5"&gt;Click on the time in the lower-right corner of your screen, then click on “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UziYyp"&gt;Click on “Add connection” and then on “OpenVPN / L2TP.” (You may also find the name of your VPN in the “Add connection” list, which will make things easier.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SwBOhF"&gt;Add all of the necessary information, which may include server hostname, service name, provider type, pre-shared key, username, and password. You can save your identity and password if you like. When finished, click on “Connect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="H5V3bZ"&gt;Some VPNs, especially those issued from a workplace, demand a certificate, which you will need to import first. If that’s required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cdvMRr"&gt;Enter &lt;em&gt;chrome://settings/certificates&lt;/em&gt; into the address bar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NuvljE"&gt;Go to the “Authorities” tab. Find the correct certificate in the list and click “Import.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9XkvxJ"&gt;Then follow the instructions above for setting up the VPN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JIkZYV"&gt;Setting up a VPN in macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S0hKuc"&gt;As with the other formats here, there are apps that automatically guide you through the setup process, but you can also do it yourself manually. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the drop-down menu and choose “VPN” so you can enter your VPN’s details." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UrNrwPKX5Naup6ndGxvsxsPCmZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14749608/Adding_a_VPN_to_macOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the drop-down menu and choose “VPN” so you can enter your VPN’s details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="30rO70"&gt;To start, head into “System Preferences” and then choose “Network.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iIyIUh"&gt;From there, the process is straightforward. Click the Plus-symbol button on the bottom left, and use the Interface drop-down menu to choose your VPN. You’ll need the details from your VPN of choice to fill out “VPN Type” and “Service Name.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ky7Lr6"&gt;Click on “Create.” Fill out the server address, remote ID, and local ID in the appropriate fields. Then click on “Authentication Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tv0iql"&gt;Enter the username and password for your VPN, which you can set through your VPN app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Otp8Yx"&gt;Click “OK” and then “Connect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y3sXRr"&gt;Setting up a VPN in iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sWbL1W"&gt;Setting up a VPN on an iOS device is fairly simple. Again, if you download an app from the App Store, select it and it should guide you through configuration. Here’s how to do it manually, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s not hard to add a VPN configuration." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZ9nrOXjOGOYrR5OKDRC4zzhVUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14809914/Image_from_iOS__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not hard to add a VPN configuration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This is also where you can delete the VPN." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDkJ28Itk7D-QzOBFRJuco9uqp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14810233/Image_from_iOS__7_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is also where you can delete the VPN.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ukfc0z"&gt;Just head into “Settings” and tap on “General.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsRuSs"&gt;Scroll down to select “VPN.” (The iPhone will indicate whether you are currently connected to one or not.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MTpcTr"&gt;Tap on “Add VPN Configuration” and then on “Type” to select a security protocol. (Follow the instructions provided by your chosen app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CZUpyk"&gt;Go back to the “Add Configuration” screen, where you will add the VPN’s description, server, remote ID, and local ID. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yvEHHN"&gt;Enter your username and password. You can also use a proxy if you like. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="K5zWRk"&gt;Tap “Done.” You will then be brought back to the VPN screen. Toggle the “Status” switch to on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iyHV2p"&gt;Setting up a VPN in Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WFS2S5"&gt;As with iOS, setting up a VPN on an Android device shouldn’t be too difficult. Here’s the manual process if you’re not letting an app automatically configure things for you. (Keep in mind that, because some vendors like Samsung tweak their Android versions, your process may vary slightly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Since this is Android, your setup menu may vary." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6uBuBcw3Tvk-buJCJbCqBxcxhtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14811246/Screenshot_20190228_090212.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since this is Android, your setup menu may vary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Just hit “OK” and you’ve got a VPN." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMNlHdN1FiHnkYaEaNasrxWvvOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14811258/Screenshot_20190228_091122.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just hit “OK” and you’ve got a VPN.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RPsKfy"&gt;Head into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Network &amp;amp; Internet” &amp;gt; “Advanced” &amp;gt; “VPN.” If you don’t see “Network &amp;amp; Internet” in the Settings menu (which may depend on your Android overlay), then do a search within Settings for VPN. Press the “Add” button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7DjO5Q"&gt;If you happen to be setting this up on a new phone, or if you haven’t yet set a screen lock or password, Google will prompt you to set one for your phone first. Do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WwKTOn"&gt;Now create your VPN profile. Add the VPN name, type, and server address. Click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="igQ9cV"&gt;You’ll be taken back to the VPN screen, where you should now see the name of your VPN. Tap on it, and put in your name and password for the VPN. You can also choose to save your account information, and you can optionally set the VPN to be always on. When finished, tap “Connect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QV6pjk"&gt;Enter the VPN name, type, server address, username, and password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="csZBjy"&gt;Then tap “save.” You’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="9dD7b7"&gt;Once you’ve got your VPN up and running, you might notice that web browsing isn’t as fast as it used to be, especially if you’ve configured traffic to go through another country. Stronger encryption, or more users connected to one VPN, can also slow down your internet speeds. Downloads might slow to snail speed, and your &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; screen lag might be absurd. But those aren’t big problems compared to the security that you’ve added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEZ7V8"&gt;And anyway, now that you know how to set up a VPN, toggling it off is easy in comparison. You just have to remember to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
