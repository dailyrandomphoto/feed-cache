    <title>Yes, Siri is my favorite smart home controller and here’s why</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Speed, brevity, and an abject failure at fart jokes make Apple’s AI voice assistant the winner in my smart home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WPTvnX"&gt;I use a fairly simple metric to determine which artificially intelligent voice assistant is the best for controlling my smart home: Which one do I swear at the least? Apple’s Siri, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22468274"&gt;who turns 10 today&lt;/a&gt;, wins hands down. This is slightly to do with the fact it rarely spews useless information at me when it didn’t understand what I was asking (*cough* Google) and definitely because it never asks if I want to buy something (you know who you are). But mainly, it’s because as a smart home controller, Siri is seriously fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49IGjx"&gt;Siri, you say? That same Siri whose lagginess is legendary in its native iPhone home? Yes, that’s the one. Bring Siri into your home, put the power of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517945/apple-homepod-mini-homekit-smart-home-system-gateway-price"&gt;HomePod&lt;/a&gt; (maxi or mini) behind it as a HomeKit hub, and the snappiness with which the AI does what you command will floor you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26UCCw"&gt;A simple, “Hey Siri, Good Night” turns off all the smart lights in my home, locks the front and back doors, closes the garage door, pauses any music playing, lowers the shades, and sets the thermostat to my sleep temperature in around 6 seconds, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh1Q62"&gt;A quick “Hey Siri, lights on” directed at the kitchen HomePod Mini turns just those lights on in under a second. As a bonus, it has never once accidentally illuminated the whole house at 5AM, as some other voice assistants have unhelpfully done (I mentioned the swearing already, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zORgUx"&gt;A whispered “Good Morning” into my Apple Watch while pressing the digital crown, and my home springs gently back to life; turning on just the lights I need to get ready without waking up my partner and playing NPR quietly on the kitchen Mini, all before I’ve made it out of the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="egleSZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hey, Alexa. Hey Siri. Hey Google. Hey, can anybody hear me??&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9Ac9k"&gt;Siri may lack some of the excellent qualities found on competing smart speakers.  It’s not the smartest AI — that goes to Google Assistant with its powerhouse backend. It’s not the most helpful — that goes to Alexa with its frequent (and frequently unsolicited) offers of assistance. But when all what you want to do is turn the lights on and instead your AI launches into a monologue about who invented the light switch, that’s when you say to yourself, “I wish my smart home controller was a little dumber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qaodwa"&gt;While the smart home dream is one powered by artificial intelligence that uses context to anticipate your every need, we are a long way from that reality. Today, all you really need from your smart home voice control are listening skills and comprehension — we’re talking first grade here, not a master’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdTZeY"&gt;To be helpful, voice control in the smart home just has to be easier and less obtrusive than pulling out a phone and opening an app, and more convenient than walking over to flip a switch. It’s a challenge and one that Apple is the closest to conquering — in my home at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RBU0iX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I do wish Siri was more promiscuous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sPRgrc"&gt;Yes, fart jokes are fun, and it’s great to have the world’s knowledge just a few words away — Siri is no good at either of those things. But Siri does hear me 100 percent of the time, even when the closest speaker is on the other side of the room, understands my smart home requests 95 percent of the time, and limits its chatty banter to the absolute minimum — “On it” or “Coming right up.” These are qualities I admire in a smart home controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5Q26x"&gt;However, I do wish Siri was more promiscuous. There are a fair number of gadgets and gizmos in my admittedly out-of-the-norm smart home that can’t talk to Siri. This means I occasionally find a member of my household standing haplessly in the middle of the room saying, “Hey, Alexa. Hey Siri. Hey Google. Hey, can anybody hear me??”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojs8L5"&gt;It was also not a simple nor inexpensive process to set up my partly-Siri-powered smart home. (The nature of my job means I’m contractually obliged to run all four smart voice assistants at once — yes, I have Bixby in here too). Searching for Siri-compatible devices generally means choosing the “highest-priced” filter in the search results and closing your eyes when you hit that buy button. A few more budget-friendly offerings released over the last year from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523877/aqara-smart-home-review-m2-hub-homekit-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;Aqara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.meross.com/home"&gt;Meross&lt;/a&gt; have made it a little easier on the wallet, but there are still a number of categories entirely missing or sparsely populated — such as robot vacuum cleaners, smart smoke alarms, and home security systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QZyYA5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Searching for Siri-compatible devices generally means choosing the “highest-priced” filter in the search results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvXGH3"&gt;The coming promise of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; may fix this interoperability conundrum, which, to be fair, is not just Apple’s problem. But in the meantime, I’ve found that Siri Shortcuts offers a useful way around some of these limitations. &lt;a href="https://gotailwind.com/"&gt;Tailwind, my favorite garage door controller&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t have HomeKit support for a long time. It does now, but in the interim it offered a Shortcut to program in my own command to have Siri open and close the door. The same deal with my ceiling fans. &lt;a href="https://bondhome.io/product/bond-bridge/"&gt;The Bond Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (an RF device that can communicate with a ceiling fan remote control, not a scene from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/27/22252018/james-bond-no-time-to-die-hmd-global-nokia-phones-product-placement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) can use Siri on your iPhone or Apple Watch to trigger Shortcuts to control my not smart, definitely not HomeKit-compatible fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0QLWz"&gt;The downside of Shortcuts, however, is they only work on an iPhone or Apple Watch, and smart home control needs to be easily accessible to everyone in the house, whether they’ve bought into the Apple ecosystem or not. Until the advent of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the price to outfit a modest-sized home with on-demand Siri access was prohibitive, and even the HomePod Mini’s $99 per room is still steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GniVqK"&gt;In honor of Siri’s tenth birthday, it looks like the AI is inviting some friends to the party. A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523045/apple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv"&gt;Siri-enabled accessories program&lt;/a&gt; allows non-Apple gadgets with speakers and microphones in them to relay requests to a HomePod. As of now, the Ecobee SmartThermostat is the only manufacturer to have committed to this. (Considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"&gt;Amazon just Sherlocked them with its new smart thermostat&lt;/a&gt; I wouldn’t blame Ecobee if it evicted Alexa entirely.) With more ways to talk to Siri in the home and more products that can be controlled by the smart assistant, I’m hoping my swear jar will be gathering cobwebs by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OMrqQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dyson’s next robot vacuum cleaner revealed in FCC filings with new design </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mndiPgqkNj0JdI8ClBl7UcYkBvQ=/0x5:1770x1185/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947409/new_dyson_fcc_filing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unnamed robovac has the same striking blue color as its predecessor, the Dyson 360 Heurist. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/QVHRB03001" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nt4ShT"&gt;Dyson’s last vacuum cleaner, the oddly-named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/12/17850670/dyson-robot-vacuum-360-eye-heurist"&gt;360 Heurist&lt;/a&gt;, skipped a US release, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/first-look-dyson-360-heurist-robot-wants-to-be-the-smartest-vacuum-cleaner-ever"&gt;apparently because&lt;/a&gt; its design was ill-suited to the layout of American homes. But it looks like the company is planning to launch a new robovac in the US soon, after &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/QVHRB03001"&gt;filing details of an unannounced product&lt;/a&gt; with the FCC. Photos in the filing seem to show a new design that is wider and flatter than its predecessors, with a squared-off rear and bulkier charging base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waDtrz"&gt;The unnamed robovac comes in the same striking nickel blue color as its predecessor, and has tank treads and a detachable dust bin, just like Dyson’s previous forays into this product category. It also looks like the device (labelled RB03) has the Heurist’s 360-degree camera with LED lighting ring. Those LEDs are important, as they ensure the device can navigate in the dark — handy if you want your robovac to clean when you’re out or asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT2cWq"&gt;Branding on the device suggests it will also use Dyson’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.co.uk%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fsticks%2Fdyson-hyperdymium-motor&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F10%2F4%2F22708470%2Fdyson-robot-vacuum-cleaner-us-fcc-filing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Hyperdymium motors&lt;/a&gt;. This is simply Dyson’s name for its latest brushless electric motors, which have appeared in its most recent stick vacuums. It also looks like you can remove part of the internal tubing (picture 4 below) that connects the bin to the brushes. That would be a neat upgrade, as the 360 Heurist had a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zDVl6EP42FY"&gt;tendency to clog&lt;/a&gt; when vacuuming piles of large debris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i8MKj3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10788612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VYCOid"&gt;The most interesting change for this product, though, is the new shape. Dyson’s previous vacuums, the 360 Eye and 360 Heurist, have been taller and narrower than rival products built by iRobot and the like. This allows them tighter cornering around items like chair legs, but stops them from vacuuming under some furniture. It’s hard to gauge the exact dimensions of this new product (despite the inclusion of rulers in pictures, the perspective is confusing), but it does seem to be wider and flatter than the Eye and Heurist. This would tally with Dyson’s past comments that the Heurist was not quite right for US homes. Allowing the vacuum to get under more items of furniture would certainly help with sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Clm7k9"&gt;There’s no guarantee of course that this product will end up in the US, but an FCC filing does obviously suggest that this is Dyson’s current ambition. We  expect to hear more about this product in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hey Siri, what happened?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/suDspLBgHdfFDtXFwilxVwt4Qxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947342/acastro_211001_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a decade as Apple’s assistant, Siri still hasn’t figured out the job&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XxOI1i"&gt;Ten years ago today, Apple’s digital assistant Siri was revealed with the promise that the iPhone maker had finally figured it all out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQlAfC"&gt;“For decades, technologists have teased us with this dream that you’re going to be able to talk to technology, and it’ll do things for us,” said Apple exec Phil Schiller, taking the stage at the launch of the iPhone 4s. “Haven’t we seen this before, over and over? But it never comes true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cdxm20"&gt;The problem, said Schiller, was that voice interfaces were too reliant on simple syntax. &lt;em&gt;Call&lt;/em&gt; Mom. &lt;em&gt;Dial&lt;/em&gt; 555-2368. &lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; Beethoven. “What we really want to do is just talk to our device,” he said, “and your device — in this case, your phone — will figure out what you mean and help you get what you want done.” He paused before bringing up the next slide, showing a familiar icon of a microphone cut-out in burnished aluminum. “That’s a feature on the iPhone 4s we call Siri.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YX13ru"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What we really want to do is just talk to our device,” said Schiller&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lXFa7h"&gt;Described by Schiller as a “humble personal assistant,” Siri gave 2011’s iPhone a dose of star power during a difficult time for Apple. Just months before the phone’s unveiling, a relative unknown at the company, then-chief operating officer Tim Cook, had been named CEO. The day after Schiller’s presentation, Apple’s legendary co-founder Steve Jobs would die from pancreatic cancer. Analysts were cool on the company’s prospects but praised Siri as a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/05/iphone-4s-icloud-analysts"&gt;potential game-changer&lt;/a&gt;. One called it “a powerful harbinger of the future use of mobile devices,” while another said it was “the beginning of a new user experience [for] all of Apple’s mobile and Mac products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="FOHUYM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agzItTz35QQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R75LfJ"&gt;A decade later, the sheen has worn off Siri’s star. “It is such a letdown,” was how Schiller described the promise of voice interfaces past, and such a description could easily be applied to Apple’s contribution to the genre. Everyone who uses Siri has their own tales of frustration — times when they’ve been surprised not by the intelligence but the stupidity of Apple’s assistant, when it fails to carry out a simple command or mishears a clear instruction. And while voice interfaces have indeed become widespread, Apple, despite being first to market, no longer leads. Its “humble personal assistant” remains humble indeed: inferior to Google Assistant on mobile and outmaneuvered by Amazon’s Alexa in the home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1AzJI"&gt;Looking back on a decade of development for Apple’s personal assistant, there’s one question that seems worth asking: hey Siri, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="vLyruz"&gt;The wow factor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="khQMdg"&gt;Looking back to 2011, initial reactions to Siri were incredibly positive, with reviewers impressed by the feature’s responsiveness and accuracy. “The crazy thing about Siri is that it works — at least most of the time — better than you’d expect it to,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/12/2484524/iphone-4s-review"&gt;was &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s judgment&lt;/a&gt;; “It’s kind of like having the unpaid intern of my dreams at my beck and call,” &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/12/tech/mobile/review-siri-iphone-voice-wired/index.html"&gt;said &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; “Siri saves time, fumbling and distraction, and profoundly changes the definition of ‘phone,’” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/technology/personaltech/iphone-4s-conceals-sheer-magic-pogue.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=technology"&gt;said &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All in all: Apple seemed to be living up to its promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TLsF1"&gt;But reading these reviews now, it’s clear Siri was graded on a curve. Its novelty and ambition invited generous appraisals, but when reviewers noted frustrations, they caveated that the software was only in beta and that any rough patches would surely be smoothed away in due time. A &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/10/iphone-4s-a-siri-ously-slick-speedy-smartphone/"&gt;detailed run-down of Siri in 2011 from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; highlights problems familiar today, with the assistant dinged for mishearing instructions in loud spaces and mangling complex commands. An instruction to “Send a text to Jason, Clint, Sam, and Lee saying we’re having dinner at Silver Cloud” is interpreted with Siri texting Jason: “Clint Sam and Lee saying we’re having dinner at Silver Cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="MYZdcd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Siri was first on the scene, but soon was just part of the chorus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q860Aj"&gt;Siri had a first-mover advantage, but it didn’t take long for rivals to emerge. Samsung introduced S Voice on the Galaxy S3 in 2012; that same year Google Now was launched for Android (replaced by Google Assistant in 2016); in 2014 Microsoft brought out Cortana for Windows Phone; and also that year, Amazon went its own way by introducing customers to Alexa on the Echo smart speaker. Speaking to your computer quickly became an expected feature not just on mobile devices, but a whole range of gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="galXfv"&gt;Looking through reviews and comparisons of digital assistants in this period, two things stick out. The first is that people soon get bored of Siri. As reviewers tackle iPhones after the 4s, they often note incremental updates to the assistant but never dedicate much space to it its features. Partly, this seems just because the changes are so small (e.g., retrieving sports results in iOS 6; integrating Wikipedia in iOS 7; introducing ‘Hey, Siri’ in iOS 8), but also because the novelty has worn off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0N0ZfW"&gt;By the time we get to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/technology/iphone-reviews.html"&gt;reviews of the iPhone 8&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, Siri is mentioned in passing, if at all. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017"&gt;Our own review&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the assistant’s contribution in a single line: “Siri sounds a lot nicer as well, although it’s not any more capable than before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 4S Siri" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e36FE_zxFYAre8sm8lY_SbNQCE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/938847/iPhone_4S_Siri_1020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siri on the iPhone 4s impressed reviewers for its sheer novelty. But Apple never kept up the momentum. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPA8NE"&gt;The second major trend is that once competitors did arrive, Apple’s advantage evaporated quickly. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/24/3040552/siri-vs-s-voice-comparison-video"&gt;comparison of Siri and Samsung’s S Voice&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 notes that the latter already “offers a very good approximation” of Apple’s digital assistant, while a head-to-head test in 2014 shows that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/9/6951813/google-now-crushes-siri-and-cortana"&gt;Google Now crushes Siri&lt;/a&gt;.” By 2017, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15655558/google-assistant-vs-siri-iphone-ios-apple-locked-down-sandbox"&gt;noted that&lt;/a&gt; Siri “feels largely half-baked,” and a dissatisfaction with digital assistants in general had begun to creep in. We point out that these assistants can answer basic questions just fine but fail to reliably &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things for the user — like booking cinema tickets or ordering food. At least, not without creating new problems of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL13Qf"&gt;Looking back, it’s clear that Siri’s big problem is that it failed to maintain momentum. The basic roster of tasks that made Apple’s digital assistant so appealing in 2011 — setting alarms, taking notes, and so on — were never significantly expanded upon. The ability to answer trivia questions and retrieve sport scores is fun, but not as significant an upgrade as telling a computer to complete tasks using just your voice. Meanwhile, rivals replicated and then exceeded what Siri could do. They began to offer more reliable dictation, better language understanding, and integration with third-party skills. Siri just didn’t keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lsd4sf"&gt;Trouble at the top&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xLN0Rx"&gt;So, where did things go wrong? How did Apple lose its lead? The answer is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdKpJv"&gt;Many suggest Apple’s dedication to privacy means it can never keep up with rivals like Google whose business involves collecting users’ data because that data is incredibly useful when it comes to improving AI systems. I don’t buy this as a reason for Siri’s failure, though. First, because Apple’s love of user privacy is far from absolute. (In 2019, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that “a small proportion” of Siri recordings were being passed to contractors for analysis, with a whistleblower claiming they overhead discussions “between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on.”) And secondly, because Apple is a two-trillion-dollar company. If it wants to circumvent the messy problems of collecting user data, it can, simply by paying to generate this data. Yes, analyzing random Siri interactions is helpful, but there are other ways to achieve the same improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BJ0NiG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When Steve died the day after Siri launched, they lost the vision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wABLGp"&gt;A more convincing explanation is management dysfunction. In 2018, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-seven-year-itch-how-apples-marriage-to-siri-turned-sour"&gt;published a damning report&lt;/a&gt; on the comings-and-goings at team Siri. It noted that there was deep-seated disagreement within the company about how Siri should work (is it a feature focused on search and retrieval, or an assistant that carries out complex tasks?). These disagreements stemmed back to Jobs’ original plans for Siri but had devolved into “petty turf battles and heated arguments” between rival factions. They were exacerbated by a lack of leadership and continuity in the Apple execs overseeing Siri. As one former employee told &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;: “When Steve died the day after Siri launched, they lost the vision [...] They didn’t have a big picture.” This tallies with the feature’s stalled development after its initial launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZANm6e"&gt;Other problems are rooted in Apple’s ideology of technology development. For example, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s report claims that Apple exec Richard Williamson made the decision to only update Siri once a year, following the company’s cadence of new hardware and iOS updates. This seems to have slowed progress. (Williamson, who refuted this claim, left Apple in 2012 after spearheading the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/20/3363914/wrong-turn-apple-ios-6-maps-phone-5-buggy-complaints"&gt;disastrous Apple Maps launch&lt;/a&gt;. Scott Forstall, another executive involved in Siri and Apple Maps, &lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/509277/today-in-apple-history-scott-forstall-forced-out-of-apple/"&gt;departed that same year&lt;/a&gt;. Read into that what you will.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJvTNr"&gt;There’s also Apple’s walled garden approach, which means Siri has always worked well with iOS features but played badly with third-party services. While testing Siri in preparation for this story, I was consistently surprised by its failure to execute simple tasks on popular iOS apps. Siri can’t send a voice memo on WhatsApp; can’t post a story to Instagram; can’t record a run on RunKeeper; and can’t open up &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; crossword. Sure, some of the blame for this lack of interoperability lies with outside developers, but it’s also Apple’s job to encourage such functionality through toolkits and the like. The company certainly doesn’t lead by example, either. When I ask Siri for information I know is stored in iOS, like “show me photos from last August,” it just performs an image search for the phrase “last August.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_CDKU4S2TXG2fNJS-ekOGHqWCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22893700/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_4.04.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not close, and no cigar: results when you ask Siri to “show me photos from last August.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WnyGFp"&gt;Instead, Apple uses Siri to herd people back to its own inferior apps like a shepherd directing sheep off a cliff-face. If I ask Siri for directions, it prompts me to reinstall Apple Maps (when I habitually use Google Maps and Citymapper). If I try to send an email to my boss, Siri tells me, “I’m sorry I can’t do that,” and then directs me to the App Store to download Apple’s default mail app (I use Outlook). And, here’s a sign of how slipshod Siri’s development is right now: when this happens, Siri sets up a search for “mobilemail” on the App Store. This, of course, isn’t the name of Apple’s mail app, but an ID used by iOS developers, and so it draws a blank when you search for it on the App Store. That’s the kind of broken functionality you get when a company isn’t thoroughly testing its own product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L0wtM"&gt;This last point, though, highlights a problem particular not just to Apple’s assistant, but to voice interfaces more generally, and that is one of &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="belhu2"&gt;When Schiller introduced Siri in 2011, he stressed time and time again that Siri would understand users — that it knows what they are saying, just like a real person. This set the bar too high for Siri’s functionality. If you treat voice interfaces as if they have the same level of fluency and knowledge as a human being, you will always be disappointed. We speak, and they stumble. We guess what they’re capable of, and they disappoint. Usually because they don’t support the app or command we thought they would. Each failed interaction then teaches users: &lt;em&gt;don’t trust this feature&lt;/em&gt;. By comparison, screens and displays tell us clearly what we can and cannot do. They offer menus, directions, and buttons. A voice offers only itself and our projections of intelligence. For Siri, users have been guided by Apple’s flair for the theatrical. They expect too much, and Apple delivers too little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="24pjSv"&gt;The future of voice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ8jBr"&gt;Here’s a true story. I took a break just now from writing this article to make a cup of tea and remembered that I had a meeting in an hour’s time. Worried it might slip my mind, I did what I often do in these situations: I asked Siri to set a reminder. “Siri, remind me at ten to five that I have a call,” I said. “Okay,” said Siri, “Setting a reminder for tomorrow at five: you have a call.” I tried again. This time Siri created a reminder for ten o’clock in the evening. The third time, I paused mid-command, trying to think of a clearer way to word my query. Siri got tired of waiting and beeped at me: “What do you want me to remind you of?” And at that, I gave up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xfCE77"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple can’t afford to give up on Siri&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1xMve"&gt;It’s true that Siri and its ilk are often disappointing, but they still tempt users because they hold great potential. Despite the problems associated with voice interfaces, the technology represents a genuine advance. I regularly use Siri for quick tasks, like taking notes, setting timers, and making searches. And when it works, it works seamlessly and unthinkingly. It’s a genuine time-saver. Siri can do much more, too, especially if you’re willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704860/siri-best-smart-home-voice-assistant-editorial"&gt;dive into the world of Apple Shortcuts and smart home commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWPvuM"&gt;As an accessibility tool, voice controls and dictation have opened up modern gadgets to many more users, and since Apple introduced Siri in 2011, the company has launched a number of products that rely heavily on voice. This is either because screen real estate is limited (the Apple Watch) or it’s nonexistent (the AirPods and HomePod). In years to come, we can expect Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt; to be added to this list. With this in mind, Apple urgently needs to fix Siri — not ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7tmRQiWXwOhvqxy7gSrUc-vv5eI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993026/akrales_190327_3315_0182.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirPods, HomePod, and Apple Watch — all products where Siri is helpful or essential. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lSIjso"&gt;If you want to be optimistic, then there are some signs the company is turning the ship around. AI, in general, has received much more attention from Apple in recent years. From poaching Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri"&gt;head of machine learning in 2018&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/13/16300464/apple-iphone-x-ai-neural-engine"&gt;designing its own AI processors&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21301511/apple-ai-machine-learning-features-wwdc-2020-convenience"&gt;regular launch of AI-enhanced features&lt;/a&gt;, the company is clearly paying more attention to the field. And, best of all, Siri itself has seen a few significant improvements, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;on-device processing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523045/apple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv"&gt;availability on third-party hardware&lt;/a&gt; added this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Di1z2J"&gt;I’m still skeptical, though. For a start, even when it comes to basic commands, it often seems Siri is not just standing still but moving backward. With iOS 15, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/352142/ios-15-siri-third-party-app-integrations-deprecated.html"&gt;removed a decent chunk of Siri’s functionality&lt;/a&gt;, including tasks related to notes and photos, and third-party integrations like ride-hailing and payments. Other basic commands, like checking voicemail, also seem &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/users-complain-about-siri-no-longer-being-able-to-send-email-and-check-call-history/"&gt;to have recently disappeared&lt;/a&gt; (whether temporarily or not isn’t clear). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdqcXC"&gt;The big problem, I think, is that Apple still doesn’t know what it wants Siri to be. Is the feature simply a way to control your phone with your voice — letting you navigate apps and find content? Or is it something more ambitious — an actual assistant capable of carrying out complex tasks on your behalf? Apple tends to present Siri as the latter in marketing materials, while users find its functionality limited to the former. As someone who reports on AI and machine learning, I think we’re still many, many years away from building computers that truly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; us. Language is just too complex, too deeply rooted in human experience and culture, to be brute-forced by the sort of statistical models we’re throwing at the problem. And while, yes, there are lots of impressive new language systems out there, none of them are reliable enough to create a flawless digital assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="D5vLZ1"&gt;If Apple wants to salvage Siri, I think it needs to reset expectations and focus on core competencies instead. It’s interesting to compare Siri’s launch with that of its competitors. When Google introduced &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/snL88L1DQQ4"&gt;Google Assistant in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the focus was less on solving complex tasks and understanding users’ every whim, and more on making the company’s basic search functionality accessible in more places. It was a tighter focus that gave Google the space to surprise, rather than disappoint. (Though the company has certainly over-promised in later ads, too.) Siri, by comparison, surprised us all when it launched in 2011, but has since burned out that goodwill. Apple needs to re-focus on the basics rather than push into a future that doesn’t yet exist. It needs to start listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJPM0M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple finally lets you report App Store scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MSLXmSgAgFbhRM3vT8eiqNXDfn8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947070/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2QeKQk"&gt;One month ago, we laid out a list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;eight obvious things Apple could do&lt;/a&gt; to prove it puts App Store users ahead of profits. Today I learned the company acted on at least one of these ideas: Apple will now let you directly report a scammy app from its listing in the App Store with a new-and-improved version of its “Report a Problem” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8UELa"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mazkewich/status/1444780501949194256"&gt;Richard Mazkewich&lt;/a&gt; and scam hunter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1444801938990657536"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; point out on Twitter, the button has not only returned to individual app listings for the first time in years, it now includes a dedicated “Report a scam or fraud” option in the drop-down menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OagmtA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In a major reversal, Apple quietly added back the “Report a Problem” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; button in iOS 15: &lt;a href="https://t.co/UopiPDEV7e"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UopiPDEV7e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1444814469184425988?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BuSUQB"&gt;Until iOS 15, the only way you could find this button was to scroll &lt;em&gt;all the way down to the bottom&lt;/em&gt; of the Apps or Games tab in the App Store, get kicked out to a website where you’d need to re-sign in. Then you could pick from “Report suspicious activity,” “Report a quality issue”, “Request a refund” or “Find my content.” None of the options offered a clear way to report a scam, and the “Report suspicious activity” would redirect you to Apple Support instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV3tFU"&gt;To add insult to injury, Apple would only let you report “a quality issue” if you’d already paid money (and thus fallen for the scam). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dvpc1F"&gt;But now, it seems like every free app with in-app-purchases appears to offer the “Report a Problem” option. I checked a handful of apps I’ve never paid for (but could have) and they all displayed the button. You’ll still get kicked out to a website where you’ll need to sign in, but overall this seems like a step forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7pUYa5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is Apple actually hiring scam investigators?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aIfpkS"&gt;Of course, the big question is whether Apple will actually take action on those reports. Another thing we pointed out last month is that Apple only has 500 human app reviewers — compared to 15,000 content moderators at Facebook, 20,000 at Google, and, yes, 2,200 at Twitter (a company &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; from the most valuable and profitable in the world). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aabRXO"&gt;Intriguingly, there may be some movement on that front too: Eleftheriou pointed out to me that Apple began hiring &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mi2lnsb96ikJ:https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200284943/asi-investigator&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;strip=1&amp;amp;vwsrc=0"&gt;for an “ASI Investigator” position on September 8th&lt;/a&gt;. “ASI Investigators are accountable for investigating fraudulent apps and trends, as well as the developers involved,” part of the job posting read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvTqX3"&gt;Shame that job posting no longer exists; it’s been taken down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9LPlp"&gt;Perhaps, at the very least, Apple’s automated systems can use the new data to sound the alarm when a scam app crosses a predefined threshold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJYUny"&gt;Apple definitely seems to be listening to the recent wave of anger around the App Store. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;a variety of small forced concessions&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of judicial and regulatory scrutiny, Apple just &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/"&gt;started allowing users to review the company’s own apps that it bundles with every iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. Apple Podcasts, Weather, and even the built in Calculator app are all fair game for angry 1-star reviews. Immunity from user scrutiny may not be the most egregious advantage Apple has enjoyed in its own App Store, but it’s nice to see the company leveling the playing field even a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqRb8Q"&gt;Here are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;the other suggestions&lt;/a&gt; we had for Apple’s App Store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;a brief history of significant policy changes&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s made over the years. Yes, we’re keeping track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZZXZth"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store is too big to change","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22645070/apple-app-store-policies-purchases-cut-fees-change-class-action"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon Prime members can now send gifts with just a phone number or email address</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dLXvTD1FaGABeSBtm_-SKzsy7A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947040/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon Prime members can now send gifts without having the recipient’s address. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rT0ri"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/node=23555099011#nav-top"&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; a new gifting feature today that will allow subscribers to its Prime service to send gifts to others using only an email address or phone number — no address required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q5zBt"&gt;Gift-givers have to be Amazon Prime members, the program is limited to the continental US, and it can only be used on mobile devices for the time being. And even though Amazon has built in some safeguards— the gift-giver never gets access to the recipient’s mailing address— this sounds like a bad idea that is ripe for abuse by scammers, stalkers, and those who take pleasure in the online harassment of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yvf6b5"&gt;Here’s how the new feature works: Gift-giver wants to surprise recipient with a present but doesn’t know recipient’s mailing address. Gift-giver does, however, have either recipient’s email address or phone number. Gift-giver chooses the gift on his Amazon mobile app, selects the “add gift receipt for easy returns” options during check-out, and will see an option to “let the recipient provide their address.” The giver then adds the recipient’s email address or mobile number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxDoAg"&gt;At this point the gift-giver’s card isn’t charged, but a hold is put on their payment card for the amount of the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYh34W"&gt;Recipient then gets a notice —via either a text message or email— that there’s a present from gift-giver waiting for her.  Note that if recipient doesn’t have an Amazon account, they can create one at this point. The recipient has to have an Amazon account to accept the gift, but only the giver has to be a Prime member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPfRF2"&gt;The recipient can click on the notice from Amazon to reveal what the gift-giver sent, then she can decide whether to decline the gift, accept the gift but convert it to an Amazon gift card—the gift giver won’t be notified— or, she can just accept the gift. If the recipient accepts the gift, the giver’s payment card is charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A4VIX"&gt;If the recipient ignores the gift notification entirely, it expires within a few days, and the gift-giver gets his money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ctcIIz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WbaD-dl83cg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=95&amp;amp;start=95" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zjz2hz"&gt;I asked Amazon if there was a mechanism for its members to opt out of this new service; there is not. Amazon’s stance is that if the recipient doesn’t want the gift, they can just decline it, or ignore the notification. What’s to stop a troll/harasser/stalker from sending multiple gifts to a recipient just to spam them with notifications, when the giver knows the recipient won’t accept? Technically nothing, although the recipient could notify Amazon customer service, which will decide what action to take. Such behavior would appear to violate Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=help_search_1-2&amp;amp;nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF&amp;amp;qid=1633180599372&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUxuRu"&gt;Not everything Amazon sells is eligible for the new gifting feature, but “millions” of items are, the company said. The eligible items include products sold by Amazon and third-party sellers on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhUYs5"&gt;This is a clever feature from Amazon that will theoretically drum up more members; remember, you can’t accept a gift through this process without an Amazon account. It’s well-timed, too; the holiday shopping season is approaching and we’re already hearing warnings about &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/germanys-christmas-king-gets-caught-up-in-shipping-chaos-11632475801"&gt;shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; and supply shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPiZmX"&gt;But the idea of getting a gift from someone who doesn’t have your address is problematic; there may be a very good reason the recipient’s address isn’t known to the gift-giver. If someone spams your phone or your inbox with multiple gift alerts, even if you don’t accept them or decline them, it will be up to the recipient to notify Amazon of the problem. Theoretically, since Prime members register their names, addresses and a payment method with Amazon, they wouldn’t risk having their account revoked by sending fake gifts. This is hardly a foolproof method for preventing harassment, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6d9JM"&gt;Amazon says it will roll out this feature over the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLEPDL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook encourages hate speech for profit, says whistleblower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_GB8DFDxs2V5EqaZTlvK8KyrDD0=/387x0:2388x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69946435/7CF1506A_B241_40D9_9565_05E4C77C2DC7.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen appears on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjQkgB"&gt;The whistleblower behind the leak of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;an enormous cache of Facebook documents&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Frances Haugen, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/"&gt;went public on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, revealing more of the inner workings the most powerful social media platform in the world. Revealing her identity on national television, Haugen described a company so committed to product optimization that it embraced algorithms that amplify hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNTay4"&gt;“It’s paying for its profits with our safety,” Haugen told &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; host Scott Pelley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4boPU"&gt;According to a since deleted LinkedIn profile Haugen was a product manager at Facebook assigned to the Civic Integrity group. She chose to leave the company in 2021 after the dissolving of the group. She said she didn’t “trust that they’re willing to invest what actually needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5cFvGm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was conflict... between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PV1Jdl"&gt;Consequently she leaked a cache of internal research to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the hopes of driving better regulation of the company. She noted that she had worked at a number of companies, including Google and Pinterest, but that “it was substantially worse at Facebook” due to the company’s desire to put its profits over the welfare of its users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJrYKb"&gt;“There was conflict... between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” Haugen told Pelley, “and Facebook chose over and over again to optimize for its own interests — like making more money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSIrpG"&gt;While the company repeatedly claims it is helping stop hate speech, at least on its own products, one internal Facebook document leaked by Haugen says, “We estimate that we may action as little as 3-5% of hate and ~0.6% of V&amp;amp;I [Violence and Incitement] on Facebook despite being the best in the world at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ruHTer"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” said an internal document&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4KuvT"&gt;Another document was even more blunt. “We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ4FXB"&gt;Haugen claims the root of the problem is the algorithims rolled out in 2018 that govern what you see on the platform. According to her they are meant to drive engagement and the company has found that the best engagement is the kind instilling fear and hate in users. “Its easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,” Hagen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfYOL5"&gt;At the time, Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions"&gt;presented the algorithm changes as positive&lt;/a&gt;. “We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaTR4c"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting on Haugen’s concerns, the result was a sharp turn towards anger and hate. “Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” said one internal memo quoted by the Journal, assessing the effects of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITqMKf"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; began publishing its findings from the cache under the name “The Facebook Files” in September. One report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;alleging Facebook had research proving Instagram harmed teenage girls&lt;/a&gt; has since led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;. Ahead of the hearing Facebook attempted to change the narrative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, which reproduced two of the reports referred to in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irvkLs"&gt;Ahead of the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; report, Facebook attempted the same deflections in a different form. Facebook Vice President of Global Affair Nick Clegg appeared on CNN’s &lt;em&gt;Reliable Sources&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ReliableSources/status/1444730430461251585?s=20"&gt;to defend the company&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday afternoon, just hours before Haugen would appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsEpXw"&gt;“I think that’s ludicrous,” Clegg said of the allegation that social media was responsible for the January 6 riots. “I think it gives people false comfort to assume that there must be a technological, or technical, explanation for the issues of political polarization in the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bkYb9"&gt;Haugen ended the interview by calling for regulation of social networks more broadly, something Facebook itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/19/21142478/facebook-regulation-content-moderation-singapore-pakistan"&gt;has called for&lt;/a&gt; in more limited form. She is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/facebook-whistleblower-testify-us-senate-hearing-next-week-lawmakers-say-2021-09-29/"&gt;scheduled to appear before a Senate Commerce&lt;/a&gt; panel on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Eternals, Welcome to Earth, The Girl in the Woods, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9rfnfdYaZO_96uwjg-qkqoGrPD0=/371x0:1546x783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69945868/eternals.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eternals comes to theaters November 5th | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHpUqVktG74&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6bQzf"&gt;So we had the big heel turn that’s been hinted at all season, plus some big moments for two of the show’s couples, which made &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s penultimate episode of season two very stressful to watch (for me, at least). I have no idea how they will wrap it all up in the finale; I think we’re headed for a cliffhanger on at least one front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93QeWc"&gt;There’s too much good on streaming right now, it’s really a nice problem to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSAITj"&gt;Here’s this week’s trailers roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJ7tMu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHpUqVktG74?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pBbLLZ"&gt;Eternals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2cqgG"&gt;A brand-new trailer for Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; has some of the action sequences we’ve seen in prior teaser/trailers, plus, a first look at Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, along with his husband and son, apparently the first queer couple in the MCU to appear on the big screen (h/t &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Poc55U2RPMw&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for that detail). To recap: The&lt;em&gt; Eternals&lt;/em&gt; are mega-hero guardians who have been waiting to jump in and help humanity and have decided the time is now. Also starring Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, and Kit Harington, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxgnYe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0MTCXgil1M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="THroja"&gt;Welcome to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6gnhiT"&gt;Will Smith opens this trailer with a confession: he’s never climbed a mountain or swum in a lake and is beginning to think he might be missing something. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Earth&lt;/em&gt; is a six-part series from National Geographic— with its usual stunning location photography— that follows Smith on a trip around the world to some out-of-the-way places. It arrives on Disney Plus In December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDXFqP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKJOsy3Kf18?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PjMonH"&gt;Sexy Beasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="a60CKY"&gt;This ... unusual dating show where people wear elaborate animal/monster/creature costumes and makeup to hide their looks from potential suitors so they can be judged only on their personalities is back for a second season for some reason. The trailer leans all the way in to the weirdness, using &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/7/21/22587027/sexy-beasts-netflix"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/06/netflixs-sexy-beasts-is-a-dating-show-fever-dream.html"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; like “A sign of the end times” and “the stuff of nightmares, truly,” which sort of begs the question: did we really need a second season? Clearly Netflix thought so. Season two of &lt;em&gt;Sexy Beasts&lt;/em&gt; premieres October 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="knrChD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7MudPmb8s8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oJKX6o"&gt;The Girl in the Woods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dDEU0V"&gt;A girl in the Pacific Northwest escapes from a colony of mysterious people who live behind a door in the woods, and guard the world from monsters. Krysten Ritter signed on to direct some episodes of the series, which stars Stefanie Scott, Misha Osherovich, Sofia Bryant Will Yun Lee, Reed Diamond, and Leonard Roberts. &lt;em&gt;The Girl in The Woods &lt;/em&gt;comes to Peacock October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZoZcTY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Poc55U2RPMw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2ytEGa"&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="goxsb0"&gt;We got a teaser for this western about rival outlaw gangs back in June, but here’s our first official trailer and a release date for the impossibly star-studded &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall. &lt;/em&gt;We get a little more backstory for Nat Love and why he’s gunning (literally) for Rufus Buck, who just broke out of a train car where he was imprisoned. Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, Idris Elba, Delroy Lindo, Damon Wayans, Jr. and Regina King star in&lt;em&gt; The Harder They Fall,&lt;/em&gt; coming to Netflix November 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Ocxy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Europe-Japan mission to Mercury sends back photos of the planet’s cratered surface</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q7ZgZtt25Cm3_ktf6aJNgys4Fe8=/3x85:1021x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69945193/Hello_Mercury.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BepiColombo mission snapped this photo of Mercury on October 1st. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2021/10/Hello_Mercury" target="_blank"&gt;ESA/BepiColombo/MTM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3n2YD0"&gt;Photos from a fly-by of Mercury, the least-explored planet in our solar system, show ithas a crater-riddled surface that resembles Earth’s Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeTle2"&gt;The photos came from BepiColombo, a joint mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) that launched from Europe’s Spaceport in 2018. The mission has two linked orbiting spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter. The mission is planned to reach Mercury’s orbit in late 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZD0PR"&gt;BepiColombo aims to gather more information about Mercury and its composition, and how it evolved so close to our Sun. Temperatures on Mercury can exceed 350 degrees Celsius, or about 660 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fazrvd"&gt;ESA explains where the craters came from and what the surface of the planet is believed to be like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VOxC8w"&gt;One theory is that it may have begun as a larger body that was then stripped of most of its rock by a giant impact. This left it with a relatively large iron core, where its magnetic field is generated, and only a thin rocky outer shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqRKtU"&gt;Mercury has no equivalent to the ancient bright lunar highlands: its surface is dark almost everywhere, and was formed by vast outpourings of lava billions of years ago. These lava flows bear the scars of craters formed by asteroids and comets crashing onto the surface at speeds of tens of kilometers per hour. The floors of some of the older and larger craters have been flooded by younger lava flows, and there are also more than a hundred sites where volcanic explosions have ruptured the surface from below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="b6HoXH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello, Mercury!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This splendid view of part of Mercury's northern hemisphere was captured by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ESA_MTM?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ESA_MTM&lt;/a&gt; about 10 mins after &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MercuryFlyby?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MercuryFlyby&lt;/a&gt; close approach, from a distance of 2420km. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jjGKrsQXDH"&gt;https://t.co/jjGKrsQXDH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExploreFarther?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ExploreFarther&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EMhMJ5tKiN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EMhMJ5tKiN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bepi (@ESA_Bepi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ESA_Bepi/status/1444218331595169795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bLq88W"&gt;BepiColombo is named for Italian scientist &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESA_history/Giuseppe_Bepi_Colombo_Grandfather_of_the_fly-by"&gt;Giuseppe “Bepi” Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, who helped develop the gravity assist procedure that the first spacecraft sent to Mercury, NASA’s Mariner 10, used in 1974. The fly-bys allow the spacecraft to use Mercury’s gravity to enter the planet’s orbit. Friday’s fly-by of Mercury was the first of six planned before it enters the planet’s orbit for closer study. BepiColombo will also build on data collected by NASA’s Messenger mission, which orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM7if1"&gt;As the spacecraft get closer to Mercury, it will be able to take higher-res images. More images from Friday’s fly-by will be available in the coming days, ESA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gICFi4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SNL says what we were all thinking in its billionaire Star Trek sketch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Launch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpoIbEfAhiAwUAVP76_nr0eZx9k=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69944523/1329693390.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft lifts off from the launch pad on July 20th. | Photo by Joe Raedle / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omwaS7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; returned this weekend and the show wasted no time taking aim at the weird &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;billionaire space tourism race&lt;/a&gt; that unfolded over the past few months. Guest host Owen Wilson played former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a sketch about a fictional new show called &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Ego Quest, &lt;/em&gt;about “the voyages of the SS New Shepard and its crew of random weirdos,” whose mission is “to just sort of fly around space goofing off in a ship that looks like a penis,” according to the voiceover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5lNg4"&gt;You’ll recall the real &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22580542/jeff-bezos-space-launch-live-stream-time-date-blue-origin-ns16-new-shepard"&gt;Bezos traveled to the edge&lt;/a&gt; of space in Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket in July, along with a crew that included his brother Mark (played in the sketch by Wilson’s brother Luke), 82-year-old pilot and space legend Wally Funk, and Dutch high school student Oliver Daemen. But Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin Galactic, beat Bezos to space by few days when he took a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;trip aboard his company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22667339/spacex-inspiration4-first-all-civilian-crew-dragon"&gt;SpaceX sent its first crew of private citizens&lt;/a&gt; into space earlier this month, but CEO Elon Musk didn’t join them for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOT9c7"&gt;In the SNL sketch, Branson (Alex Moffatt), flying nearby in a ship with purple mood lighting, challenges Bezos to a race after they exchange some standard bro greetings for a flight the voiceover refers to as “a midlife crisis of cosmic proportions,” in which they accidentally wreck into the international space station. But wait, danger lurks around every corner: Suddenly Bezos’ ship is being pelted by photon torpedoes and yes of course it’s Elon Musk (Mikey Day, doing a spot-on impression of Musk’s speaking style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKZQnW"&gt; “Space is only big enough for one white, weird billionaire,” “Musk” tells “Bezos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zW9Gdf"&gt;In reality, of course, neither Bezos or Musk has had much of a sense of humor about the other’s space aspirations. “You cannot sue your way to the moon,” the real &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699254/musk-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-code-confernce-2021"&gt;Musk told journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; in an interview last week while discussing Bezos and Blue Origin. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700600/amazon-elon-musk-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-spacex-lawsuits"&gt;Amazon sent&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; a 13-page PDF&lt;/a&gt; list that included all the times SpaceX has filed lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqrH5Z"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; sketch took one last jab at Bezos before it wrapped: an Amazon employee (Kenan Thompson) beams aboard Bezos’ ship to deliver a package, and before he beams out asks to use the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2WSvh"&gt;Wilson-as-Bezos tosses him a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;plastic bottle.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford and GM working toward settlement over the term ‘Cruise’ for hands-free driving</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="brMA7O"&gt;Ford and General Motors told a federal judge they’re planning to settle a trademark battle over the term “Cruise” to describe hands-free driving. Attorneys for the automakers said they’re working out the terms of the settlement and &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22897484/cruise_vs_ford_settlement_notice.pdf"&gt;asked the court for a conditional dismissa&lt;/a&gt;l. The two sides will report back within 60 days if they’re unable to come to an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEsNfw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist feature in April. The legal skirmish began in July, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591805/gm-cruise-lawsuit-trademark-infringement-hands-free-driving-autonomous"&gt;GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the name BlueCruise was too close to its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise, as well as Super Cruise, the name of the hands-free driving tech GM introduced in 2017.  GM said in its complaint that the two the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to come to agreement. GM said it introduced Super Cruise in 2012, and its Cruise self-driving subsidiary has been in business since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0yuxU"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/14/22624945/ford-dismiss-cruise-gm-lawsuit-driver-assist-blue-cruise"&gt;Ford filed a motion&lt;/a&gt; to have the suit dismissed, arguing that the term “cruise” had been been in “ubiquitous use” for 50 years as a term for driver-assist features, a term that consumers don’t associate with any one carmaker. A Ford spokesperson called GM’s trademark claims “meritless and frivolous,” adding that Ford had petitioned the US Patent and Trademark Office seeking to have GM’s trademarks of “Cruise” and “SuperCruise” rescinded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXvDjy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLGqQG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
