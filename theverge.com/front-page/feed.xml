    <title>A short history of every time Apple CEO Tim Cook praised augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFSuuOJCdScY2AnKMm3g_j2QVS4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848232/tim-cook-apple-stock-0563.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cook has been singing the praises of AR for five years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ERzUQ0"&gt;Tim Cook has just marked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;10 years as Apple’s CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and while he’s grown Apple into the most valuable company in the world, it’s reasonable to argue he hasn’t yet introduced a signature, industry shaking product like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs did with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqO7Qo"&gt;But if you’ve been following Apple for a minute, you’ve probably heard Cook talk about the game-changing potential of augmented reality. While he once said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/28/4374482/tim-cook-apple-wearable-google-glass"&gt;hard to see the appeal of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;, the AR wearable that proved unpopular with consumers, he’s held a consistently positive opinion on AR since at least 2016. While most of the industry was putting all its eggs in the VR basket, Cook repeatedly expressed support for what he views as the far superior AR. This would become a running theme: AR good, VR not so good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3j429"&gt;It seems likely that AR may become the hallmark of Cook’s tenure, as long as Apple executes on a winning idea. While that’s not exactly guaranteed — Apple has yet to unveil an AR headset or glasses — Cook’s frequent comments about the tech keep the topic in the news and reassure investors and customers that Apple is working on it. In September 2021, he went as far as to call himself “AR fan number one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZIIDx"&gt;AR features are already available on the iPhone and iPad. And while hope is starting to fade that Apple will release a mixed reality device in 2022, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;latest rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is still forging ahead with some kind of AR / VR headset to be released in the not-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jIE1"&gt;Here’s a brief history of all the times Tim Cook said he was convinced AR was the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LR10VY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook says in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12290920/apple-augmented-reality-ar-tim-cook"&gt;quarterly earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that “AR can be really great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wX7rQO"&gt;“We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run, we think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. The number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ kind of products like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, that’s why you see so many iPhones in the wild chasing pokemons.” (Cook pronounces it “pokey-mans.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3BaXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913"&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that he believes AR is a bigger deal than VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtE9kB"&gt;“There’s virtual reality and there’s augmented reality — both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEwdho"&gt;AR “gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things — visually — for both of us to see. Maybe it’s something we’re talking about, maybe it’s someone else here who’s not here present but who can be made to appear to be present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB8GUn"&gt;“There’s a lot of really cool things there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvA1V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook makes a brief mention of AR in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2016/08/13/tim-cook-the-interview-running-apple-is-sort-of-a-lonely-job/?utm_term=.71cfafb58188"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;: “I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfFqeu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016: &lt;/strong&gt;In an appearance at Utah Tech Tour, Cook goes into detail about &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/02/tim-cook-talks-steve-jobs-need-for-encryption-at-utah-tech-tour-video/"&gt;how crucial AR may become&lt;/a&gt; and why he views it as superior to VR — while stressing that AR presents significant technology challenges before it can be adopted for mass consumerism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="s4U9pW"&gt;In terms of it becoming a mass adoption [phenomenon], so that, say, everyone in here would have an AR experience, the reality to do that, it has to be something that everyone in here views to be an “acceptable thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE5O2T"&gt;And nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyxSDF"&gt;I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you, a lot of us live on our smartphones, the iPhone, I hope, is very important for everyone, so AR will become really big. VR I think is not going to be that big, compared to AR. I’m not saying it’s not important, it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mfq3v"&gt;I’m excited about VR from an education point of view, I think it can be really big for education, I think it can be very big for games. But I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me. But I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now, if the technology was there, which it’s not today. How long will it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx2VTE"&gt;AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there. But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="o5nJLd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkV78RZ73Mw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ivZT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; Cook &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-virtual-reality-theres-no-substitute-f#.qel1aEjdb"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that while “VR has some interesting applications,” AR is superior to VR because “there’s no substitute for human contact. And so you want the technology to encourage that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LWV7WX"&gt;Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8zwWMG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2017: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html"&gt;expands his thoughts on AR’s potential&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new comparison: AR is a big idea, like the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qlZDkX"&gt;I’m excited about augmented reality because unlike virtual reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHlQnM"&gt;I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ywuu2K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-15/apple-s-tim-cook-on-donald-trump-the-homepod-and-the-legacy-of-steve-jobs"&gt;wide-ranging interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook details his vision for AR at Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b2MVpL"&gt;I think it is profound. I am so excited about it, I just want to yell out and scream. The first step in making it a mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating system. We’re building it into iOS 11, opening it to ­developers—and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we can’t predict what’s going to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5fDe2"&gt;There’s some things that you can already get a vision of. We’ve talked to IKEA, and they have 3D images of their furniture line. You’re talking about changing the whole experience of how you shop for, in this case, furniture and other objects that you can place around the home. You can take that idea and begin to think this is something that stretches from enterprise to consumer. There’s not a lot of things that do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hboXPl"&gt;You’ll see things happening in enterprises where AR is ­fundamental to what they’re doing. You’re going to see some consumer things that are unbelievably cool. Can we do everything we want to do now? No. The technology’s not complete yet. But that’s the beauty to a certain degree. This has a runway. And it’s an incredible runway. It’s time to put the seat belt on and go. When people begin to see what’s possible, it’s going to get them very excited—like we are, like we’ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DIea6k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; At an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323"&gt;event at Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Cook responds to a student who asks what technology he would consider “transformative.” Cook says there are widespread uses for AR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYUKHM"&gt;“I’m incredibly excited by AR because I can see uses for it everywhere. I can see uses for it in education, in consumers, in entertainment, in sports. I can see it in every business that I know anything about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JpVYm"&gt;“I also like the fact that it doesn’t isolate. I don’t like our products being used a lot. I like our products amplifying thoughts and I think AR can help amplify the human connection. I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite. There are clearly some cool niche things for VR but it’s not profound in my view. AR is profound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJlluP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; In an &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-future-of-fashion-augmented-reality"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Vogue UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says while Apple wasn’t looking to build a “giant database of clothes,” it would support companies in the AR space who were doing this work. “If you think about a runway show in the fashion world, that’s a great application of AR because some of these, you want to see the dress all the way around, you do not want to just see the front,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, noting how many runway shows are livestreamed and not just visible to an in-person audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBEvu6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;introduction of its ARKit platform on iOS 11&lt;/a&gt;, Cook says in a quarterly earnings call that &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;Apple has created&lt;/a&gt; the world’s largest augmented reality platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GdJYqz"&gt;There already are over a thousand apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of app aimed at consumers, students and business users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV7Y54"&gt;Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine from the human body to the solar system. And of course you experience them like you’re really there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je9Rb6"&gt;Instantly education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase – or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DM0tys"&gt;This is not quite what came to pass (more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJAyaa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-ARKit launch, Cook admits he &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-iphone-tim-cook-interview-features-new-augmented-reality-ar-arkit-a7993566.html"&gt;thinks AR technology&lt;/a&gt; for headsets or glasses isn’t yet up to par as far as Apple is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag0KHY"&gt;“I can tell you the technology itself doesn’t exist to do that in a quality way. The display technology required, as well as putting enough stuff around your face — there’s huge challenges with that. The field of view, the quality of the display itself, it’s not there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMoVt4"&gt;“We don’t give a rat’s about being first, we want to be the best, and give people a great experience. But now anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with. Nor do I think the vast majority of people would be satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvKmAY"&gt;“Most technology challenges can be solved, but it’s a matter of how long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiQf8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/02/01/apple-inc-appl-q1-2018-earnings-conference-call-tr.aspx"&gt;Apple’s Q1 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Cook describes “great excitement” around augmented reality among customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QNWq"&gt;“Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices, and with ARKit, we’re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yOGiC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2018: &lt;/strong&gt;Cook tells &lt;em&gt;NowThisNews&lt;/em&gt; during an interview about Apple’s Watch that AR is poised to become indispensable. “I think that one day we will wonder how we ever lived without it,” Cook says of AR. “We can have a much more enhanced conversation with the power of AR.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZOOfV"&gt;“The future is now,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZs5TM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX9xBB_vBsc?rel=0&amp;amp;start=433" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VO88JU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2020: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/tim-cook-ar-war-ducks-healthtech"&gt;Cook tells an audience in Dublin, Ireland&lt;/a&gt; that augmented reality “is the next big thing” and that it will “pervade our entire lives.” He gives an example of a company using AR and described its potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImgYq0"&gt;Yesterday, I visited a development company called War Ducks … in Dublin – 15 people and they’re staffing up and using AR for games. You can imagine, for games it’s incredible but even for our discussion here. You and I might be talking about an article and using AR we can pull it up, and can both be looking at the same thing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDw6RA"&gt;I think it’s something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lTJJO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; During an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;interview with journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; Cook agreed with her that augmented reality is “a critically important part of Apple’s future.” He imagines AR being used in health, education, retail, and gaming. “I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsfUXn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2021:&lt;/strong&gt; In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/UU6MtPwT_5c?t=547"&gt;an interview with tech YouTuber iJustine&lt;/a&gt;, Cook said that he was AR’s number one fan and reiterated his hopes for it as a collaboration tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nqOlVs"&gt;I am so excited about AR. I think AR is one of these very few profound technologies that we will look back on one day and went, how did we live our lives without it? And so right now you can experience it in thousands of ways using your iPad or your iPhone, but of course, those will get better and better over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfPD0k"&gt;Already it’s a great way to shop, it’s a great way to learn. It enhances the learning process. I can’t wait for it to be even more important in collaboration and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBwShJ"&gt;So I’m AR fan number one. I think it’s that big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoCvwM"&gt;After a comment from Justine about the future impact of AR, he continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JFbx8T"&gt;I mean, simple things today that you can use it for, like if you’re shopping for a sofa, or a chair, or a lamp, in terms of really experiencing it in your place, we’ve never been able to do that before until the last couple years or so. And that’s at the early innings of AR. It will only get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NExGsI"&gt;What’s Apple’s plan for AR?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZhJMH"&gt;Clearly, Tim Cook has been bullish on AR for a long time. But so far, Apple’s biggest foray into AR remains the 2017 launch of ARKit — which use iPhones’ and iPads’ cameras and sensors to overlay images in 3D space when the device is pointed at a given area — for iOS 11. ARKit is available across Apple’s devices, which meant a lot of &lt;a href="https://github.com/olucurious/Awesome-ARKit"&gt;cool little projects&lt;/a&gt; by amateur AR enthusiasts. When ARKit launched, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15742736/apple-arkit-augmented-reality-platform-wwdc-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the tech had the potential to allow Apple to catch rival Google in the AR space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv9YB6"&gt;But despite the interesting early projects, ARKit hype fizzled after a few months. It’s not totally clear why, because it was released at the height of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; craze when AR finally had a popular mass-market application for a devoted fan base. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;itself is still wildly profitable&lt;/a&gt;, raking in a billion dollars a year on average, but we haven’t seen a larger movement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikGTfK"&gt;Since ARKit, Apple has made other, smaller steps forward with AR apps for the iPhone. In May 2019, it introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/14/statue-of-liberty-ar-ios-app/"&gt;Statue of Liberty AR app&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1128412203932049408"&gt;Cook tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, “The Statue of Liberty app is just the beginning of how AR will transform the way we connect with our world’s treasures.” In July 2019, it introduced augmented reality art sessions for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh9exC"&gt;In addition to Tim Cook’s constant cheerleading of the technology, there are other signs that Apple is moving toward an AR future. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natbro/status/1155849145350909954"&gt;hiring of people like Nat Brown&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Microsoft; listing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/01/apple-lists-ar-vr-jobs-reportedly-taps-executive-who-finalizes-products/"&gt;dozens of AR and VR job postings&lt;/a&gt;; acquisitions including &lt;a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/28/apple-buys-german-augmented-reality-firm-metaio/"&gt;Metaio in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15877520/apple-sensomotoric-instruments-acquisition-ar-vr-eye-tracking"&gt;SensoMotoric in 2017&lt;/a&gt;; and patents on things like “&lt;a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=09383582&amp;amp;SectionNum=1&amp;amp;IDKey=4E2221DF6AD9&amp;amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=9,383,582.PN.%2526OS=PN/9,383,582%2526RS=PN/9,383,582"&gt;head mounted display&lt;/a&gt;” devices all demonstrate its steady progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WuEKr7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s AR hardware is perennially two years away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbknTJ"&gt;Reports started &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-augmented-reality-vr-virtual-reality-headset-powered-by-a-wireless-wigig-hub/"&gt;trickling out in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that Apple had a timeline to launch both an AR headset and AR glasses. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses"&gt;The company had 1,000 engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on its VR and AR initiative — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/apple-augmented-reality-headset-executive-leaves-company"&gt;codenamed “T288”&lt;/a&gt; — which were expected to include a combined VR and AR headset to be released in 2021 or 2022, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;, with a pair of sleeker AR glasses predicted to launch in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqsIdJ"&gt;The latest reporting from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;however, indicates that an Apple AR / VR headset may need to rely on the processor of another connected device like an iPhone (similar to the early Apple Watch models), and that Apple is working on a custom chip for the helmet-like headset that might take at least another year to arrive. Some aren’t as bullish on the glasses-like variant either; &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; suggests Apple could still release that in 2023, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks&lt;/a&gt; a 2025 release is more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2d0mj"&gt;It shouldn’t be all that surprising that Apple has taken its time making AR hardware. It is, after all, the company that introduced the AirPower wireless charging pad, showed it off to the world, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;canceled the product because it wasn’t up to company standards&lt;/a&gt; — and that was just an charging accessory, not a potentially new computing paradigm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrJyTD"&gt;So it’s to be expected that Apple would take its time on an AR or VR headset. After hyping the potential for AR all this time, Cook surely doesn’t want Apple to repeat the failure of Google Glass by launching iGlasses too soon, and definitely not before the technology meets Apple’s very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surprise! Deltarune Chapter 2 drops September 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-P6C4EhB00ko2MeTZaIuUyEapY=/87x0:951x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867523/sc6709.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;toby fox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2runu"&gt;The next chapter of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047410/undertale-spinoff-sequel-deltarune-toby-fox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is coming and I am beyond excited. In a surprise announcement, Toby Fox, creator of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series, revealed &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; will be released on Mac and PC on September 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCr3Ct"&gt;The news came on September 15th during a livestream of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune Chapter 1&lt;/em&gt; put on to commemorate &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;’s sixth anniversary. Hosted by three dads from Fangamer — a gaming merchandise retailer — the &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; livestream featured hideous dad-approved shirts, canned laughter typical of a ‘90s sitcom, and commentary from Toby Fox himself via a skateboarding &lt;a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Annoying_Dog"&gt;Annoying Dog&lt;/a&gt; proxy with a text-to-speech voice. You can (and should) check out a VOD of the wholesome stream here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3MBrBD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rksOYId-cNA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JWQsF9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; is the much anticipated follow-up to Toby Fox’s award-winning indie RPG &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;. The game follows the human Kris as they live and attend school in a town populated entirely by monsters. One day, Kris and the school bully Susie fall into an alternate reality known as the Dark World and are tasked with restoring the light and bringing balance to the land. Along the way, they meet Ralsei and Lancer, two “darkners” who help (and sometimes hinder) Susie and Kris’ quest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMwfE6"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt;’s release was broken up into installments, the first of which came out in October 2018. Two years later, &lt;a href="https://deltarune.com/update-092020/"&gt;Fox wrote an update&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt;’s progress, sharing how game design considerations and health problems had slowed development but that he was confident the next chapter of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; would come soon. Now, a year after that announcement that coincided with &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;’s fifth anniversary, the next chapter of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iB0iZl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See you soon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z19tzGlRmW"&gt;https://t.co/Z19tzGlRmW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hKU0st0LCb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hKU0st0LCb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE (@UnderTale) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTale/status/1438330666869878787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GS4REG"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://deltarune.com/help/"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, console ports of &lt;em&gt;Deltarune&lt;/em&gt; are not on the table at the moment, and it is unknown if this chapter will be available for free like &lt;em&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/em&gt; was. &lt;em&gt;Deltarune Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; hits Mac and PC September 17th and you can catch up with &lt;em&gt;Deltarune Chapter 1&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deltarune.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Office 2021 will launch on October 5th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_APh_b8Awt2RtrxTbnK45iAX7M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69867302/office_icons_HD_00005.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DjrHqj"&gt;Microsoft is launching its next perpetual version of Microsoft Office for commercial customers today, and promising an Office 2021 consumer release on October 5th. Microsoft Office Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) for Windows and Mac will be available for commercial and government users today, providing a locked-in time release of Office that doesn’t require a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrqoXF"&gt;Office LTSC is designed for businesses in regulated industries where processes and apps can’t change on a monthly basis, or for manufacturing plants that rely on Office and want a locked-in time release. It won’t ship with the AI- and cloud-powered features that are found in Microsoft 365, and it won’t receive new features, either. Microsoft will support Office LTSC for five years, and the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288959/microsoft-office-2021-windows-mac-features-release-date-price"&gt;also committed to another perpetual version of Office&lt;/a&gt; for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SavjRQ"&gt;The consumer Office 2021 perpetual release will be very similar, offering a locked-in time release without feature updates. Microsoft lists the following additions to Office LTSC, that should also apply to Office 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AecNkI"&gt;Line Focus - similar to a reading mode to remove distraction and move through Word documents line by line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GSYKkZ"&gt;XLOOKUP function - helps find things in a table or range by row in an Excel worksheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N2Xh88"&gt;Dynamic array support - new functions in Excel that use dynamic arrays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sY1OWs"&gt;Dark mode - all Office apps will include dark mode support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiuHh63G8T-dKETHBFhCc8EiKm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291771/darkmodenewquick.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark mode in Office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z5n2S1"&gt;Microsoft still, naturally, recommends Microsoft 365 for both businesses and consumers, where the company has more than 300 million paid seats for Office 365 on the commercial side. Microsoft did recently announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632888/microsoft-office-365-price-increase-march-2022"&gt;first price increase&lt;/a&gt; for both Microsoft 365 and Office 365 that goes into effect in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MpfpN"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t yet detailed pricing for Office 2021, but the company says it will be generally available on October 5th, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;same day Windows 11 launches&lt;/a&gt;. More details on Office 2021 features and pricing will follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer says its new mechanical keyboards have ‘near-zero’ input latency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qh5js-SQjCc8OU_S7FH79y9xF9U=/0x0:3231x2154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866895/sc07sh01___Main_Key_Visual.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huntsman V2 includes a volume wheel and media keys.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="35qYtR"&gt;Razer has announced an update to its popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/28/17513342/razer-huntsman-elite-keyboard-ir-opto-mechanical-switches-chroma-led-lights"&gt;Huntsman lineup of mechanical keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that reduces input latency to “near-zero,” the company claims. That’s because the newly announced Huntsman V2 and Huntsman V2 Tenkeyless (which omits the numpad, volume wheel, and media controls for a more compact board) both have a polling rate of 8,000Hz, meaning they can theoretically detect key presses eight times faster than the original Huntsman keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azt3YF"&gt;Combined with the keyboards’ optical switches, which use an infrared beam of light to sense when they’ve been pressed rather than metal contact points, Razer reckons the two new Huntsman keyboards will feel more responsive for gaming, especially when combined with a high-refresh rate monitor. In contrast, standard mechanical switches can suffer from what’s known as a “debounce delay,” when the keyboard has to take a moment to work out if a key has actually been pressed or not. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sMOGaUFN86RuflRbB2bhlO_Vn_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854691/sc07sh03_kv_v006.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tenkeyless model is more compact and features a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a8nNrf"&gt;Other improvements introduced with the V2 keyboards include new doubleshot PBT keycaps, which have a more durable design with legends that shouldn’t wear away over time. The doubleshot design also allows the keyboard’s programmable RGB backlighting to shine through the caps. There are seven preset lighting effects built into the keyboard, and you can customize them via Razer’s software and save them to the board’s firmware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YccwcO"&gt;Both keyboards are available with either Razer’s clicky or linear optical switches. The linear switches have also seen improvements since the keyboard’s first iteration, with the addition of a silicon sound dampener inside, and more lubricant to make them feel smoother to press. Razer also says it’s improved the acoustics of the keyboards, with the addition of a new layer of sound dampening foam, and there’s now a wrist rest included in the box with both keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHFwXY"&gt;The full-size Huntsman V2 features a volume wheel and media controls on its top right, but only the smaller tenkeyless model has a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P92tDg"&gt;The announcement of the new keyboards follows the launch of the first entry to the Huntsman V2 lineup earlier this year. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264192/razer-huntsman-v2-analog-keyboard-release-date-price-features"&gt;Huntsman V2 Analog&lt;/a&gt;, as its name suggests, is a keyboard with analog switches, allowing you to program two functions to a single key press or adjust exactly how much you need to push a key down for it to register a press (known as the “actuation point”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfouh7"&gt;Both of Razer’s new keyboards are going on sale today. The full-size Huntsman V2 will cost $189.99 with clicky switches and $199.99 with linear switches, while the more compact Tenkeyless model costs $149.99 with clicky or $159.99 with linear switches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gF1xCb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nh4Dcz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra Elite 3 review: nailing the essentials for $80</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;They’re consistent, they’re reliable, and they sound quite good for the price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RKkoGF"&gt;After establishing a strong reputation with great, dependable earbuds like the Elite 75t, Jabra is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"&gt;overhauling its whole lineup&lt;/a&gt; with three new models. At the high end are the $199 Elite 7 Pros and $179 Elite 7 Active earbuds, which will hit shelves in October. But for many, the most exciting part of Jabra’s latest trio will be the Elite 3 earbuds, which are the company’s first true wireless earbuds to launch at a price under $100. They only cost $79.99, putting them in competition with EarFun, Anker, JLab, and other companies that are known for quality buds on a budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjcMhN"&gt;Jabra doesn’t shoot for the Moon with the Elite 3s; they lack active noise cancellation and they sacrifice one feature that’s become a hallmark of Jabra earbuds: multipoint support. You can only pair these with one device at a time, whereas the company’s other products can connect to two audio sources simultaneously. It stings, but it’s also a predictable omission at this asking price. What you’re left with is a set of earbuds that outshine sound quality expectations, deliver lengthy battery life, and above all else, come through with consistent, reliable performance — which can’t always be said of other sub-$100 earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jsbIXU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10756229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VKd9bG"&gt;From a design standpoint, the Elite 3s have evolved beyond the utilitarian look of the 65t / 75t / 85t and show a little more style. Jabra describes it as “a sleek Danish design.” My review unit is the standard dark gray, but there are lilac purple and beige options if you want something brighter. Instead of the usual circular button on the exterior, these earbuds have more of a teardrop shape, and the mini stem with perforated mic holes from the company’s past buds is also gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40UGzV"&gt;But the Elite 3s feel very familiar once seated in your ears; thankfully, they use round ear tips instead of the oval-shaped tips that came with the 85t buds, which never fit as snugly as I would’ve liked. (Three sizes of silicone tips come in the box.) If you liked how the 75t buds fit, you’ll be right at home with these, and their lighter weight makes for even better comfort over longer periods. I never felt any soreness when wearing the Elite 3s. A good seal is crucial for the best passive noise isolation, and I was pleased with how these buds managed to subdue outside noise — even without ANC. They might lack multipoint, but on the plus side, you can use either earbud independently in mono mode. That hasn’t been the case for Jabra’s previous earbuds, so it’s a welcome improvement for the 2021 lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4qHSlvEv81OHeqFnfgzfzK0Q5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854830/DSCF5590_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These earbuds don’t protrude from the ear as far as Jabra’s others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gAnFzm"&gt;The charging case looks very similar to Jabra’s others and remains nicely compact. But the company definitely opted for a lighter, cheaper plastic this time; the lid has some creaking and a bit of flex, and the case itself picks up scuffs quite easily. Functionally, it does the job fine and holds the earbuds securely. And the battery status LED is sensibly positioned on the front, unlike older Jabra earbud cases where it was around back. There’s no wireless charging here — just USB-C for wired recharges. For battery life, Jabra says the Elite 3s can hit up to seven hours of continuous playing time, and my experience so far gives me little reason to doubt that estimate. The case holds enough juice for three recharges, so you get 28 hours of listening time in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Q0jm3hPx-XRfpIZpmLuIuLVwzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22855009/DSCF5583_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case feels rather cheap and scuffs easily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hx7nHY"&gt;The Elite 3s don’t sound like $80 earbuds, and I mean that in the best possible way. Unlike the fatiguing, inarticulate sound signature that is all too common at this price, Jabra’s new budget buds have a nicely balanced EQ that lends the bass some added punch, but not to objectionable levels. The sound isn’t as full-bodied as with the Elite 75t or 85t buds, but it’s far from muddy. Listening to Kacey Musgraves’ new album &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, the Elite 3s did a great job with both elaborate, reverb-heavy tracks like “Cherry Blossom” and the vulnerable, acoustic “Hookup Scene.” Dua Lipa’s “Levitating” goes to show that the bass isn’t quite as thumping as on Jabra’s other earbuds, however. Supported Bluetooth codecs include standard AptX and SBC, but not Apple’s preferred AAC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQv8R5fwdzNT7_7wZvbXCynPD0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854839/DSCF5589_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elite 3s lack manual EQ controls, unlike Jabra’s other earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BHEAO8"&gt;The Jabra Sound Plus app, available on both Android and iOS, offers a few different EQ presets like bass and treble boost, though you lose the full slider controls that are reserved for the company’s pricier earbuds. That feels a little stingy to me, but I’ll take some EQ flexibility over none at all. You’re also stuck with the default controls, though there’s not much I’d want to change about them. The right earbud handles audio controls, while the left summons your preferred voice assistant. (Jabra supports Amazon Alexa in addition to Siri or Google Assistant.) I really like that the buttons now take up the full outer surface of the earbuds, making them effortless to find and press. And they’ve got a nice click. No one likes mushy buttons no matter the price. On Android, Jabra supports Fast Pair for quicker setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZ7EkqlsfRyZ3wNZas6R_l14yJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22854832/DSCF5581_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jabra has redesigned its latest earbuds with a bit more style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPOmVz"&gt;The Elite 3s feature a HearThrough transparency mode to give you some awareness of your surroundings. But it’s muffled enough that I rarely bothered toggling it on. The situation where it’s most helpful is when you activate sidetone (which lets you better hear your own voice) on calls. Speaking of which, these earbuds perform decently but aren’t going to boggle the mind. I never got any complaints about mic quality on the phone or over Zoom, and everyone could clearly make out what I was saying, though they do have that talking-on-earbuds sound to them. For $80, that still checks off the “good enough” box for me. Jabra rates the durability of the Elite 3s as IP55, meaning they’re resistant to everyday dust and can handle sweat and splashes of water, but shouldn’t be submerged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="e5OFrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10756258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHo8WT"&gt;Despite their appealing cost and solid performance, I’ve still got some minor nitpicks: the Elite 3s use tones and beeps to indicate pairing status and other functions instead of the unmistakable voice feedback from Jabra’s prior earbuds. I really hope this doesn’t carry over to the more premium new models. There’s no auto-pause on the Elite 3s when you remove an earbud. And as we continue to see active noise cancellation trickle down into more affordable buds from companies like EarFun, Anker, and TCL, Jabra might have to get more ambitious next time around. Or at least improve the rinky-dink case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HS7AnS"&gt;But as the company’s first earbuds coming in under the $100 mark, the Jabra Elite 3s managed to impress me with their well-considered mix of sound quality, steadfast performance, easy controls, decent call quality, and lengthy battery life. There are other features you might &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; for one reason or another, but I can’t think of much else I’d really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wipeout gets ‘reimagined’ as a mobile game where you manage instead of drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wipeout Rush" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAYiRItfE5je3fDHFY-ogAwGD4w=/0x0:1942x1295/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866650/wipeoutrush.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="or3y46"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, the fast-paced, futuristic racing series that’s synonymous with PlayStation, is coming to iOS and Android mobile devices later in 2021. The new game is called &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, and unfortunately, it might not be what you’re after if you’ve adored previous entries in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI50dq"&gt;The game, developed by Rogue, is a card-based racing game that doesn’t actually put you in the driver's seat. Instead, you’ll be the team manager of racers who will get to do all of the fun driving while you’re dealing with cards. The game promises to dive into the lore of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m most looking forward to finding out why the player can’t drive. Did they lose their license?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pymiAg"&gt;Here’s a description of &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://rogueco.com/portfolio-item/wipeout-rush/"&gt;as noted on Rogue’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4Q0mTJ"&gt;For fans of the series, &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; is bringing loads of new lore through collectables and story. Players will be able to unlock collectable cards to learn more about the ships, teams, pilots, and tracks of the Wipeout world as they progress through an engaging single-player campaign told through exciting animated comics. &lt;em&gt;Wipeout Rush&lt;/em&gt; will include both Quick Race and Championship Cup game modes complete with 5 different tracks, 60 iconic Wipeout ships, a wide range of familiar weapons, 12 Championship Cups each with their own boss, and bundles of collectables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BX0rfV"&gt;For a second there, I imagined how great a &lt;em&gt;Wipeout &lt;/em&gt;game for phones could look and play, especially now that there are several phones with fast refresh rate displays (the iPhone 13 Pro is the most notable addition to that group recently), as well as solid mobile controllers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RonRWE"&gt;I’m willing to give this game a shot when it comes out, and it could be fun in its own way, but it’s been a while since I’ve so quickly gone from being excited about something to just being a little sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHi11c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXLIvJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is $800 off at Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBksi0"&gt;Gaming laptops are by no means cheap, but today you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086M8PQYR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $800 on the Razer Blade 15 Advanced at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This laptop was built expressly for the purpose of delivering desktop gaming performance in a laptop form factor. Packing an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q graphics card and a 10875H Intel processor capable of topping out at 5.0GHz, the Razer Blade 15 does exactly that. The FHD display has a 300Hz refresh rate, better than you’d see on most desktop gaming monitors, allowing for sharp reaction times and virtually no lag, letting you get the drop on your enemy. A 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM round out the laptop’s specs, offering you plenty of onboard storage and speed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Razer Blade 15 Advanced review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="y47mjC"&gt;Ahead of the new 2021 base iPad releasing next Friday, September 24th, you can save $30 on a preorder through Walmart. Normally $329 for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;the 64GB Wi-Fi model that Apple just introduced&lt;/a&gt; at its “California Streaming” event, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1133983/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $299&lt;/a&gt;. So, get it for this price while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwoqO3"&gt;This model features a slate of improvements over the previous generation, including the bump up to 64GB of storage, the faster A13 Bionic processor, and True Tone screen tech that lets the screen match the color temperature in your room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ObZyjs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbGCeh"&gt;If you’re a streamer in the market for a new microphone, look no further than the Razer Seiren Emote, now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XB39R7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This slick hyper-cardioid condenser microphone bears a striking resemblance to the other entries in the Seiren family, until it connects with Razer’s streamer companion app. The front of the mic contains an 8-bit LED display, capable of showing hundreds of customizable emotes that react to your chat. While this mic certainly isn’t for everyone, you’ll have a hard time finding a microphone more unique or better suited to connecting with your audience during a stream. Amazon notes that only a few units are left in stock, so hopefully it replenishes throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w0ml3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gj9UpW"&gt;Anyone looking for a midsize 4K TV should definitely check out this deal at Best Buy. This 50-inch model from Sony is still &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAEDde5Aev#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy for $700&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date. In addition to offering crisp 4K resolution, the X80J touts several features that elevate the viewing experience. HDR10 and Dolby Vision certification provide deeper blacks and more vivid colors, while built-in voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant allow you to easily search and swap channels. The TV includes built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, too, which help cut down on cord clutter, and the X80J can be wall-mounted with any 200 x 200 VESA mount. The TV can also handle up to four HDMI devices and offers an audio return channel in case you want to route your devices through a soundbar or receiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nHPwZ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gReWX9"&gt;One of the lightest wireless mice in Razer’s arsenal is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Hyperspeed-Lightest-Wireless/dp/B07YPC3BQC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for just $120 today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its normal retail price of $150. The Viper has been a mainstay of the Razer armory for some time, but this wireless version brings some solid improvements to the tested design. The Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed weighs a paltry 74 grams and packs a powerful 20K DPI optical sensor. The ambidextrous design also sports six remappable buttons, making it one of the best mice available for southpaw shooters. The most noticeable improvement, however, is the inclusion of wireless connectivity. It can be paired either via Bluetooth or to the included 2.4GHz dongle, and the Viper Ultimate is said to last up to 70 hours on a single charge and can be recharged either via Micro USB or with the included recharging dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udUahX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10754700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V7YzIa"&gt;A pair of earbuds that no Apple aficionado should be without, the Beats Powerbeats Pro, are &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1151608/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpowerbeats-pro-wireless-earphones%2F-%2FA-78362035" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Target for $175 in red&lt;/a&gt;. These water-resistant earbuds can handle even the sweatiest workouts, and the adjustable ear hooks ensure they won’t jostle loose during a run. The earbuds can last for up to nine hours on a single charge but can stretch to 24 hours if the case is topped off. While the earbuds definitely work best with Apple devices thanks to their built-in H1 chip — a piece of hardware allows for always-on Siri detection and better call quality in windy environments, among other improvements — they can be used with a wide variety of Bluetooth-enabled devices. Just note that the charging case can only connect using an Apple lightning cable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WGWd5F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EzqOl"&gt;A solid addition to any Xbox or PC gaming setup, the HyperX CloudX Flight Wireless is currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAVP3dG6gn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fkingston-hyperx-cloudx-flight-wireless-gaming-headset%2F93G680VL1NKH%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; for $120, its second-best price to date. HyperX is known for its comfortable and functional gaming headsets. It may lack some of the outward flair of its competitors, but the CloudX can still trade blows with competing headsets that are nearly double the price. The CloudX Flight comes with a detachable boom mic, leatherette ear cups, and boasts a battery life of up to 30 hours. While the CloudX has been designed for the Xbox family of consoles, it can still connect to PCs thanks to its 2.4GHz wireless dongle. It even comes with a built-in chat mixer, so you can adjust your audio levels without combing through in-game menus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the YouTubers determined to find lost media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sCwC-RHX-F1GCne1KUh-_Mv9zQ=/119x0:1382x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866569/a2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bobdunga&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AM5RO"&gt;When I was 11, I remember seeing a weird commercial on television. During the commercial break of a Slamball rerun (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ib-AJA7v9Kk"&gt;remember Slamball?&lt;/a&gt;) on Cartoon Network, I saw an AIDS awareness ad. It was made specifically for kids, and it was accompanied by an annoying rap. I distinctly remember the chorus: “What do you know about AIDS?!” It’s been stuck in my head for years. I guess you’re expecting me to link the commercial I’m describing, right? Well, I can’t, because I’ve never found it. I’ve never even seen it mentioned online. This commercial is what’s known as “lost media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nM1W5Y"&gt;Online, there’s a lost media community dedicated to preserving everything from unaired television pilots to unreleased video game prototypes. Currently, the lost media community exists on both YouTube and &lt;a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Home"&gt;the Lost Media wiki&lt;/a&gt;, an archive of thousands of lost media topics. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LSuperSonicQ"&gt;LSuperSonicQ&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known member of the lost media community and has many videos covering lost media topics such as the &lt;em&gt;Johnny Bravo&lt;/em&gt; pilot and unreleased My Chemical Romance songs. His fascination with lost media started on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fs6Hiq"&gt;“I knew nothing about lost media at all until I watched a video from this other kind of lost media YouTuber,” said LSuperSonicQ. “His name is blameitonjorge. And this is like, back in 2015… It was like, top 40 lost or banned episodes of kids TV shows.” LSuperSonicQ watched the video, and from that point on, he said, he was “hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ij0fR"&gt;Lost media searches can take a long time, depending on what is being sought after and whether there are any complications, such as nondisclosure agreements, people leaving jobs, or creators just not remembering past projects. LSuperSonicQ took months to find the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2s0nFAw8GeU"&gt;lost pilot for the TV show &lt;em&gt;Kappa Mikey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which aired on Nicktoons Network in the mid-2000s. This lost pilot was made in order to pitch the show to MTV. LSuperSonicQ was able to contact the creator of the show and convince him to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8KoVLI3XuGM"&gt;upload that original pilot to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. He now considers this his favorite piece of lost media. Plus, the search was a good learning experience for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNSk3y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KoVLI3XuGM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDuUMd"&gt;“That was a really, really big deal, when that happened,” said LSuperSonicQ. “It was my longest-lasting media search at the time, and I learned a lot of techniques in that search that I have applied to future searches and how I go about contacting people and trying to find stuff. So it was a really, really big turning point in my own personal lost media journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3hu7xP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NIqqmw"&gt;Not all searches end in success, but they can still be entertaining, since lost media is all about the search and why the media became lost in the first place. YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GWq_TBvJKWLFIb2eLp-bw"&gt;Bobdunga&lt;/a&gt; recently dove into the world of lost media in her hunt for the &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;video game, chronicling her search in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D8ZUR2De15s"&gt;two-part Youtube documentary&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;game was always seen as a mystery by the lost media community, but most didn’t seem too interested in solving it. “I feel that a lot of that had to do with the fact that the game was inherently deemed as shovelware right off the bat,” said Bobdunga. The 2000s featured many licensed games that were created just to cash in on the popularity of an upcoming film release. “This was especially common for ‘girl games,’” said Bobdunga. “I think a lot of people behind the scenes didn’t have that good of a grasp at what girls liked in gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRERfr"&gt;For her, &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls &lt;/em&gt;was more than just another “girl game.” “What really drew me to wanting to dive into &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; was mainly because it was such a hot-button lost media topic that was surrounded by so much confusion and misinformation,” she said. “I think it was my want to dissect all of it, even if I didn’t come out finding the actual game, that really drew me into the project.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT0ECm"&gt;She told me this was her first time creating YouTube content about lost media, but not her first experience with it. “I’ve always been very partial to both true crime and lost media videos,” she said. “They seem to fit together really well, because they both share an ominous, almost storytelling-like atmosphere. And a lot of the time, the narrator will have a really calm or even creepy voice to further immerse the viewer. There’s something inherently spooky about lost media, especially in a digital age where we feel we can find everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFC0Qy"&gt;After months of searching, she eventually found it. An anonymous source sent her the game’s ROM file after viewing the first part of her documentary. Since then, she has recently &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3AQh9Nx6_Gw"&gt;uploaded footage of the game&lt;/a&gt; to her YouTube channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywokja"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8ZUR2De15s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3SLvt0"&gt;Enthusiasts see lost media as a way to preserve history, even if it’s something as obscure as a canceled video game or lost TV pilot. “Not everything has such a strong digital footprint, and it’s important to preserve all types of media, whether it be physical or digital,” said Bobdunga. “It isn’t only a nostalgic memory for some but the media in question could also act as a small glimpse into what the world was like when it was produced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuy427"&gt;LSuperSonicQ took a similar stance. “It has to do with pop culture. It has to do with, you know, what people were interested in at the time it was made. And there’s lost media that goes all the way back to the 1920s. They’re silent films that are lost for people to look for. And it goes all the way up to the 2010s and 2020s. By being able to preserve and archive and document that kind of thing, I really think, in a way, it really helps the historical aspect of our culture and where we came from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CyiBe"&gt;Without the work of the lost media community, these parts of our culture and history would be lost to time. In the digital age, it has become harder for media to get lost, since almost everything is online, but it is still a possibility. If companies don’t do their part by making their older media easily available, then it’s up to the fans to do their part and preserve history.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new ninth-gen iPad is $30 off before it’s even out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UmwDCYocH1nUKb0fnM_2ejgvhzo=/170x0:2006x1224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866492/apple_event_2021_427.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XM74UA"&gt;Apple just announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at the iPhone 13 event and began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;taking orders&lt;/a&gt;, with availability opening up on September 24th. But now, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a nice discount on preorders of its own&lt;/a&gt;. You can preorder the new base model 2021 iPad with a $30 discount, bringing the price down to just $299 for the 64GB Wi-Fi configuration. It will ship a little bit later than if purchased through Apple, around September 29th, but it’s rare get a 10 percent discount on a brand-new product if you’re willing to wait just a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J4xFRv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I4Nhvs"&gt;The new iPad is the latest version of Apple’s most popular model of tablet. It features a 10.2-inch non-laminated Retina display, Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the physical home button, first-generation Apple Pencil compatibility, and a smart connector for a keyboard attachment. If that all sounds familiar, it should, because those are holdovers from last year’s iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92b3sY"&gt;This new model also has a claimed 20 percent performance bump thanks to its A13 Bionic processor, double the base storage at 64GB, a 20W USB-C charger with USB-C to Lightning cable included, True Tone display, and the new Center Stage feature for keeping you framed up during video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq1RDA"&gt;The entry-level iPads have long been the default tablet for many, and it’s nice to see some quality of life improvements when many folks out there might find a device like this essential for child use or content-consumption — even nicer when you can be an early adopter and still save some coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gxuQkE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ShlYno"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro announces Hero 10 Black with 5.3K60 and smartphone-like features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxGdhOQ9nQCHMwhdxfcLqZS1YEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69866244/bfarsace_210909_4746_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HtLuLw"&gt;GoPro has announced the next version of its action camera, which has a new processor that lets the camera shoot in higher frame rates (for that cool slow-motion footage), have better stabilization, and automatically upload videos to the cloud while charging. The new processor also works to make using the GoPro Hero 10 Black a faster, more responsive experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXH0lD"&gt;In a lot of cases, the Hero 10 can shoot at double the frame rate of the Hero 9: it can now shoot at 5.3K at 60 frames per second (offering both the frame rate improvement as well as a small resolution bump) and can shoot at 4K120, and 2.7K240. While 240fps is still as slow (er, fast?) as the camera will get, it’s now able to shoot that frame rate at 2.7K, versus the 1080 resolution limit of the GoPro Hero 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3PvkVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of GoPro’s biggest competition is phone cameras, and it’s more like a phone than ever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qI2gAq"&gt;GoPro says this increase in performance is due to the camera’s new GP2 processor, which is a successor to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fwhat-is-the-gp1-chip-in-hero6-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the GP1 chip it’s used in cameras ever since the Hero 6 Black&lt;/a&gt;. The company continuing to have custom chips for its cameras is a tactic that makes sense, as some of GoPro’s toughest competition comes from the smartphone market, where companies like Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;and Google&lt;/a&gt; are taking the same approach. The GP2 also allows the Hero 10 to be phone-like in a few ways, from its very responsive touchscreen to the heavy video processing that it's doing with things like local tone mapping and improved noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u74tCr"&gt;Arguably, though, one of the most smartphone-esque features is the camera's ability to upload videos to the cloud while it’s charging. However, doing so will require &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fsubscribe-to-gopro-subscription%2FGoProPlusYearly.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F16%2F22675730%2Fgopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a GoPro subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 a month or $50 a year. The subscription also gets you $100 off the camera, bringing its price of $499 down to $399, and it also includes access to GoPro’s &lt;a href="https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/GoPro-Subscription-Camera-Replacement-FAQ/ta-p/394296"&gt;damaged camera replacement program&lt;/a&gt;. The launch price, though, represents the slow creep up of the cost of GoPro’s cameras — without a subscription, the Hero 9 cost $450 at launch, which was itself up from $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892060/gopro-hero-8-black-mounitng-system-software-specs-price-ship"&gt;with the Hero 8&lt;/a&gt;. This year, of course, there’s also the possible factor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the ever-present chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ihdly_jTD5S3x-1x5hazefgXzEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853035/UuWJ4Owe.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GoPro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro continues to push its subscription by offering discounts and adding new features that rely on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="buOYUB"&gt;For those who don’t want a subscription, it’s also easier to get footage off the camera with your smartphone. GoPro says the new chip makes wireless transfers to its app 30 percent faster, and there’s also a new option to transfer your footage with an honest-to-goodness cable for those really looking for reliable, fast offloading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikY9y85R8pkH_IzQX2fuEkas-HQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853257/GPOP.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoPro’s maximum horizon leveling mixed with HyperSmooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOYQaD"&gt;The new camera also comes with a few smaller improvements that make it more appealing. The camera’s “horizon leveling” feature, where it tries to keep the horizon as a straight line, lets the camera tilt up to 45 degrees before the sky starts moving, compared to the 27 degrees from the Hero 9. Unfortunately, the improved horizon leveling isn’t available on the camera’s highest resolutions and frame rates, as it’s limited to 4K at 60 frames per second and 2.7K or 1080 at 120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiem0Y"&gt;The still photos the camera takes are also getting a resolution bump, from 20MP to 23MP, with still frames pulled from video reaching 19.6MP when shooting in the camera’s 5K 4:3 mode and 15.8MP when shooting in the 5.3K60 mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mooYPB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Hero 10 has some quality-of-life improvements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yo91xI"&gt;GoPro also says that a new generation of its HyperSmooth stabilization feature can be used while you’re streaming live — though getting the highest video quality from your streams will also require a GoPro subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWNh8U"&gt;If you had a Hero 9 and bought some of GoPro’s Mod add-ons, the company says most of them should be compatible — including the Max Lens Mod, though support for it will be coming in a future software update. Even the stock lens gets a bit of improvement, though, with GoPro saying that it should repeal water easier and be harder to scratch. (And, of course, it’s still removable.)&lt;/p&gt;
