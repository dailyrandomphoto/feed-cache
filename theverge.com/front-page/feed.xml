    <title>Big Tech edges closer to break up after deeply unhinged markup</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mvhFbP"&gt;After nearly two years of investigations, the House Judiciary Committee met Wednesday to push forward on a package of bills targeting the power large tech companies like Amazon and Facebook hold over the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SQwBu"&gt;“With this package of historic legislation, we have the opportunity to take control of our own destiny to be a global leader in developing rules of the road for the digital economy,” Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said at the top of the hearing. “We cannot be complacent and we cannot delay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4nOEo5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We cannot be complacent and we cannot delay”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbth64"&gt;But while all six bills were eventually approved out of committee... delay, delay, the lawmakers did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fI4GoA"&gt;The markup kicked off Wednesday morning and lasted through Thursday afternoon with a few short breaks in between. The package was introduced earlier this month with broad bipartisan support. But this week’s markup shows that there are still fractures in both the Republican and Democratic caucuses, signaling that the measures aren’t out of hot water yet and could still fail when they come up for an (undetermined) final vote on the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tiKCqe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKAY, BUT WHAT DO THE BILLS SAY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XJaARL"&gt;Lawmakers started off with some of the less controversial measures. At the top, they approved a bill that would update filing fees for mergers for the first time in nearly two decades. The bill, called the&lt;strong&gt; Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act&lt;/strong&gt;, would give the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission more money to take on antitrust cases against tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t84Dh7"&gt;Another bill, called the &lt;strong&gt;State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act&lt;/strong&gt;, was also approved favorably and heads to the House floor for a final vote. If it passes, the bill would make sure state attorneys general who file federal antitrust cases against a company like Facebook would be able to have that case heard in the court they select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhCIOt"&gt;Things got a lot testier once the committee reached the third bill, the&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACCESS Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— especially among Democrats representing California, the home of Silicon Valley. The bill outlines new standards for data portability and interoperability. Democrats like Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Republicans like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) argued that the bill could make it easier for American companies to transfer user data to Chinese ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7kVtd"&gt;The bill was later approved, but Democrats, like Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), promised that their decision to push the bill through committee didn’t mean that they will vote for it later on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSSDcR"&gt;Early Thursday morning, lawmakers moved on to the &lt;strong&gt;Platform Competition and Opportunity Act&lt;/strong&gt;. The measure would bar large tech platforms from buying up nascent competitors — think &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/"&gt;Facebook buying Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. After hours of debate, it was approved, but with three California Democrats voting against the measure. Before ending at 5AM Thursday, lawmakers also approved the &lt;strong&gt;American Choice and Innovation Act&lt;/strong&gt;, a nondiscrimination measure&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that bars companies like Google from giving preference to their own products on their own services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARuElC"&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;Ending Platform Monopolies Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;made its way out of the committee. It would force large companies like Amazon to sell off different lines of business that conflict with one another. The bill eliminates the ability of large platforms to use the control they have in different lines of business to hurt competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSH9bK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Vh0XpL"&gt;Well, they’re headed to the House floor! There will be over 400 lawmakers voting on these bills instead of the couple dozen who marked them up over the last couple hours. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) seems eager to approve these measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRlpOt"&gt;At a press conference Thursday, Pelosi told reporters, “There has been concern on both sides of the aisle about the consolidation of power of the tech companies and this legislation is an attempt to address that.” She continued, “We are not going to ignore the consolidation that has happened and the concern that exists on both sides of the aisle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsfjBk"&gt;Of the six bills, the merger filing fee measure is the only one headed into conference where House and Senate lawmakers will tinker with the language before it lands on President Biden’s desk. The other five will also need to be introduced in the Senate, move through the committee process, and reach at least 60 votes on the floor, so long as the filibuster stays in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ogooq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-says-working-companion-bills-house-antitrust-measures-2021-06-15/"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she would be introducing similar measures to those last five bills in the Senate. As of publication, it’s unclear when those bills would be introduced and what the committee process would look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avDra4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu3S9J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer Blade 14 review: pint-size power</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Razer puts the Blade 15’s power in a smaller package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L4THpQ"&gt;From the outside, the Razer Blade 14 looks like every other Razer Blade laptop that we’ve seen in the past few years. It’s got the all-aluminum chassis, the RGB keyboard, the three-headed snake logo, and the subtle black vibe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuA9Uj"&gt;But this Razer Blade is very different. It’s the first Blade ever to be powered by an AMD processor. That chip — the Ryzen 9 5900HX — has enabled Razer to put out the most powerful 14-inch gaming laptop ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEwav2"&gt;That’s not just due to the CPU’s raw power. The efficiency of AMD’s product has given Razer the headroom to include Nvidia’s top-of-the-line RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 mobile graphics cards. This is the first 14-inch laptop with those chips. Asus’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;, which has topped all kinds of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists for the past year, maxes out at an RTX 3060. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ypAprJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10622114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="623fmn"&gt;Of course, whether this laptop is a remarkable achievement for Razer is a different question from whether you should actually buy it. The Blade 14 isn’t a cheap system — our test unit costs $2,199.99 — and many folks may justifiably want a bigger screen for that price. But if portability is your priority, this laptop should be on your list. It’s got a mix of performance, specs, and build quality that you won’t find anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Razer Blade 14 keyboard deck. The keys are lit purple." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrwFuulzn21qJ9pwHImXbg5EDi8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675598/mchin_210621_4641_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xtyEYO"&gt;The system I reviewed comes with a 100W RTX 3070, in addition to 16GB of RAM (which is not upgradable), 1TB of SSD storage (expandable up to 2TB), and a 165Hz QHD display. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0369BEA2-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That same price&lt;/a&gt; can also get you a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; with similar GPU and RAM, but with a six-core Intel Core i7 processor and 512GB of storage. The Blade 14 is also thinner and over half a pound lighter: the Blade 15 Base is 4.6 pounds and 0.78 inches thick, while the 14 is 3.92 pounds and 0.66 inches thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iOIRI"&gt;But the Blade 14 is still expensive as ultraportable gaming laptops go — you’re paying a &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-Stealth-13%2FRZ09-03272E12-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 premium&lt;/a&gt; over the FHD 120Hz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13&lt;/a&gt; (which has a much weaker GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q GPU and a lower refresh rate screen) and $200 more than the top &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM300000011/A50184-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-AniMe-Matrix-Ultra-Slim-Gaming-Laptop%2C-14%E2%80%9D-120Hz-PANTONE-Validated-QHD-Display%2C-GeForce-RTX-3060%2C-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HS%2C-32GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-SSD%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-Windows-10-Pro%2C-GA401QM-XS98Q-WH"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; (which has an RTX 3060, but also 32GB of RAM and a fancy dot matrix on its lid). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdGAaI"&gt;Elsewhere, you can get a &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14%2FRZ09-0370AE23-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799.99 Blade 14&lt;/a&gt; with a 144Hz FHD screen and an RTX 3060, and &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14%2FRZ09-0370CEA3-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,799.99&lt;/a&gt; can get you an RTX 3080 with the QHD display. (There’s no touchscreen option.) We haven’t seen an earth-shattering performance difference between RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 systems — 3070s can even outperform 3080s, depending on wattage and clock speeds — so it’s hard to imagine an RTX 3080 Blade 14 really being worth $600 more. (You could literally buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Zephyrus-Gaming-GeForce-Moonlight/dp/B088PDB63Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Zephyrus G14s&lt;/a&gt; for that price.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The arrow keys on the Razer Blade 14 laptop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeQpPkfg2d3pqby6yrRStCwyYXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675599/mchin_210621_4641_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade laptops no longer have the tiny arrow keys that made everyone mad for a while.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5QJJKR"&gt;It seems like Razer has priced this RTX 3070 unit correctly, because the performance I saw was very, very comparable to what we saw from the Blade 15 Base with an RTX 3070. That means it’s blowing smaller laptops, like the Stealth 13 and the Zephyrus G14, out of the water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5zLrkw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10622119"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hol1EW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption &lt;/em&gt;running on its Ultra preset averaged 58fps — just one frame away from the Blade 15 Base. (All games were run at native resolution.) The game averaged 51fps with every slider manually maxed out, which is still decently playable. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn &lt;/em&gt;ran at 70fps, also just one frame worse than the Blade 15 Base. The Blade 14 actually beat the Blade 15 on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; where it averaged 51fps with ray tracing on ultra (the Blade 15 averaged 46fps) and 81fps with ray tracing off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0niDsz"&gt;These numbers make a fairly compelling case for buying the AMD-powered Blade 14 over the Intel-powered Blade 15 Base. The Blade 14 gives you almost identical gaming performance but double the storage at no extra cost. It’s also significantly thinner and lighter, and its eight-core processor will give you an advantage over the Blade 15’s six-core processor in heavy multicore tasks. You’ll want the Blade 15 if you need a bigger screen, of course, but I don’t see many other arguments in its favor at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2m1Bw7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These numbers make a fairly compelling case for buying the AMD-powered Blade 14 over the Intel-powered Blade 15 Base&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aIbxpr"&gt;Just for comparison’s sake, the Blade Stealth 13 only averaged 45fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing off, which is a very noticeable difference. The Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 2060 put up 74fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; sans ray tracing, and 31fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;. Note that both of these laptops were running the games in FHD, so that performance gap is bigger than the numbers make it seem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGFK3X"&gt;Where the Blade 14 did fall behind was in our export test. It took seven minutes and six seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in Adobe Premiere Pro. That’s slower than the Blade 15 Base took, and over a minute slower than the Stealth 13. AMD systems tend to lag behind Intel ones on this task — Intel’s Quick Sync feature is likely a factor. But the Blade 14 did handily beat its &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=32198"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=22790"&gt;siblings&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=44616"&gt;PugetBench for Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt; benchmark, which measures performance on a variety of Premiere Pro tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Blade 14 keyboard seen from above and to the right. The keys are lit a dark pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wav2YGrCOOh-DTY5jyZg6vjzWxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675600/mchin_210621_4641_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can integrate your RGB scheme with your room’s lighting if you have Phillips Hue products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L9969c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10622133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOY9WY"&gt;Battery life was acceptable, but not as tremendous as we’ve seen from some recent AMD systems. I averaged six hours and 12 minutes of continuous work with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s not terrible — it’s still not uncommon to see gaming laptops die after just a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22385493/msi-stealth-15m-gaming-laptop-specs-performance-review"&gt;few hours&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;on battery&lt;/a&gt; — but a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;AMD rigs&lt;/a&gt; are also breaking the eight-hour mark these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUtXGS"&gt;Finally, the Blade 14 includes Razer’s new “next-gen” vapor chamber cooling, which includes dual 88-blade fans with blades that are just 0.1mm thick. Unfortunately, the system struggled to keep up with its chips. I often saw the 5900HX jump into the high 90s (Celsius) during gaming and other intense loads. It was consistently hanging out in the high 80s at other times during testing. The good news is that none of that heat ended up where I could feel it: the bottom of the chassis, keyboard, and palm rests never got uncomfortably toasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QbNWK9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The whole chassis is CNC aluminum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUDuhu"&gt;In case you’ve never used a Razer laptop before, their signature feature (apart from the gaming performance) is the RGB keyboard. The Blade 14 has per-key RGB lighting that you can customize in the Razer Synapse software that comes pre-installed. While many colorful gaming keyboards look obnoxious and garish, Blade keyboards are subtle and chic, in part because there’s almost no backlight bleed from beneath the keys and the fonts are simple, not aggressive. I’d have no problem bringing this Blade to an office or coffee shop — the color is a flourish, rather than a distraction. The touchpad is also quite good, with a smooth texture and no palm rejection issues that I saw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjiuZr"&gt;The whole chassis is CNC aluminum, and it’s quite sturdy, though also a fingerprint magnet. There’s a respectable port selection, which will allow you to power up to three external displays at a time. You get one HDMI 2.1, in addition to two USB-C ports with DisplayPort 1.4, two USB-A ports, an audio jack, a lock slot, and a charging port. This is the =same port selection you’ll find on the Zephyrus G14. No Thunderbolt support, since that’s an Intel feature, but you do get Wi-Fi 6E (Gig+) and Bluetooth 5.2.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Razer Blade 14 seen from above, open, angled to the left. The screen displays the Razer logo on a red and green background. The keys are lit a dark pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwiQhWyWsFdwVat4ELqOUWmQbBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675597/mchin_210621_4641_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a laptop like no other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ahb3Ky"&gt;Games also look great on the QHD display, which allowed me to take full advantage of the frame rates produced here. The screen maxed out at 310 nits in our testing, and it covered 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut. It’s got a matte texture, so I never had any issues with glare in bright settings. It is a 16:9 panel, which is a common aspect ratio to see on gaming laptops, but it does leave less vertical space for work and productivity than a 16:10 or 3:2 display. I’ve been happy to see a number of gaming flagships (such as Asus’ new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22425078/asus-intel-zephyrus-m16-gaming-laptop-tiger-lake-h-chips"&gt;Zephyrus M16&lt;/a&gt;) move over to 16:10 this past year — it makes for gaming laptops that are just a bit more versatile for everyday use as well. I’d hoped Razer might follow suit with this year’s Blades, but it looks like I’ll be waiting longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eofJVQ"&gt;I only have one real complaint with the Blade 14’s chassis features, and that’s the webcam. I’m happy that it does have a webcam — that’s not a given on gaming laptops these days. And it supports Windows Hello facial recognition, which is handy. Unfortunately, the camera is so bad that having it is almost (&lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt;) as bad as not having one at all. It’s quite grainy, and I looked dark even in bright settings. If I were using the Blade as my primary driver, I would probably buy an external camera for my Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CV1AEX"&gt;If you’re looking for the most power-per-pound you can get, the Razer Blade 14 is the ideal gaming laptop for you. Fourteen inches won’t be enough screen for everyone, of course, especially at this price point — and plenty of shoppers may be willing to give up the fancy RGB and a few frames per second in favor of the unbelievable battery life the Zephyrus G14 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;G15&lt;/a&gt; offer. There are a few knocks against the Blade — namely the poor webcam, the chassis’s fingerprint retention, and the steep price tag — but if none of those are dealbreakers for you, I see no reason not to recommend it. There’s really nothing else like it on the market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satya Nadella’s closing Windows 11 remarks were a direct shot across Apple’s bow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zH2ja7Kh13so9X9LQ_KEpKHxBW4=/159x0:1841x1121/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500045/lcimg_933b886b_dbb2_42fd_b7e3_69fe7c89bf06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L3Q5LE"&gt;At the end of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;surprisingly eventful, exciting presentation of Windows 11,&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella came on the video feed to deliver some closing remarks. He laid out his vision for Windows 11 as a “platform for platform creators,” and in doing so, he issued a subtle but nonetheless stinging critique of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9AiLx"&gt;Nadella’s speech was almost entirely about building a case that Windows would be a better platform for creators than either macOS or (especially) iOS. He argued that “there is no personal computing without personal agency,” insisting that users should be more in control of their computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wge8JZ"&gt;Nadella called out the changes Microsoft is making to its app store rules, allowing more types of apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Android apps&lt;/a&gt;, and — most importantly — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store"&gt;allowing apps to use their own payment systems&lt;/a&gt; if they so choose. He said, “A platform can only serve society if its rules allow for this foundational innovation and category creation.” That rhetoric sounds vaguely nice and inspiring out of context, but in the specific context of the current debates, lawsuits, and legislation over app store rules, it’s a sharp and direct critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfSiyZ"&gt;More than anything, though, Nadella and Microsoft are putting their finger on an emerging trend in the debate about app store policies: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525904/fanhouse-apple-tax-app-store-creator-fees"&gt;how they affect individual creators&lt;/a&gt;. Alluding to Ben Thompson’s recent article about “&lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/"&gt;sovereign writers&lt;/a&gt;,” Nadella says, “Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.” Microsoft even went so far as to build a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548804/microsoft-windows-11-news-feed-creators-tipping"&gt;direct tipping feature for creators&lt;/a&gt; into Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvdVLP"&gt;It’s fair to call this critique opportunistic. After all, Microsoft itself tried to build an app store ecosystem for Windows that utterly failed to match the level of success we’ve seen for the iPhone (or Android, for that matter). It’s a truism that, in tech, the underdog always calls for openness until they’re the top dog — and Microsoft’s app store is definitely the underdog. But just because a critique is opportunistic doesn’t mean it’s not &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c59K8H"&gt;Nadella ends by alluding to &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=88CV8JOYUmsC&amp;amp;pg=PA453&amp;amp;lpg=PA453&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuthors+can+be+divided+into+meteors,+planets+and+fixed+stars.+The+meteors+produce+a+loud+momentary+effect;+we+look+up,+shout+%27see+there!%27+and+then+they+are+gone+for+ever.+The+planets+and+comets+last+for+a+much+longer+time....The+fixed+stars+alone+are+constant+and+unalterable;+their+position+in+the+firmament+is+fixed;+they+have+their+own+light+and+are+at+all+times+active,+because+they+do+not+alter+their+appearance+through+a+change+in+our+standpoint,+for+they+have+no+parallax.+Unlike+the+others,+they+do+not+belong+to+one+system+(nation)+alone,+but+to+the+world.+But+just+because+they+are+situated+so+high,+their+light+usually+requires+many+years+before+it+becomes+visible+to+the+inhabitants+of+earth.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=X9sdKDb2Ji&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U3w_Wil1YTochE-X7hyUbSBxxGvGw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi797am7LDxAhUS6p4KHVakA-8Q6AEwAHoECAIQAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuthors%20can%20be%20divided%20into%20meteors%2C%20planets%20and%20fixed%20stars.%20The%20meteors%20produce%20a%20loud%20momentary%20effect%3B%20we%20look%20up%2C%20shout%20'see%20there!'%20and%20then%20they%20are%20gone%20for%20ever.%20The%20planets%20and%20comets%20last%20for%20a%20much%20longer%20time....The%20fixed%20stars%20alone%20are%20constant%20and%20unalterable%3B%20their%20position%20in%20the%20firmament%20is%20fixed%3B%20they%20have%20their%20own%20light%20and%20are%20at%20all%20times%20active%2C%20because%20they%20do%20not%20alter%20their%20appearance%20through%20a%20change%20in%20our%20standpoint%2C%20for%20they%20have%20no%20parallax.%20Unlike%20the%20others%2C%20they%20do%20not%20belong%20to%20one%20system%20(nation)%20alone%2C%20but%20to%20the%20world.%20But%20just%20because%20they%20are%20situated%20so%20high%2C%20their%20light%20usually%20requires%20many%20years%20before%20it%20becomes%20visible%20to%20the%20inhabitants%20of%20earth.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;this quote&lt;/a&gt; from Arthur Schopenhauer (without naming him, likely because he was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#Women"&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;problematic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="M4bjVJ"&gt;Authors can be divided into meteors, planets and fixed stars. The meteors produce a loud momentary effect; we look up, shout ‘see there!’ and then they are gone for ever. The planets and comets last for a much longer time. ... The fixed stars alone are constant and unalterable; their position in the firmament is fixed; they have their own light and are at all times active, because they do not alter their appearance through a change in our standpoint, for they have no parallax. Unlike the others, they do not belong to one system (nation) alone, but to the world. But just because they are situated so high, their light usually requires many years before it becomes visible to the inhabitants of earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7o9BgT"&gt;That’s a long way of pointing out that despite the short-term incentives, Nadella is playing a very long game with Windows 11. Just as Google and Apple build their companies around their business models, so does Microsoft. But Microsoft’s business model has nothing to do with selling Windows or even getting a cut of app sales anymore. It’s about Microsoft 365, Azure, and enterprise services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpUYcC"&gt;When Nadella says Windows is “a platform for platform creators,” Microsoft’s other services are some of those other platforms — that happen to work well on Windows. For the time being, Nadella’s argument is that Windows 11 is big enough and broad enough to make room for others, too — and that other platforms are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o23hi7"&gt;Nadella’s full remarks are below. And just as this story was published, Nadella himself tweeted the core part of his speech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iTqga3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers, and with Windows 11 we have a renewed sense of Windows’ role in the world. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xHldf38B8d"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xHldf38B8d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1408131637582336001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="SzLIs9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iZl0DE"&gt;I’m really excited to be here with you all. Today marks a major milestone in the history of Windows. It’s the beginning of a new generation. I’m excited by what we have shown you today and how we are reimagining everything from the operating system itself to the browser to the store and the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoeHzr"&gt;And I want to reflect briefly on how we got here. Throughout its history, Windows has been a democratizing force for the world. Windows has created entirely new categories for both consumers and businesses. It’s led to many of the world’s most successful software categories, from communications and productivity to design and business applications, each of which has created their own ecosystems. The web itself was born and grew up on Windows. It’s driven silicon innovation device innovation. It’s enabled so many people — including hobbyists, developers, and entrepreneurs — to all dream big; turn their ideas into reality; and monetize their creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sb7XW"&gt;Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvLovj"&gt;With Windows, you can consume apps and build apps. You can play games and design games. You can buy a PC and build a PC. You can join your community and create your community. You can buy from a business and start your own business. With Windows 11, we have a renewed sense of Windows’ role in the world. As I look ahead, I see three clear opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lsd463"&gt;First, Windows recognizes that there is no personal computing without personal agency. Personal computing requires choice, and we need to nurture and grow our own agency over computing itself. We want to remove the barriers that too often exist today and provide real choice and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roBAIJ"&gt;We need to be empowered to choose the applications we run, the content we consume, the people we connect to, and even how we allocate our own attention. Operating systems and devices should mold to our needs, not the other way around. That’s why we are making it easier for you to connect with the people you want, the content you want, the apps you want across all devices you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73wTi6"&gt;Second, Windows is the stage for the world’s creation. As a creator, every time you pick up a Windows device, it becomes a stage for your inspiration, so you can dream big and create something profound and lasting. Creation is going through a sea change as the balance between consumption and creation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Js77NO"&gt;With this new generation of Windows, we are unleashing the innovation and ingenuity inherent in each of us. We want to foster these virtuous loops between content, consumption, and commerce — driven by communities for everyone. These cycles should flow freely, giving people frictionless access to apps, files, games, movies, shows, content, and communities that matter to them. We want to empower you to produce and inspire you to create. It’s why we’re introducing a complete new user experience in helping you be more productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aoy8Q2"&gt;And finally, Windows isn’t just an operating system; it’s a platform for platform creators. It allows for the broadest of design spaces, enabling people to build their own businesses and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmCPfQ"&gt;Today, the world needs a more open platform, one that allows apps to become platforms in their own right. Windows is a platform where things that are bigger than Windows can be born, like the web. That’s our aspiration with Windows 11, to be the platform for the next web, the next transformational software category, the next personalized content business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNpAVy"&gt;A platform can only serve society if its rules allow for this foundational innovation and category creation. It’s why we’re introducing new store commerce models and policies, and creating new opportunities for local publishers, and supporting even more apps with Android apps on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SInLfo"&gt;This is the first version of a new era of Windows. We’re building for the next decade and beyond. And when I reflect on those chapters to come, I’m reminded of an analogy from a 19th century philosopher who compared creators to objects in our Solar System. He wrote about meteors that flash but fade away. Planets that burned longer, but whose energy is confined to their own orbit — and compared them to stars that are constant and light the path of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uer7Zd"&gt;That’s our ambition with Windows: to help other stars and entire constellations to be born and thrive. I am incredibly proud of what Windows has achieved and how it is fostered lasting opportunity for others. And I look forward to seeing what you achieve with Windows 11 and how it’ll unlock enduring opportunity for people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXmLFk"&gt;Thank you all very, very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Teamsters pass nationwide Amazon unionization campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gq65YcFikVDsomKSk4-dXsrCUV0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69500025/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xffayK"&gt;The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is launching a nationwide campaign to unionize Amazon workers. On Thursday, the union &lt;a href="https://teamster.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/62421CONVENTIONRESOLUTIONAMAZON.pdf"&gt;passed a resolution&lt;/a&gt; to make the “Amazon Project” a top priority and said it would commit “all resources necessary” to making the initiative successful. News of the campaign &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg7pp/the-teamsters-announce-coordinated-nationwide-project-to-unionize-amazon"&gt;was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0fmfi"&gt;“Amazon presents a massive threat to working-class communities and good jobs in the logistics industry,” said Randy Korgan, national director of the Amazon Project, in a statement. “Amazon workers are calling for safer and better working conditions, and with today’s resolution, we are activating the full force of our union to support them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWI0qF"&gt;The vote came during the union’s annual convention on June 24th. Of the 1,632 delegates present, 1,562 voted to pass the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZNctt"&gt;As part of the initiative, the Teamsters will create a special Amazon Division tasked with “taking on the threat that is Amazon for the next five years.” It’s designed to help the Teamsters roll out a unified strategy across its 500 local unions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ai2UnB"&gt;Korgan told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; the union has been planning the campaign for years. “We’ve been working on this for quite some time—well before Bessemer broke out,” he said, referring to the recent union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y51vHP"&gt;In April, the National Labor Relations Board announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, had voted against unionizing&lt;/a&gt; with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The news came after months of Amazon’s brutal union-busting campaign, which included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;pressuring the postal service to install a mailbox&lt;/a&gt; outside the warehouse to collect ballots, which gave some workers the impression that Amazon controlled the vote. RWDSU challenged the results of the election in a complaint filed with the NLRB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJLWWW"&gt;“In my more than two decades of service as Teamsters General President, I’ve yet to see a threat quite like the one Amazon presents to hardworking people, small businesses, the logistics industry and our nation’s middle class,” said Teamsters president James P. Hoffa in a statement. “Our 1.4 million Teamster members, their families and communities stand together in solidarity with Amazon workers, and we commit our union’s full support as they build worker power for a better future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6lQFF"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9OcG1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwL4pt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything Microsoft is removing from Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ly7cIMG27qgyUcL6m3cRu9fu7O0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499920/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_9.54.09_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft announced Windows 11 on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ot9MNg"&gt;Microsoft just announced Windows 11, which brings a new design, a centered Start menu, the ability to run Android apps, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;and a whole lot more&lt;/a&gt;. But alongside everything new revealed on Thursday, Microsoft also shared details on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications"&gt;features that will be deprecated or removed&lt;/a&gt;, and you might want to check out what’s changing in case there’s anything you might have to adjust to in your day-to-day use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMPNka"&gt;Here are some big changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bpkmCR"&gt;Cortana is no longer part of the boot experience, and you can read my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548899/microsoft-windows-11-cortana-experience-taskbar"&gt;Monica Chin’s feels about that here&lt;/a&gt;. It also won’t be pinned to the taskbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dP9YNO"&gt;Live Tiles will no longer be available in the Start menu. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163687/microsoft-new-windows-10-start-menu-design-live-tiles-changes"&gt;had been exploring de-emphasizing them&lt;/a&gt;, but in Windows 11, they’ll officially be gone. Also, anything you’ve pinned to the Start menu won’t come along for the ride, and you can’t resize it — yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gp21ui"&gt;There’s no more tablet mode, and Windows 10’s lightweight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095424/microsoft-windows-10-s-mode-free-upgrades"&gt;S mode&lt;/a&gt; (arguably also handy for tablets) will only be available in Windows 11 Home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nUIhB2"&gt;Skype is one of a few apps that will no longer be included in clean installs of the new OS. The change, while major, isn’t too surprising, given that Teams will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;directly integrated as part of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yry5Wq"&gt;OneNote for Windows 10 also won’t be included in clean installs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Bs7lc"&gt;In addition, Microsoft is no longer including Paint 3D and 3D Viewer, which were important enough to be the focus of one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/11/15256214/microsoft-windows-10-creators-update-features-review"&gt;of the biggest Windows 10 updates&lt;/a&gt;, in clean installs. Microsoft has been moving in this direction already — the two apps weren’t included in fresh installs of a &lt;a href="https://mspoweruser.com/goodbye-creators-update-microsoft-removes-paint3d-and-3d-viewer-from-windows-10/"&gt;Windows 10 Insider build from March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qooSrD"&gt;All of those apps aren’t gone forever, though — you’ll still be able to download them from the Microsoft Store if you want. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ozZPur"&gt;You will no longer be able to pin the taskbar to any side of the screen — it can only be aligned to the bottom in Windows 11. Apps also can’t customize areas of the taskbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="77UQju"&gt;To see everything that’s changing, check out the full list &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications"&gt;on Microsoft’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft teases new File Explorer for Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyTBT8fnhHdqwxYVjZSNVq1sksw=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499901/filexplorer.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k0nMiT"&gt;Microsoft made Windows 11 official today, but one part of the operating system the company didn’t show during its event was File Explorer. Just like the rest of Windows 11, it looks like File Explorer is getting a significant overhaul. In a video entitled “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7y1S3wIysg"&gt;how Windows 11 is being designed&lt;/a&gt;,” Microsoft reveals the new File Explorer UI alongside some changes to the Microsoft Office UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJOv44"&gt;It appears that the ribbon interface that’s typically been a part of File Explorer and Office is going away. In a brief appearance in the video, you can see a File Explorer that looks more optimized for touch, with controls for file and folder operations built into the top section. As only the top section is shown, it’s difficult to know what else has changed, but we’ll likely see more once a preview version of Windows 11 is released early next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new File Explorer for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FSjsc1"&gt;This new File Explorer also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348639/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-new-icons-system-update"&gt;includes the new icons&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft has been working on as part of a bigger visual overhaul to Windows 11. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like we’re getting the tabbed interface that designers have been dreaming for recently, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385247/windows-file-explorer-design-concept-tabs-nested-folders"&gt;heavily simplified File Explorer concepts&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yrZh6"&gt;Alongside the File Explorer appearance, Microsoft also demonstrated what looks like a new UI for Office apps on Windows 11. This includes a collapsible ribbon menu, with rounded corners and what looks like a bigger focus on touch improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yUxUc"&gt;Microsoft didn’t mention a new design for Office during its Windows 11 event today, either. The company has been gradually refining the design of Office over the past year, with a much bigger focus on simplifying Office across the web, desktop, and mobile. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332483/microsoft-office-future-ui-design-ribbon-command-bar-interface"&gt;Microsoft also teased similar UI changes to Office last year&lt;/a&gt;, but the company hasn’t fully rolled them out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘The little handheld that could’: examining the Vita’s impact a decade later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS Vita" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7eHOT6HhNOus7yhi0iydIW6WvM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499863/vpavic_191127_untitled_0019_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The story of Sony’s beloved handheld&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ibtNYp"&gt;Christian Phillips still remembers the most jaw-dropping moment he experienced on the PlayStation Vita — and it was something that was never actually released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wDoIX"&gt;Phillips, a former senior director at Sony, describes a tech demo that ultimately led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18514683/days-gone-review-ps4-open-world-zombie-game"&gt;the PS4 game &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime after shipping &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Golden Abyss&lt;/em&gt;, Bend Studio showed leadership the Vita tech demo that was similar to the famous &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU0DNCV22dU"&gt;Jerusalem scene&lt;/a&gt; in the movie &lt;em&gt;World War Z&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HQwG2"&gt;The demo had a scene with a horde of zombies scrambling up a wall. The main character scales a wall and the zombies keep piling up like ants, and then the camera pulled back and you could just see this mass of zombies. What Phillips describes is very similar to the &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGej8K1r8KI"&gt;gameplay demo&lt;/a&gt; shown during E3 2016. Bend was given some latitude to see what else it could do to push the hardware, as it was the team’s responsibility as a first-party studio to showcase what was possible on Vita for the development community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0B0k9e"&gt;“Now this is 100 percent speculation on my part. What likely seemed to have happened was that [Bend] was really pushing the PlayStation Vita’s hardware, but then the PS4 initiative really kicked off,” Phillips says. “Then we were all chartered with supporting the PS4, being there with killer content and a game the size of &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt; takes a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBBMI9"&gt;Ten years on, the Vita remains a cult favorite platform. But even if the handheld wasn’t the big success Sony expected, it eventually led to the mega-successful launch of the PlayStation 4 in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IiiBXT"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9UVjZM"&gt;Sony started working on the Vita in 2007 during the middle of the PlayStation Portable’s (PSP) life cycle. The organization saw a significant market opportunity for handheld gaming and realized that the strategic fit for PlayStation was to place console quality games onto a portable device. Sony had aspirations to go that route with PSP, but the software development kit was hacked and Sony never had the chance to develop certain PSP games how it wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgkQCa"&gt;When it comes to game development, developers look at install base, software attachment, and opportunities for different revenue streams. The PSP’s install base was very significant, so that first check was marked, but the other two weren’t. Particularly, the SDK hack created a fear that studios would lose money because players could easily pirate their games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOtaXD"&gt;As a result, the Vita was seen as the opportunity to surround consumers with console-quality portable gaming away from the home and then invite them to actual console gaming when they returned. While that may have been the initial pitch, the Vita eventually became known for other things like the Remote Play function and its incredible lineup of indie games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Jprce"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Vita was way ahead of its time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2rtj1s"&gt;The Vita was ahead of its time in many aspects. “We built the Vita features accordingly. As an example, the PS Vita had an OLED screen that was spectacular,” says former Sony vice president of marketing John Koller. “We only just saw these screens appear in TV manufacturing recently.” Referencing the “play anywhere” aspect, he adds, “this is where the Vita was way ahead of its time. This positioning has since been utilized by Xbox Series X, Google Stadia, and most mobile platforms.” Additionally, the Nintendo Switch took this concept and made it more popular than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZ4NHM"&gt;Sony also saw the Vita’s launch as an opportunity to continue to build its console business. This was still during the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Wii era, and Sony wanted to bring both the handheld and console platforms together with a “play console quality games anywhere you want” strategy. However, while the Vita did allow for these kinds of experiences, the reality is that there were a lot of asterisks that muted the way Sony could message that proposition. The company thought that the Vita’s 3G model would have helped legitimize this position, but it turns out that consumers much preferred the Wi-Fi model due to out of pocket costs and usage. Consequently, Sony pivoted to a Wi-Fi centric business model which ended up limiting the company’s messaging about the system. This also changed how publishers developed for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHcX53"&gt;Therein lies the core of why the Vita didn’t take off as well as its predecessor: the desired positioning needed to change because both the overall technology landscape and consumer demand were shifting quickly. While &lt;a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/analysis/platform_totals/"&gt;exact numbers&lt;/a&gt; are hard to pinpoint, the PSP was estimated to have sold a little over 80 million units over its lifetime while the Vita only managed a fraction of that at an estimated 16 million. (It wasn’t just Sony that struggled, Nintendo likewise saw a big drop in sales moving from the DS to the 3DS.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS Vita" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6bLwqdtsMIxky-PaXQrjc3RXsCU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19423516/vpavic_191127_untitled_0019_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TgZXrs"&gt;One of the biggest things that Sony had misread was the impact that smartphones had on the gaming industry. Internally, Sony considered smartphone gaming as “just good enough for gameplay,” and scoffingly referred to it as just something to kill time while waiting for your coffee or at the airport. Philips notes that this attitude was very pervasive in the gaming industry back then. “Tablets were really what we looked at when it came to what is now known as mobile games,” he adds. “We felt like that was a more direct head-to-head potential competitor, because they had the processing power. They had the screen acreage and all of that touch functionality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ku4cuv"&gt;A few people at Sony figured that the technology in iPhones and iPads around 2010-2011 would soon pull ahead of Xbox 360s. However, this wasn’t incorporated into the Vita’s strategic planning. “As a result, I think the PS Vita, while ahead of its time in many ways and has a lot of features and functions, launched at exactly the wrong time in terms of market opportunity,” Koller explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOx09j"&gt;The other elephant in the room was Nintendo, which had dominated the handheld gaming market since the Game Boy’s debut in 1989. When developing for Vita, Sony obviously was concerned about how it’d stack up to the Nintendo 3DS and its popularity and install base, though the 3DS’s initial price point was also lower and Nintendo’s game portfolio was much different compared to Sony’s. The organization was worried about Nintendo, but Sony did have some advantages, such as the 3DS having less third-party support and an audience that skewed younger. Nintendo was very biased toward its first-party development; both Sony and other publishers were aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jnNrg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was the opportunity for everybody to win.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6vwCou"&gt;Phillips also thinks that Nintendo’s handhelds were great entries into the portable gaming space. However, there was also room for products like PSP and Vita to coexist, just like with home consoles. “There was the opportunity for everybody to win. But what [Sony] could bring to the table would be a very unique gaming experience that couldn’t be had on a phone or Nintendo 3DS,” says Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xEqsU"&gt;Several sources say that Sony also had to contend with the emergence of digital distribution. Broadband internet was starting to gain momentum but was still underdeveloped in many global territories. Additionally, physical retailers were losing their grip on the consumer, and games were becoming more sophisticated. All of these changes started unfolding as the Vita launch approached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkIcp8"&gt;The PSP utilized the Universal Media Disc, or UMD, for its games and other media. However, the Vita used cartridges and select PSP games were backwards compatible digitally. When it came to which medium for game storage the Vita would use, Sony looked at a few options. The PlayStation Network marketing and operations team was adamant about having the Vita be 100 percent digital. While this would be a reasonable decision in 2021, as seen with PlayStation 5 Digital Edition and Xbox Series S, it wasn’t feasible in 2012. The lack of global broadband adoption at the time, along with extremely long download times, made this path one that wasn’t very consumer friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiUBHa"&gt;The exact opposite side of the spectrum was considered as well, with Sony utilizing a physical retail model which would have required consumers to go into stores in order to download content or purchase game cartridges. This 100 percent physical store only option also didn’t seem consumer-friendly as it wasn’t entirely convenient for some people and was quickly thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="swf4Yz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10619170"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="31SkDK"&gt;There was also the possibility of using UMDs again, but publishers were concerned about the sheer operational costs of them. UMDs were expensive and had a capacity ceiling. If Sony had gone down this route, then it would have had to either increase the price point of games or ask publishers to absorb the cost. The former was obviously not favorable for the consumer, and the latter would result in a decreased amount of games available for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37lmRI"&gt;The last option, which is the one Sony ended up choosing, was a hybrid with both physical cartridges and digital downloads. Having both these avenues allowed consumers to make their own choices, kept the costs lower for publishers so game development for the platform would continue, and retail stores would stay invested in the business. At the time, this was considered the best decision available, and luckily, that seemed to turn out to be right in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS Vita TV 1024px" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_so4B3KgBzIDgwjxG_ZS6QnP7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3650897/DSCF2940-1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayStation Vita TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AQizyt"&gt;One of the most debated strategies internally at PlayStation was the move to use proprietary memory cards on the Vita. This was one of the most contentious aspects about owning the system, as the memory cards were incredibly expensive. At the time, there was significant concern around the PSP game piracy situation and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/04/26/playstation-network-indefinitely-sony-deals-hacker-attack"&gt;the 2011 PlayStation Network hack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0B7Om"&gt;These events affected a few parts of the Vita’s strategic plans, most notably how to secure content. That was the reason why there were so many options considered when it came to physical media, downloads, and memory cards. Security was a huge priority after the effects of the hack, and third-party publishers needed to be assured that their content would be protected if they were to develop for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tC01fd"&gt;Sony focused on the ideas of proprietary technology and owning all factors of production at the time. The organization mostly didn’t want to be beholden to part shortages and market fluctuations that would harm the business. The proprietary memory cards were expensive but Sony tried to soften that blow with various bundles and retail promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CGSNOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The epitome of a forced product into a market that didn’t necessarily demand the product.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PfA7C9"&gt;Sony was also shifting its focus from being a product and engineering-focused organization to a brand and audience-centered one. This initiative had massive and positive ramifications across many different areas of the business, such as eventually creating the legendary “Sharing Games on PS4” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; in response to the fan backlash surrounding Xbox One’s initial DRM policy. Former PlayStation executives Kaz Hirai and Andrew House had huge roles in making this approach a mandate across the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghWnie"&gt;“I was leading the brand effort across all of PlayStation and fundamentally shared their view that a shift to a gamer-first approach would have a significant positive impact on the business,” Koller explains. “This turned out to be true and was born out with the PS4 launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xyv1UO"&gt;There was also quite a bit of resistance internally on this endeavor from entrenched teams. The marketing leadership needed to work out issues in real time as Sony would evolve into a more progressive, consumer-first model that allowed it to succeed in the future. An example of this shift was the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/29/5156898/sony-playstation-vita-tv-review"&gt;PlayStation Vita TV&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the PlayStation TV, a non-handheld microconsole variant of the Vita that could play most of its games on a television screen via HDMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5I0sX"&gt;Koller says that the old days of creating a product and then throwing it over the fence to the marketing department to make it a successful launch were over. The PS Vita TV was a part of those final days. The product wasn’t a consumer demanded one, but rather one that was somewhat Frankenstein-ed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKQvH2"&gt;“This is all background because the PS Vita TV was born of the last vestiges of the engineering and network operations team’s ideals, thoughts, hopes, and dreams. It was the epitome of a forced product into a market that didn’t necessarily demand the product,” Koller continues. “We were able to launch it and sell what we could, but it was going to always be a product that was saved by creative marketing within each territory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tGQZaa"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nBwB92"&gt;In 2021, the Nintendo Switch has largely taken the place of where Vita used to be. The hybrid system is a big seller, and it had a few advantages that Sony didn’t with the Vita. First and foremost, the Switch launched in 2017 into a world with much greater broadband penetration that allowed for easier and frictionless downloads and online gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7J27d"&gt;The second differentiator was the commitment toward first-party titles that Nintendo demonstrated. PlayStation was trying to institute challenging concepts like crossplay and cross-save between console and mobile devices, and even trying to emulate or port console games to Vita in order to realize the “console gaming on the go” vision. However, Nintendo figured out that it could just create “console-ish” games on Switch that are deep, rich, and fun but didn’t necessarily require an expensive box to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PN3I2"&gt;“With that, [Nintendo] also had an organizational wide commitment to development of those games, which I personally believe PlayStation lacked,” Koller explains. “I never felt like PlayStation’s first-party studio teams were fully invested in development of Vita titles. They wanted to create PS4 games instead and Vita was almost viewed as a secondary platform, which was unfortunate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6PmeSM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Launching game platforms is really hard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCbo8F"&gt;Phillips notes that first-party support moves in the direction of where Sony needs to plant the next flag. It wasn’t just aspects like financial factors or more upside with the PS4 to be had. It was more so that the PS4 business was a huge investment, and first-party studios absolutely needed to be there to support the consumers and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUws4"&gt;He also thinks Sony ended up happy with the performance of the Vita. Outside the Sony walls, consumers may have perceived it differently, as the handheld wasn’t the same monster in terms of sales that a home console was. “I think that at the end of the day, it was about ‘Okay, now we need to make sure that the PS4 succeeds. So first party, that’s where your resources need to go’,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73QunF"&gt;The last distinction is that it was very clear Nintendo was determined to make the Switch a success. The secret to any platform launch is that the first six months are critical. Two things need to be established immediately: hardware sales momentum and game attachment rate. These two factors weigh heavily on publisher and developer decisions to continue investing in game development on a platform over a long period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBzNrv"&gt;Koller says that Nintendo’s dedication was refreshing to see. “I launched six PlayStation platforms, and as the old internal gaming industry saying goes: ‘launching game platforms is really hard.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS Vita" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEcDgwuIkAUkHbSuO78-gnhwwpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19427601/vpavic_191127_untitled_0028_Edit.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDXv02"&gt;When Sony started working on the Vita in 2007, the organization quickly realized that if it didn’t get the product out to the market by 2012, then it would launch on top of the PS4, which was not optimal. The timing really stacked and crept up as the product evolved, mostly because of all of the internal debates regarding its direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUVXaI"&gt;Koller says that if he could go back in time, he would have done everything possible to get the Vita to launch earlier. It needed to get ahead of the smartphone gaming wave, as the Vita unfortunately released right into the heat of it. Additionally, the Vita needed more time to thrive on its own during the later-stage PS3 environment and pre-PS4 era. “We made the PS4 such a successful launch that it really eclipsed the sun for virtually all other PlayStation products,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsaeY2"&gt;He also would have put in more effort to co-develop critical franchise titles that Sony needed to get more platform momentum during the first few years of the Vita’s life. Investing in more indie games throughout the system’s life would have helped as well, as it would have allowed it to have an even stronger launch. “This would have built out the game portfolio in a much fuller way and captured a bit of the indie game magic that was starting to bubble to the surface at that time,” Koller says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iDYk7"&gt;At Sony, there was an initiative called #BuildingTheList, which started as a geeky conversation between former Sony head of second -party games, Gio Corsi, and former vice president of third-party Relations, Adam Boyes. Corsi tells me that they were discussing potential partnerships, modern classic titles, and retro titles that would be cool to bring over to PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ss5zlR"&gt;Corsi was shocked at how many people responded to the hashtag on social media and realized that many consumers never had an outlet to talk directly to someone and get their voices heard. He notes that fans of “the little handheld that could” had always been screaming from the rooftops about getting any and all games onto the Vita, whether it’d be brand-new experiences or classics. “When I came onboard, I was already a Vita believer and I just wanted to try and get games onto not only the main consoles like PS3 and PS4, but also Vita, frankly because I wanted to play those games, too!” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5O9d8"&gt;Corsi approached third-party developers and indie teams from a point of passion. He genuinely wanted to help these teams get their games onto the Vita. There were many developers who were fans of the system but didn’t have the time, money, or manpower to focus on bringing their titles onto it. That’s where his team would step in; it wasn’t about enticing them, but making them feel comfortable and helping them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pdEr3Y"&gt;
&lt;p id="zo09VB"&gt;There was also the aspect of Japanese games and how well the Vita did over in its home country. Sony knew that the Vita would be more popular in Japan, much like how the organization also knew the console market over there would somewhat lag compared to Western territories. User behavior is just different, and Japan is much more advanced from a mobile gaming perspective. Japanese gamers also preferred local multiplayer in their titles, like in &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, while places like the United States and Europe took more to online multiplayer. This difference changed development conversations considerably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d2Nnn"&gt;Numerous developers saw the opportunity in Japan and thought about how to create games specifically for that region even if those games might have struggled in the West. “Ultimately, Japan became an exceptionally strong market for Vita and I think this kept the handheld alive longer than it would have been otherwise,” Koller says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="suFo31"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It makes sense in the head but not in the heart.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfrHRK"&gt;Corsi also painted a picture of Japan’s sprawling support for the Vita. He remembers walking onto the video game section of a giant shop in Akihabara and there was an entire section dedicated just for the Vita, which he describes as just absolutely glorious. There were lots of physical games, many that he had never even known about, as well as cases, accessories, stickers, and shirts. “I thought, ‘sweet fancy Moses, I wish we could have this back in North America.’ But it’s a different market in a different region. It makes sense in the head but not in the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wExjgP"&gt;PlayStation system architect Mark Cerny played a massive role in virtually all of Sony’s console launches. He opened up his work to the marketing department to ensure that the brand, the consumer’s voice, and deep cultural insights were embedded in a launch. Koller says that Cerny is a bona fide genius. “I always appreciated him and his approach,” he explains. “I also really enjoyed the way that all of the regions worked together. Japan’s engineers led the launch, but brought in highly knowledgeable product teams from around the globe to help create a truly global launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9ni92"&gt;The launch of the PS4 was far different from the PS2 and PS3 launches. The sense of product and brand level collaboration ended up greatly benefiting Sony when it had launched the system in 2013. In many ways, PlayStation Vita’s launch laid the groundwork for the PlayStation 4’s incredible start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyX7bw"&gt;Koller notes that those at Sony always said that PlayStation started as an island off the coast of the organization that eventually grew into the primary division and operating income driver within the entire company. “I’m very proud of all of the PlayStation platforms that I launched, but the PS Vita will always be a special moment in my career,” he says. “[It’s] not necessarily because of sales success, which was moderate, but because we were able to marshal the entire organization to challenge itself and try to win in a very difficult market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="webOEl"&gt;Gio Corsi describes the Vita as imperfectly perfect. Sure, it could have had more games, recognition, and design updates, but in a way that also helped give the system some of its “street cred” along with its persistence and somewhat legendary cult status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YF6Fhl"&gt;“I love the PlayStation Vita, it remains one of my favorite platforms and I still play it today. Yes, the industry and technology are moving forward and that’s very exciting as both a gamer and a game maker,” says Corsi. “But for a time there was a PlayStation handheld that was making a little noise and it’s commendable that there is a base of fans who celebrate it. I do, too — long love the Vita.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 revealed in new leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5sOxxbmLf5fp1AedV2sW4qIxb4=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499738/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4y0Cej"&gt;Samsung’s 2021 foldable phones have been revealed in a new leak that shows off the design of the both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, which are rumored to be released sometime over the summer. The picture comes from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?s=21"&gt;noted phone leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, who posted the image to Twitter with the additional information that the Z Fold 3 is “definitely S-Pen compatible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6OFitp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not always. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SzBFpRKF5s"&gt;https://t.co/SzBFpRKF5s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uf6rJAQhli"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uf6rJAQhli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1408107239903223808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aXPRs1"&gt;Blass’ first image doesn’t reveal too much about the design of the larger foldable, given that it shows the interior of the device (which appears similar to last year’s Z Fold 2). A second image posted shows off a slimmed down camera bump and a new “Fold Edition” S Pen stylus that will help the new foldable stand out — and potentially replace Samsung’s Galaxy Note phone in the company’s increasingly crowded smartphone line. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZULQKv1zeeuJKAzVV0v4dZAQrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22679450/E4qkWBHXwAgIQ_W.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1NCfLs"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3, on the other hand, has a more substantial redesign visible, with a larger external display and a two-tone color scheme for the now-vertically stacked cameras that are reminiscent of the Galaxy S21’s revamped design from earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktbd6u"&gt;The leak also reveals that Samsung appears to be counting the Z Flip and its 5G variant, the Z Flip 5G, as separate iterations of the phone, allowing it to name the latest model of the vertical foldable the Z Flip 3 — nicely matching the Z Fold 3’s numbering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0HfnR"&gt;It’s not entirely clear when Samsung will be officially announcing the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3, although the company does have an event scheduled for MWC 2021 on June 28th, where it’s promised to showcase the “Galaxy ecosystem” as well as its new watch experience that Samsung is collaborating with Google with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pokfvh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:00pm EST: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional image of Z Fold 3 and its new S-Pen stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internet sex trafficking law FOSTA-SESTA is almost never used, says government report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="court house" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gH9PKdchj0ECoFL4kTXbVMhDd3c=/3x0:1022x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499673/court-house-federal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rvgXaR"&gt;It’s been over three years since former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223720/trump-signs-fosta-sesta-sex-trafficking-section-230-law"&gt;signed FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt;, a major carveout to internet speech law Section 230. Proponents called the law — which adds penalties for hosting illegal sex work-related content — necessary to prevent online trafficking. But &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-385.pdf"&gt;a new government report&lt;/a&gt; suggests it remains rarely used, even as legislators push for other, similar platform liability laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6P7wx"&gt;Earlier this week, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a legally mandated report on the first three years of FOSTA-SESTA. The oversight agency compiled data from court records and corroborated it with other organizations, including the nonprofit Human Trafficking Legal Center. It found that over three years, the Department of Justice filed just one case under its rules against promoting or recklessly disregarding sex trafficking: a June 2020 charge against the owner of cityxguide.com, which remains in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eQqNwR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s ‘no definitive reason’ why so few people use the law&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5AwOK"&gt;Justice Department officials claimed the law is potentially useful because it lets them push for longer criminal sentences and add more charges that might stick to defendants. But they told the GAO that FOSTA hasn’t been used more for a couple of reasons. Firstly, prosecutors can’t apply it to offenses from before the law was signed in 2018. Secondly, when going after platforms that allegedly facilitate trafficking, “prosecutors have had success using racketeering and money laundering charges against those who control such online platforms in the past.” Major alleged sex work hub Backpage.com, for instance, was seized before the law was signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKA8Sl"&gt;In early 2020, former Attorney General &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144223/justice-department-section-230-debate-liability-doj"&gt;William Barr argued&lt;/a&gt; criminal prosecution wasn’t the only reason laws like FOSTA-SESTA mattered; he called prosecution a “limited tool” that should “work hand in hand” with civil cases brought by people who survived sex trafficking. But the GAO also found limited evidence of civil FOSTA-SESTA cases. As of March 2021, it had identified a single person who sought civil damages under the law, and the case was dismissed with no damages awarded. An April lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399306/reddit-lawsuit-child-sexual-abuse-material-fosta-sesta-section-230"&gt;referenced FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt;, but it relied on other statutes and had little to do with conventional sex trafficking claims. Overall, “criminal restitution has not been sought and civil damages have not been awarded” under the law, it notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FCMtiF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FOSTA-SESTA created a preemptive online crackdown&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikTIct"&gt;The report says there’s “no definitive reason” why the law has been used so rarely. “One possible reason is that the [FOSTA-SESTA] provision that allows for civil remedy is relatively new and untested,” it says. It also suggests that civil cases are easier to file if there’s been a related criminal conviction — and as mentioned above, that hasn’t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcWwoU"&gt;FOSTA-SESTA was signed just days after the Justice Department seized Backpage.com, and the GAO says it’s impossible to disentangle the impact of both moves. Either way, it concludes that many commercial sex platforms fragmented or moved overseas soon after, while many of their users shifted to using conventional social media — which it says has made gathering evidence and prosecuting cases more difficult. This difficulty could also have slowed the filing of FOSTA-SESTA-related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuTMvM"&gt;The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which supports FOSTA-SESTA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302850/section-230-reform-internet-speech-moderation-platforms"&gt;called the law an effective deterrent&lt;/a&gt; to sex trafficking earlier this year, even if it wasn’t frequently applied. But &lt;a href="https://hackinghustling.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/HackingHustling-Erased.pdf"&gt;a 2020 survey indicated&lt;/a&gt; that it caused platforms to preemptively crack down on consensual sex workers as well, making their jobs more dangerous and difficult — while the GAO’s report indicates little direct evidence that it’s helped prosecutors tackle trafficking cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Sims is getting an in-game music festival with Simlish songs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Awxg0kktexmk8Nfmxiaqv0TucBw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69499538/TS4_SIMS_SESSION_SCREENS_01_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="72SyDn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sims &lt;/em&gt;is the latest game to feature a virtual concert, but this one comes with a twist: some of the songs will be performed in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126705/the-sims-simlish-language-history-20th-anniversary-game"&gt;the fictional Simlish language&lt;/a&gt;. Today EA announced “Sims Sessions,” described as an in-game music festival that will take place inside &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; from June 29th to July 7th. It’ll be headlined by pop star Bebe Rexha, who will sing her single “Sabotage” in Simlish. Glass Animals and Joy Oladokun will serve as the opening acts, though it sounds like they will be performing in boring old English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pxbjzX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A history of Simlish, the language that defined The Sims","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126705/the-sims-simlish-language-history-20th-anniversary-game"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qvgNQK"&gt;In addition to listening to music, players will also be able to explore the festival space, create new outfits, and buy “exclusive digital merchandise” from all of the performers. Meanwhile, Rexha will also be partnering with popular TikTok users for a Simlish karaoke session. She joins a growing list of pop stars to perform in Simlish, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyW6AJ-yIk"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9871786/carly-rae-jepsen-run-away-with-me-simlish"&gt;Carly Rae Jepsen&lt;/a&gt;, and, more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/6/10/22528386/japanese-breakfast-the-sims-4-cottage-living-be-sweet-simlish"&gt;Japanese Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V46tiy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; is just the latest game to feature a virtual music performance, a trend that accelerated after the pandemic brought real-world concerts to a halt. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott took over the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557275/lil-nas-x-roblox-virtual-performance-announced-holiday-old-town-road"&gt;Lil Nas X took to &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and for some reason &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;Post Malone sang alongside a bunch of pokémon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
