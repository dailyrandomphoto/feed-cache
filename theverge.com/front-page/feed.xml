    <title>Google seemingly reveals Pixel Buds A in marketing email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vx1ENvvEjC0bBWBN8dp7lDYS51Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086220/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CUGdoW"&gt;As we approach Google I/O 2021, the rumor mill has started pointing to new hardware, including a Pixel 5A and Pixel Buds A, a lower-cost set of true wireless earbuds that would slot in below the company’s main pair. Google seems to have gotten ahead of itself, however, as, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/google-email-inadvertently-leaks-green-pixel-buds-a/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new email contains an image of olive green Pixel Buds that aren’t part of the current lineup. The interior of the case is also color-matched to the buds, which isn’t the case with the second-gen Pixel Buds. Another clue that these are new is that the inside-facing part of the earbuds is also the same green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIJubi"&gt;So with those things considered, we’re likely seeing the upcoming Pixel Buds A in this image. They look practically identical to the regular Pixel Buds, though the second LED inside the charging case is either gone or just not visible in this shot. There’s always the chance that someone went off and messed with the color tint here so it better matches the Pixel 5, but that’d be a little unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__V-r-jemnA7PQf1AEoKlZbHuis=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425253/067497D5_C6AF_4CCF_89AF_33FDF8D18F5E.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/google-email-inadvertently-leaks-green-pixel-buds-a/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p1EBPS"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/23/new-google-pixel-buds-incoming-fcc/"&gt;recent filing at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; is likely for these earbuds. We’ll have to wait for Google’s eventual announcement to see which features have been cut if the company indeed plans to sell these at a notably lower price than the standard Pixel Buds. With those going for $179, maybe Google will aim to hit a $99 or $129 price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIjFpX"&gt;Google’s second-gen Pixel Buds had some connection stability issues when they first shipped, which the company tried to address over the course of several firmware updates. But some customers continue to encounter issues like dropouts and other bugs, so hopefully Google will say a thing or two about connection strength when it does get around to announcing these Pixel Buds A.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gazelle brings back its phone trade-in program two months after discontinuing it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wTxK49NyoGux2ayro6iaVNjl9U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086084/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hj8AnD"&gt;Trade-in provider Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;exited the online trade-in business&lt;/a&gt; back in February, and now the company says it’s changing its mind. Gazelle is back to accepting online trade-ins of iPhones, Samsung phones, Google Pixel devices, and iPads and other tablets on its website, the company confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The program resumed accepting new offers on April 5th, a Gazelle representative clarified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDePCQ"&gt;“Earlier this year, we announced that we will no longer be offering our trade-in option on Gazelle. After careful consideration, including feedback from customers like you, we have decided to keep Gazelle Trade-In going. Today, we are happy to say, ‘We’re back, baby!’” reads an email Gazelle sent to prospective customers and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Gazelle Trade-In is a pioneer of the electronics trade-in space and we are happy to continue building on our legacy by offering a simple process and immediate payouts for those unwanted devices.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk0Fcj"&gt;Gazelle emerged as one of the leading trade-in providers of the smartphone era. But its business model didn’t fare as well when the US mobile phone business underwent major shifts away from two-year contracts and outright device purchases and toward phone leasing and carrier and device maker trade-in programs like Apple’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v5QVq"&gt;Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; back in December of last year it would end its online phone trade-in program on February 1st, 2021, though the company said at the time it would continue to operate its in-person trade-in kiosks through parent company ecoATM. Gazelle did confirm in the email sent to customers that it will not be bringing back its rewards program. “We will continue to evaluate the market conditions and will inform you if this changes,” the email reads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new gaming phone looks like a Transformer sandwich</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCm38ReLQr5oa9S-kYJneqenSng=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085854/thescarylenovophone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a big fan of the design of this rumored Lenovo gaming phone, to be honest. Kind of looks like a Transformer in disguise. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Weibo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f3E0yE"&gt;Lenovo’s next gaming phone has leaked, with a design that looks like a Michael Bay Transformer and a gaming PC merged together. It’s unlike anything I have ever seen on a phone before. I’m not sure if I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkmBqj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4622920313473303"&gt;Pictures of what appears to be the phone&lt;/a&gt; were shown on the social media service Weibo recently, and I am speechless. Specifically, the dual-camera setup is located at the dead center of the phone, and there’s a built-in active cooling fan. It reminds me a lot of a Transformer, as you can see from the photo below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EQEFJx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10432513"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3M4Ub"&gt;Now, Lenovo is not the first company to stick a cooling fan in a gaming smartphone. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522625/nubia-red-magic-3-gaming-phone-release-date-cooling-price-specs-features"&gt;Nubia’s Red Magic 3&lt;/a&gt; had a cooling fan placed inside of the device. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglobal.blackshark.com%2Fproducts%2Ffuncooler-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22370308%2Flenovo-phone-2-pro-release-date-price-design-leaked" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Black Shark FunCooler Pro&lt;/a&gt; is an external cooling fan designed for people who game on their phones. Not to mention Asus’ &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/power-protection-gadgets/docks-dongles-and-cables/aeroactive-cooler-5-model/"&gt;AeroActive Cooler 5&lt;/a&gt;, an external fan designed to cool down its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; gaming phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdKVLA"&gt;But the biggest concern I have for the recent images of the rumored Lenovo phone (which is rumored to be called the Legion Phone 2 Pro) is that gaming phones may continue to include more ridiculous designs. Lenovo’s first gaming phone, which launched last year, already had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333138/lenovo-legion-duel-pro-gaming-phone-pop-up-selfie-cam-side-landscape"&gt;an absurd design by placing a pop-up camera on the side of the phone&lt;/a&gt;. But new model looks to escalate things even further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjCF6J"&gt;According to the leaks, Lenovo’s Legion Phone 2 Pro is rumored to launch on April 8th in China first, but it's unclear if the phone will release anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay’s app will soon be able to scan Pokémon cards to sell them more easily</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcJxFl5d1MbZRrS0JIF8IOznhD8=/9x0:1991x1321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085848/Image_Listing_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;eBay Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0NuaD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebay-cuts-listing-time-in-half-for-trading-card-sellers-with-new-feature-coming-april-2021-301254869.html"&gt;eBay has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new addition coming to its mobile app: soon, you’ll be able to scan trading cards from popular games like Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh! to more easily sell them on the online auction site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4hOQF"&gt;The new card scanning feature is set to arrive at the end of April, but it’ll only support Magic: The Gathering when it launches. Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! are planned to be added in May, with sports cards and “other collectible card games” on the docket for later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NYeBd"&gt;Using the new scanning option, sellers will be able to just scan a card, at which point eBay will use the card’s details to help automatically build the listing. Sellers will still have to add additional information, like photos of the actual card, its condition, the price they wish to sell it for, and any other details. But the automatic identification process should make it easier for sellers to create their listings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLjrxB"&gt;In addition to the new scanning feature, eBay is adding a few other improvements to the trading card purchasing process for both sellers and buyers. Sellers will no longer have to offer the option to return purchases in order to qualify for eBay’s Top Rated seller program. And the company is working on “reviewing its buyer protection policy for trading cards” to better both sellers and buyers in the current market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9uU14"&gt;Trading cards — specifically, Pokémon cards — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/10/22276531/pokemon-card-game-company-reprinting-high-demand"&gt;are in high demand these days&lt;/a&gt;. And the number of people looking to cash in is skyrocketing — to the point where appraisal company Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) has been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22360269/pokemon-card-psa-rating-services-halted"&gt;forced to suspend submissions&lt;/a&gt; while it &lt;a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/10367/psa-customer-update-april-2021"&gt;works through its backlog&lt;/a&gt;. And given that popularity, it’s not a surprise that eBay is looking to make it easier for sellers to use the platform to list their cards. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet shareholder pushes Google for better whistleblower protections  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOQwpOMovPBsVYRIFcDi5Tyzww8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085546/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj0c1h"&gt;Alphabet shareholder Trillium Asset Management is pushing Google to adopt better whistleblower protections in light of the firing of prominent AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru. The $3.5 billion sustainable investment firm has &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57693891579fb3ab7149f04b/t/6041152193eaa01f724c5ffb/1614877985824/Alphabet+Whistleblower+Resolution+2021.pdf"&gt;filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; asking the board of directors for a third-party review of current policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO1SWF"&gt;“Reporting suggests that many Google employees who have resigned or been fired … publicly report retaliation after voicing human rights implications of company practices, including systemic workplace racism and sexism,” the resolution reads. “These red flags suggest the potential for culture, ethics, and/or human rights problems internally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtJf8x"&gt;Trillium owns 63,078 Alphabet shares— a stake currently worth roughly $140 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFSbMw"&gt;Gebru was fired late last year while working on a paper about the dangers of large language models. Two months later, her co-lead Margaret Mitchell was also terminated after using a script to search her emails for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. Google claims she violated its security policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IB8IhG"&gt;Open MIC, a nonprofit that works with shareholders to advocate for greater corporate accountability and is helping to organize the proposal, says Mitchell’s firing may have been retaliatory. “The justification they use is ‘this person violated our data security work,’” says associate director Hannah Lucal. “It’s important to lift that up because they use trade secrets and data policy as an excuse for retaliating against worker organizers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3Kw3x"&gt;The sentiment is echoed by the Alphabet Workers Union, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;which launched in January&lt;/a&gt; in part to protect employees and contractors from retaliation. “We want to know that if a project goes off the rails our coworkers who know about it can tell us,” says Andrew Gainer-Dewar, a Google software engineer and union member. “That’s why the safety of whistleblowing is so important. And that’s what we’re trying to build with the union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqMENp"&gt;The new proposal is based on the still-radical idea that whistleblowers are good for business. “Whistleblowers protect investors, not management,” says Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at Trillium. “You naturally expect management not to be supportive of whistleblower protections because it’s not in their narrow personal interest. Whistleblowers are always an embarrassment to management and always a way for investors to protect the long term value of the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYHPjW"&gt;While Trillium and Open MIC are hoping to get more Google shareholders on board with the proposal, their larger goal is making company leaders aware of the problem. “The threshold for success is open to discussion,” says Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC. “Directors of a company are aware of every issue on the ballot. If you get 20 percent of the vote the company is aware of the issues and oftentimes the biggest shareholders will call them up and talk to them about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBGeK0"&gt;Trillium and Open MIC organized a similar proposal in 2020 but were shot down. At the time, the board said it believed Google’s current policies were adequate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E60IzU"&gt;“Our argument this year is basically the proof is in the pudding,” says Kron. “A year ago you said everything was hunky dory and in the meantime we‘ve seen what happened with Dr. Gebru and ongoing protests by Google employees, which suggests that things aren’t working well, that there are these red flags that indicate something needs to change.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google AI manager resigns following controversial firings of two top researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzzIrTKTfgQ0QegbEs-_fJQrnsk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085524/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oG79Di"&gt;A Google researcher manager has resigned following the controversial firings of two female leaders in his organization. Samy Bengio, who oversaw the ethical AI team prior to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289264/google-restructuring-ethical-ai-team-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;a reorganization in February&lt;/a&gt;, is leaving to pursue other opportunities, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/google-ai-research-manager-samy-bengio-resigns-in-email-to-staff?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His last day will be April 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2ptkY"&gt;Bengio was a strong advocate of star AI ethics researchers Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell, who previously co-led the ethical AI team. Gebru was fired in December while working on a paper about the dangers of large language models. Mitchell was terminated in February after using a script to search her emails for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhCAte"&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&amp;amp;id=100002932057665&amp;amp;comment_id=3470470943060607&amp;amp;notif_t=mentions_comment&amp;amp;notif_id=1607192244022022&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;In a statement on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the firing, Bengio said he was “stunned” by what happened to Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POUJ5e"&gt;The terminations sparked outrage across the tech industry, leading multiple researchers to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/tech/google-ai-ethics-reputation/index.html"&gt;decline funding&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HadasKressGazit/status/1370432606882381829"&gt;other opportunities&lt;/a&gt; from Google. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266513/google-engineers-quit-timnit-gebru-ethical-ai-april-christina-curley-firing"&gt;Two Google engineers also quit the company in protest&lt;/a&gt;, citing Gebru’s firing as a primary reason for their resignations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsAAvX"&gt;After Gebru’s departure, Google reorganized its research department, slotting the ethical AI team under Marian Croak, a leader in the engineering department. The move cut Bengio’s responsibilities, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vRLRG"&gt;In his farewell letter to staff, Bengio reportedly said that while he was looking forward to his next challenge, leaving Google Brain was difficult. “I learned so much with all of you, in terms of machine learning research of course, but also on how difficult yet important it is to organize a large team of researchers so as to promote long term ambitious research, exploration, rigor, diversity and inclusion,” he wrote. He did not mention the firings of Gebru or Mitchell. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UfZxZ"&gt;NASA’s mini Ingenuity helicopter survived its first night all alone on the surface of Mars after getting dropped off by Perseverance on Saturday. Weathering frigid Martian temperatures, the newly deployed rotorcraft passed an important test of independence, giving engineers confidence to proceed with a series of warming-up exercises in preparation for its first flight this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJayun"&gt;“That was one of the huge, huge achievements that we’ve been looking forward to, and now we can move on to the rest of the mission,” Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity deputy operations lead, said on Monday on a NASA live stream. “And now we’re on our own. We’re a separate spacecraft on Mars on our own energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWg5Cy"&gt;The four-pound, solar-powered craft arrived on Mars attached to the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover on February 18th. The rover dropped Ingenuity’s protective covering last month to begin a meticulous, week-long deployment process that concluded last weekend, with Ingenuity’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;four landing legs firmly planted&lt;/a&gt; on the Martian surface for the first time. Soon after, Ingenuity’s 13-megapixel camera snapped its first image of the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-S0iyg3gQmHlwN3xnEPufsosUak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424771/1e_PIA24437.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5qvsnk"&gt;Perseverance backed away, kicking off the helicopter’s 31-day clock to carry out five flight tests and become the first craft to achieve powered flight on another world. Its first flight is currently slated for Sunday, April 11th, with confirmation on whether the attempt was successful arriving through the Mars-to-Earth data pipeline the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nARUe5"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory confirmed Ingenuity survived Mars’ freezing-cold nighttime temperatures of around -130 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday morning, after the copter sent signals back to Mars Base Station, a communications hub aboard Perseverance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4qqlL"&gt;For its first flight test this weekend, Ingenuity will rise nearly 10 feet from the surface and hover in place for roughly 30 seconds. It’ll pivot while hovering to demonstrate fluid movement, then begin a gradual descent for a landing. Engineers expect to receive images of Ingenuity’s hover on the morning of April 12th, along with troves of data on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAgLAW"&gt;Perseverance beamed back images of Ingenuity shortly after dropping it off on its “helipad,” a small space on one side of its running track-shaped flight zone. Subsequent tests within Ingenuity’s 30-day test window include flying as high as 16 feet and zipping forward within the flight zone. The copter won’t carry out any science missions during its stay on Mars; engineers have emphasized this is just a flight demonstration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="an5eVy"&gt;Ingenuity’s twin-rotor system, spanning four feet, will spin in opposite rotations as quickly as 2,400 rpm to achieve lift in Mars’ ultrathin atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4xDRe"&gt;Despite the copter’s tiny and lightweight design, it needs to be fully power-independent now that it has detached from Perseverance’s power supply. To do this, the craft has a solar panel above its propellers that powers six lithium-ion batteries in its tissue box-sized body, which also houses a computer roughly 100 times more powerful than Perseverance’s, and small heaters to keep itself warm through frigid Martian nights.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The creator of Threes is back with a game about slaying giant beasts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OxKpPoswTeXmzaLh8gQ9DPpgngY=/296x0:2237x1294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085445/Screen_Shot_2021_04_06_at_2.54.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PCtX4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt; designer Asher Vollmer is launching a new studio, Vodeo Games, and announced the company’s first game, a turn-based adventure called &lt;a href="https://vodeo.games/bb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beast Breaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoList"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beast Breake&lt;/em&gt;r stars Skipper, a tiny mouse warrior fighting mosaic monsters. The game relies on tactical choices via pinball-like mechanics; players can also craft equipment to assist them on their journey. It’s heading to Nintendo Switch and PC this summer. Vodeo released a brief trailer alongside the news today that shows off the game’s quick gameplay and colorful art style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvj6jK"&gt;On its website, Vodeo says it plans to release small, intimate games “full of complex, interlocking systems that can take years to fully master,” once every year. The studio is &lt;a href="https://vodeo.games/game2"&gt;already teasing a second one&lt;/a&gt; as part of its plan to work on multiple projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbqRB1"&gt;Since releasing&lt;em&gt; Threes&lt;/em&gt;, Vollmer has continued to work on other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8294765/indie-game-one-hit-wonder-minecraft-threes"&gt;experimental projects&lt;/a&gt;, including low-fi peasant-simulator &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/30/8522963/royals-game-threes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Royals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Apple Arcade fantasy title &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954926/apple-arcade-guildlings-game-launch-threes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guildlings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this feature on how India’s digital revolution started with missed calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-ECONOMY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ygzgFnXJjndxRvgNs35f9_Mc5E=/0x3:8367x5581/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085277/1231334394.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KREkbs"&gt;Leaving a missed call on someone’s phone usually signals that you should call them back — but at one point in India, it was communication in its own right. &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;A new feature by Atul Bhattarai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; examines the Indian culture that grew up around missed calls — and the startups that took advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeXSb9"&gt;In basic terms, a “missed call” means dialing a person but hanging up before they can answer. Hanging up without talking let users send a basic message (“I called”) without getting charged for minutes or SMS messages — like paging someone without a pager. Bhattarai focuses on ZipDial, a company that turned missed calls into a robust advertising business and a way to experience some of the features of online life without paying for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6V18Uz"&gt;As Bhattarai writes, using missed calls to communicate came about because of the high cost of cellphone data and limited access to high-speed internet. Calling long enough to connect to someone else’s phone and then hanging up or not picking up on the other end avoided being charged for the call. These missed calls could mean a variety of things, like letting a friend know you’re on your way or a loved one know that you miss them. “The fact that the missed call demanded only basic numeric literacy made them accessible to the third of India’s population that was illiterate,” Bhattarai explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu1ehq"&gt;ZipDial combined the missed call trend and preexisting SMS services into a kind of a one-stop shop for cellphone owners who wanted basic internet functionality. ZipDial would partner with a brand and set up a hotline that people could call for services like sports scores or celebrity tweets. All it took was “signing up” with a missed call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jINvf7"&gt;Bhattarai also highlights a proto-Spotify algorithmic playlist service called Kan Khajura, which delivered new music in 15-minute calls. “Kan Khajura’s central appeal was that it could be accessed anywhere and anytime, unlike the radio and TV,” Bhattarai writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkuUeq"&gt;Those businesses became unsustainable as mobile data became cheaper, and ZipDial ceased operations in 2016. But Bhattarai argues the services helped bridge the offline-online gap in a period before internet service providers and physical infrastructure caught up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWi18q"&gt;You can read the full feature on &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/"&gt;ZipDial’s missed call empire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Rest of World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea is working with Sonos on a hidden speaker built into art you hang on the wall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGae2NmCSMaP9XKPgFdN9f7Vzo4=/111x0:1755x1096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085093/Screen_Shot_2021_04_06_at_2.32.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyVQSv"&gt;Ikea and Sonos are starting to tease the next products that the two companies have collaborated on. The furniture giant today &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/speakers/news/sonos/156425-sonos-confirms-new-ikea-symfonisk-speaker-is-coming"&gt;posted an Instagram story&lt;/a&gt; that directly mentions the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;“Symfonisk” line&lt;/a&gt; and flashes the Sonos logo at the end, so there’s little doubt that new hardware is coming soon. Two fresh filings have also just appeared at the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfg6so"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can exclusively share details on what’s coming. The first new product, &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-920-00632"&gt;covered in this filing&lt;/a&gt;, is a revamped version of the Symfonisk table lamp. It’s expected to be sold for around the same price ($179) as the original product, which basically stuffed the sound quality of a Sonos Play:1 into the body of a lamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KVJwc"&gt;But from what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; understands, the $99 Symfonisk bookshelf speaker — the most affordable gateway into the Sonos platform — is not due for any major updates. Instead, the second product that Ikea and Sonos will announce in 2021 is completely new: a piece of wall art with an integrated speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bA8mj97J1mfqbKBAaGNxjMWwC44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18332906/cwelch_190724_3559_2256.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea and Sonos are also preparing an updated table lamp speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7EOksw"&gt;Companies like Soundwall have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/21/14686272/soundwall-nova-launch-speaker-art"&gt;produced artwork speakers before&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s safe to assume that Ikea and Sonos are targeting a price point that’s dramatically lower than those expensive products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfwlz6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has seen an early image of this product, codenamed “Titan,” but details about how it functions couldn’t yet be learned. Specifically, it’s unclear whether the entire artwork print is the product or if the speaker unit can be transferred between different exterior art housings. One of the two new FCC filings from Ikea and Sonos is for &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-920-00632"&gt;a “wireless module.”&lt;/a&gt; At a distance, it could look like any of Ikea’s wall prints, only with much more tech on the other side (and a power cord running down from the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="dPk7BM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="au8RD2"&gt;All of the Symfonisk products so far have been designed with a dual purpose in mind. The lamp combines a speaker and light source; the bookshelf speaker can literally be used as a shelf when mounted to a wall. And they’re also meant to blend into home decor. From that angle, combining artwork and a music speaker seems like a natural progression for the Symfonisk series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5A99o"&gt;I’ve heard from a fair number of Sonos customers who use the Symfonisk bookshelf speakers as rear surrounds for Sonos’ Arc and Beam soundbars. They work very well for that purpose, but a stereo pair of wall art speakers could make for an even sleeker home theater setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2V8Em"&gt;Ikea and Sonos have not yet revealed exactly when they plan to announce their latest collaborative efforts. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Sonos for comment. In the immediate future, Sonos is gearing up for the launch of its new Sonos Roam, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313451/sonos-roam-leak-features-specs-price-release-date"&gt;a product first leaked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which starts shipping on April 20th. You can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;full review of that excellent portable speaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
