    <title>Twitter labels some Indian politicians’ tweets about COVID-19 as manipulated media</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;India’s government has criticized Twitter for applying its “manipulated media” label to some Indian politicians’ tweets about COVID-19 efforts, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Indian news &lt;a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.opindia.com/2021/05/govt-slams-twitter-for-labeling-congress-toolkit-tweets-manipulated-media-meity/"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday. The government has asked Twitter to remove the tags out of “fairness and equity,” saying the application of the labels affects the platform’s image as “neutral and unbiased.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68PiW7"&gt;The government sent the notice to Twitter two days after it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1395714092837457931?s=20"&gt;applied the “manipulated media” label&lt;/a&gt; to a tweet by Sambit Patra, of India’s ruling BJP party. Patra said in the tweet, which appears to have been deleted (it’s not clear whether Twitter removed it or if Patra deleted it himself), that opposition party Congress had used a “toolkit” in attempts to subvert the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKkB36"&gt;The BJP party accuses the Congress party of creating the toolkit to damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-the-congress-toolkit-controversy-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/82761578.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, but the Congress party claims the version of the toolkit the BJP is spreading is a faked version of a research note about an unrelated project.  &lt;a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/"&gt;Indian fact-checking organization &lt;em&gt;Alt News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found images of the so-called “COVID toolkit” that Patra and others had tweeted contained some falsified information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzI35U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257"&gt;According to Indian news site &lt;em&gt;The News Minute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Patra’s tweet read: “Friends look at the #CongressToolKit in extending help to the needy during the Pandemic! More of a PR exercise with the help of Friendly Journalists &amp;amp; Influencers than a soulful endeavour. Read for yourselves the agenda of the Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiN2WA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter introduced its manipulated media policy last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AmNwcM"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Friday. The platform &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-approach-to-synthetic-and-manipulated-media.html"&gt;introduced its manipulated media policy&lt;/a&gt; last February, which applies to media that is “significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated.” Video clips or images that have been altered to change their meaning or context could get a label under the rules, and false content presented as true or content found to be “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm” could be removed entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8CLes"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/trump-tweet-label-video/"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; by former US President Donald Trump, who has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, received the manipulated media label last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RDUdx"&gt;Twitter has grappled with local legal requirements in India, particularly with regard to content about the coronavirus pandemic. Late last month, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;removed more than 50 tweets critical&lt;/a&gt; of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic there, at the government’s request. The censored accounts included a sitting member of Parliament and other prominent figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76ZZ3L"&gt;And during protests by farmers in India in February, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/india-twitter.html"&gt;Twitter permanently blocked&lt;/a&gt; more than 500 accounts and removed others from being visible within the country. At the time, the Indian government issued a notice of noncompliance to Twitter, which could have meant jail time for Twitter’s employees in India if the company had refused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGyO25"&gt;According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;India reported&lt;/a&gt; 259,551 new cases of COVID-19 and 4,209 new deaths on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Amazon union case has come down to a mailbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-POLITICS-LABOR-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4DHL2B5fEm9giUqVClDdVbzeMb0=/0x0:5154x3436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324220/1232001976.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vW8zMc"&gt;For months during the union drive, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, felt like they were being watched. There were cameras around BHM1, the 855,000-square-foot warehouse where workers sorted, scanned, and packed boxes. A uniformed police officer patrolled the parking lot all hours of the day and night. Managers came up to peoples’ workstations to ask how they felt about the organizing campaign. So when Amazon had a new USPS mailbox installed — ostensibly to increase voter turnout — many felt they couldn’t trust it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRvtR3"&gt;“Amazon said only the post office had access to it, but that’s not how it felt,” said Serena Wallace, an employee BHM1 who testified on behalf of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). “I avoided the mailbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y9MFzN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon is trying to paint RWDSU as living in fantasy land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9dvBwT"&gt;Wallace’s comments came during a National Labor Relations Board hearing, where the union is contesting the results of the election it lost in early April. Like most court proceedings, it is both theatrical and crushingly boring. RWDSU is trying to convince the labor board to throw out the results of the vote by proving Amazon violated US labor law. Amazon is trying to paint RWDSU as living in fantasy land, refusing to admit that workers simply do not want a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZFcI"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Amazon spokesperson said: “Despite heavy campaigning from union officials, policymakers, and even some media outlets, our employees overwhelmingly rejected the union’s representation. Rather than accepting that choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda. We look forward to continuing to present the facts of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNovWS"&gt;During the first week of the hearing, the union brought up workers to testify about &lt;a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/rwdsu/pages/764/attachments/original/1618837432/Union's_Objections_to_the_Election__10-RC-269250.pdf?1618837432"&gt;each of its 23 objections&lt;/a&gt;. One of these workers was Hope Pendleton — an employee at BHM1. Pendleton said she attended a captive audience meeting in February where she was told that her benefits and health insurance could be taken away if the union drive was successful. The anti-union messaging was relentless, Pendleton explained. “It was a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ct3ql"&gt;Employees said Amazon texted them multiple times a day with anti-union messages. “Don’t let outsiders divide our winning team,” read one, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1357797923598262280/photo/2"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The union may accept fewer benefits for you in return for taking dues directly out of your check and sending them directly to the union.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrl1bm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What have you ever done for me?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KsTwsj"&gt;Kristine Bell, another worker at BHM1, said she attended a meeting where Amazon managers handed out car tags with anti-union messages like “leave RWDSU in the rear view” and “Vote no.” When a manager asked Bell how she felt about the union, she said she felt good. “But it’ll change the way we communicate and what I can do for you,” the manager allegedly responded. “What have you ever done for me?” Bell asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we3yxg"&gt;Workers testified that they were told that the union would take away their voice and that they wouldn’t be able to speak to managers if they had concerns in the workplace. (This is false; unionized workers can of course still raise concerns to managers.) Amazon’s broader message was clear: the union would come in between the company and its employees — and leave workers worse off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlDaAI"&gt;The barrage of communications made some workers feel pressured and monitored. Voting was supposed to be anonymous — but the constant surveillance made some doubt that was possible. If they supported the union, would Amazon know? Could they lose their jobs in retaliation? The atmosphere grew more tense as the vote drew near. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BUc2s4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If RWDSU can demonstrate that employees &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; the company held sway over the vote, it could be enough to overturn the results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jSVgOM"&gt;The environment workers describe here is critical for the proceedings. The union doesn’t need to prove that Amazon had access to how people voted or manipulated the results. If RWDSU can demonstrate that employees &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; the company held sway over the vote, it could be enough to overturn the results, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/amazon-had-key-to-usps-mailbox-used-for-union-vote-witness-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJeXkQ"&gt;That’s why so much of the case hinges on the mailbox. Employees who testified during the hearing say they were suspicious about its providence — particularly when Amazon erected a tent around it with signs that read “Speak for yourself!” and “Mail your ballot here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YdkLV"&gt;Witness testimony also alleged that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/amazon-had-key-to-usps-mailbox-used-for-union-vote-witness-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Amazon security guards had access to the mailbox&lt;/a&gt; and were seen opening it on at least one occasion. RWDSU even presented emails showing that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/amazon-exec-dave-clark-pushed-for-mailbox-in-alabama-union-election.html"&gt;Amazon executive Dave Clark supported the mailbox installation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJmkV"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said the company only had access to incoming mail addressed to the building. “As we’ve said from the start, this mailbox was secure and Amazon had no access to outgoing mail. Similar to any other mailbox that serves businesses, we had access only to the incoming mailbox where we received mail addressed to the building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQk5jC"&gt;During cross-examination, Amazon’s lawyers tried to get workers to say they hadn’t been forced to use the mailbox, regardless of what it looked like. Here’s an exchange between an attorney for the online retail giant and Darryl Johnson, a BHM1 employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bj39n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; You understood that you could mail your ballot at any mailbox in the Birmingham area, and to the extent that anyone wanted to use that mailbox, that was their choice, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtEbtG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson: &lt;/strong&gt;You could say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dut6CG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon never required employees to use that BHM1 mailbox to mail their ballot, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rItxA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson: &lt;/strong&gt;You mean&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;did they tell employees to use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SG4Qo0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; No, did they require it? Did they command it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08IUuN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson:&lt;/strong&gt; You could say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkOsoW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; The mailbox was a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LgrUOR"&gt;Sounds like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7falf1"&gt;“Even though the NLRB definitively denied Amazon’s request for a dropbox on the warehouse property, Amazon felt it was above the law and worked with the postal service anyway to install one,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum &lt;a href="https://www.rwdsu.info/amazon_illegally_interfered_in_union_vote_rwdsu_to_file_objections_and_related_ulp_charges_to_hold_amazon_accountable_for_their_actions"&gt;in a previously published statement&lt;/a&gt;. “They did this because it provided a clear ability to intimidate workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qaYp8"&gt;Amazon’s lawyers have suggested that the mailbox was just an option; no workers were required to use it. But the pressure-cooker atmosphere that workers described during the hearing suggests otherwise. Whether that will be enough to convince the labor board to throw out the results of the election is anyone’s guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAk2Tt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZUSKR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Apple TV 4K lets you play any TV audio through a HomePod</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnB1aCr1PINh7qb269C4LjovO0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324126/jbareham_180202_2266_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoIl6l"&gt;Apple might have discontinued the original, full-size HomePod smart speaker, but the company is continuing to add new functionality to it. The latest one relies on you also buying the new, second-generation Apple TV 4K, however. If you own both products, there’s now built-in support for HDMI ARC and eARC, which lets the HomePod play audio from other devices plugged into your TV — not just an Apple TV streaming box. Gaming consoles should work; same goes for Blu-ray players or even another streaming gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv22Xu"&gt;The feature can be &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/play-audio-from-tv-inputs-homepod-apple-tv/"&gt;enabled in the “video and audio” area&lt;/a&gt; of the Apple TV settings menu. There you’ll see a field labeled “Audio Return Channel (beta),” where you can tell the Apple TV to route all television audio through HomePod speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNZn0V"&gt;I haven’t tested this yet, so I can’t speak to any latency issues that could negate its appeal for gaming, but it’s nice to see the HomePod gaining new tricks even after Apple has officially brought an end to sales of the product. (You can still find them at retailers including Apple itself.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fWzyc"&gt;This continued evolution of home theater features is also a hint that Apple could have more speakers in the pipeline. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported last month that the company is in the early stages of development on a product that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379470/apple-tv-homepod-speaker-camera-video-call-soundbar-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;combines an Apple TV, speaker, and camera&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the $99 HomePod Mini stands as the lone smart speaker that Apple is actively marketing. Unfortunately, that device does not support the new audio return channel feature described above. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fisker is building an electric popemobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bqb3rmpmwB9AQRpxOmgKd7TjfO4=/46x0:2686x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69323983/PF_rendering_p4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fisker Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yRe00V"&gt;EV startup Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-Set-to-Make-First-All-electric-Papal-Transport/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it will make the first all-electric popemobile, using a modified version of its forthcoming Ocean SUV. Automotive designer Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker (his wife and Fisker Inc. co-founder) presented Pope Francis with images of the proposed design during a meeting at the Vatican on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouqWcJ"&gt;Those images show a white Ocean SUV with a glass cupola on top that would let the pope greet the public. The company says it will deliver the vehicle sometime next year. (The regular version of the Ocean SUV is supposed to launch near the end of 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waGMmw"&gt;Traditionally, the official popemobiles are made by Mercedes-Benz and have to be properly armored and outfitted with bulletproof glass. It’s not clear exactly how the Vatican would use Fisker Inc.’s electric SUV; messages to the Holy See’s press office were not immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rVVHVo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Vatican has used electric and hybrid vehicles before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7A0yds"&gt;Still, the pope rides in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popemobiles-pope-francis-rode-in-year-2019-12#the-pope-also-rode-in-a-carbon-neutral-hydrogen-powered-toyota-mirai-around-japan-during-his-visit-in-november-according-to-the-associated-press-8"&gt;all sorts of modified vehicles&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-evolution-of-the-popemobile-5054965"&gt;his travels&lt;/a&gt; and has even used electric zero-emissions cars. The Vatican was gifted &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19508637"&gt;a Renault Kangoo electric van in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, but they were used for less official transport, like tooling around the Papal Palace in summer. Pope Francis was driven around in a hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai in Japan in 2019. Mercedes-Benz has even made hybrid popemobiles for his holiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty5U0I"&gt;However the Vatican decides to use the vehicle, here are some very funny photoshopped images of Pope Francis riding in the modified Ocean provided by Fisker Inc., including one where it looks like the holy father is falling over (perhaps thanks to the electric SUV’s instant torque?): &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uyka3jgtCMi5R5ZxumtSoGZgr0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530877/rear_pic.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SPjcjS3Kl9ewM3GiaYikeQGygs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530876/PF_rendering_p4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K5bk3J"&gt;Henrik Fisker is known for designing Aston Martins, the BMW Z8, and for a brief stint at Tesla during some of its earliest years. He left Tesla to start a company called Fisker Automotive, where he designed a hybrid sports car called Karma. But the company ran into a lot of trouble with the batteries that powered the car, and it ultimately went bankrupt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJi34o"&gt;He founded Fisker Inc. in 2016 and was originally giving the idea of a sports car another go — though all-electric this time around. Fisker has since pivoted his new startup away from that idea and toward far more affordable and supposedly sustainable electric SUVs. The company recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac"&gt;went public in a SPAC merger and raised nearly $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and it has struck a deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; to build an even smaller more affordable “personal electric vehicle.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAbbs0"&gt;“I got inspired reading that Pope Francis is very considerate about the environment and the impact of climate change for future generations,” Fisker said in a statement. “The interior of the Fisker Ocean papal transport will contain a variety of sustainable materials, including carpets made from recycled plastic bottles from the ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citizen CEO offered to personally fund LA arson manhunt — for the wrong person</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘We make this sort of heinous crime impossible to escape from’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yZ0mhG"&gt;As wildfires raged through Southern California last weekend, an app called Citizen offered an unorthodox bounty over livestream and in push alerts to local residents: “hunt down” the alleged arsonist, and we’ll give you $30,000 cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FarmHW"&gt;In the hours that followed, it became clear the app was mistaken. The man pictured had no connection to the fires, and once he was located by law enforcement, he was quickly released for lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtSRlH"&gt;“We are actively working to improve our internal processes to ensure this does not occur again,” the company said in a statement after the release. “This was a mistake we are taking very seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6p6a8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are safety and we make this sort of heinous crime impossible to escape from. That needs to be our mindset.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3MS9ww"&gt;But according to internal communications obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the bounty was personally mandated by Citizen founder and CEO Andrew Frame, who saw it as an opportunity to exercise the app’s policing powers and even offered to fund it with his own money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFsufs"&gt;On Saturday afternoon, before the livestream was broadcast, Frame wrote in a company Slack thread that he would pay a $10,000 reward personally to catch an arsonist still in the area “as a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmj3YQ"&gt;“Let’s find this guy, activate safety network completely,” Frame wrote, according to screenshots of internal Slack messages obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a great transition of Citizen back to active safety. We are not a news company. We are safety and we make this sort of heinous crime impossible to escape from. That needs to be our mindset.” The bounty was later raised to $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abzs21"&gt;First released under the name Vigilante in 2016, Citizen had a rocky rollout. The app was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/01/vigilante-app-removed-apple-store"&gt;pulled from Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; over concerns that it encouraged users to directly take on crime themselves. It was relaunched as Citizen in 2017, providing information transcribed from police and fire dispatch audio. Users also have the option to livestream incidents on the app with guidance to “never approach a crime scene, interfere with an incident, or get in the way of police.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="824J5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Unfortunately, in this instance, on-the-ground tips were used in place of the proper verification with public safety agencies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JOD2y"&gt;The app now provides alerts about crime in more than 30 cities. Citizen’s website boasts that it has sent more than 4 billion alerts and has more than 7 million users. Critics have said the app creates false perceptions about the level of danger to its users and allows users to spread racism in chat replies. More recently, the company raised alarm for &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv88q/citizen-los-angeles-car-private-security"&gt;operating an SUV labeled as “private patrol” in downtown Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, although company representatives insist the vehicle is not engaged in security work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV9iLc"&gt;The Saturday broadcast came &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/5/18/22442024/citizen-app-manhunt-california-fires-arson"&gt;through Citizen’s recently launched OnAir feature&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended as a means to broadcast public safety notices. It’s only the 16th time the feature has been activated, although it’s the first time a cash bounty has been put forward so aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnCrjj"&gt;OnAir has “strict validation protocols to limit the spread of misinformation,” a Citizen spokesperson said in a statement. “In the 15 instances it has been used before, those protocols were followed, unfortunately, in this instance, on-the-ground tips were used in place of the proper verification with public safety agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQxBbu"&gt;“We deeply regret our mistake and are working to improve our internal processes to prevent this from happening again,” the spokesperson continued. They did not address why the service chose to offer a bounty for the suspect in the case specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KaYJ97"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is a huge cohort of engaged users who want to help.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85CjHE"&gt;Frame may have had a personal stake in the fire; property records indicate he is the current owner of a Bel Air mansion within 10 miles of the blaze, with little development in between. In the days following the alert, the fire has grown to 1,158 acres and is still expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vpvCC"&gt;A Citizen spokesperson denied any personal motivation and said Frame’s current residence was not threatened by the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQdN9a"&gt;The Palisades Fire was set by an arsonist in a steep canyon west of Los Angeles just after 10PM on May 14th, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The county ordered evacuations of the surrounding area the following evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8Fxbe"&gt;It is not clear where Citizen first obtained information indicating an arsonist was responsible for the fire. On Saturday, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jay Balgemino told the Pacific Palisades Residents Association that police were searching for an arson suspect. “It appears as though a homeless man living in our hillsides with a criminal past has planned out a wild rampage,” read a post on the association’s Facebook page just after 6PM. “We cannot take the risk of allowing more homeless in a neighborhood with such a fragile environmental landscape.” The association took the post down after an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl6zBS"&gt;However Frame first saw the false identification, the Slack messages show he saw it as an “opportunity” for Citizen to fulfill its “true mission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzYpHh"&gt;“Those people all live there and their homes/families are being threatened,” he wrote in Slack. “There is a huge cohort of engaged users who want to help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdgbIs"&gt;Around 10PM that day, Citizen broadcast a livestream where it displayed a photo of the man and offered the reward for his capture, according to journalist Cerise Castle, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cerisecastle/status/1393804890384728064"&gt;who reported the event on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The hosts did not elaborate on the source of the information but encouraged users to “hunt this guy down.” Twitter users identified one of the hosts as Prince Mapp, Citizen’s head of community and culture, although Citizen declined to confirm the identities of the hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnblBn"&gt;“We know the guy is out there,” said one host, according to Castle. “We need our users to get out there and bring this guy to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D05iTV"&gt;But the man they identified was detained a short time later and released, sheriff’s Lt. Jim Braden told Kate Cagle, a reporter for Spectrum News. Braden said the deputies did not have evidence to charge the man with a crime. He called the actions by Citizen potentially “disastrous” and would only lead to someone getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1w0kTs"&gt;Citizen promoted the livestream on its Twitter account but later deleted the tweet. On Sunday morning, deputies arrested a different man on suspicion of arson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VC61t8"&gt;And while Citizen said it plans to get it right next time, Frame suggested in a Slack message that it won’t be the last time Citizen offers a cash reward. “We need to build this into the product and we will,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter previews Ticketed Spaces, says it’ll take a 20 percent cut of sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQP3BZcUkHLGJeegR5300puR7TY=/0x0:3849x2566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69323358/twittermonetization.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter will launch its Ticketed Spaces in the next couple weeks.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GHLiI9"&gt;Twitter’s getting ready for the launch of its Ticketed Spaces feature, and today, it’s previewing what users can expect when they go to host their first one. US users will be able to apply to host paid live audio rooms starting in the next couple weeks. Anyone who wants to charge has to have 1,000 followers, have hosted three spaces in the past 30 days, and be at least 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izegSw"&gt;The company is partnering with Stripe to handle payments, and it says users will receive 80 percent of revenue after Apple and Google’s in-app purchase fees are taken. So if you sell a $10 ticket, Apple would presumably take a 30 percent cut, leaving you and Twitter to split the remaining $7. Eighty percent would go to you, and 20 percent would go to Twitter. The company says it’ll cover the cost of Stripe’s transaction fees. (Hosts will also need a Stripe account.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKWFmH"&gt;You can see the full product flow below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jifOLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10512000"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn7H9L"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson says initial applications, when they open, will be processed within a few weeks, and the team plans to start with a small test group. Although only US users will be able to host these ticketed spaces for now, anyone around the globe can purchase access. Spaces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;just began&lt;/a&gt; allowing anyone with more than 600 followers to host and added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1395423942400102401"&gt;the ability to schedule&lt;/a&gt; an event, and the company says it’s working on co-hosted spaces as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhXLmy"&gt;This live audio function is among the multiple ways Twitter has announced that it will help its users monetize. It’s planning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, too, which will let people pay for bonus content, like a newsletter subscription and more tweets, and it’s launching a communities feature. The company hasn’t said whether the 80 / 20 split will also apply to Super Follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLvuHQ"&gt;Twitter also might offer a bigger subscription product called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;, which could let people pay for additional features, like the ability to undo tweets. Although Twitter’s product has remained mostly stagnant for years, it’s issued a rapid-fire succession of consumer-facing product announcements this past year, seemingly all in an effort to diversify its revenue and build a more fully rounded place where people can consume a variety of content across text, audio, and video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin Enduro review: marathon runner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The fitness watch that lives up to its name&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kllDRC"&gt;Battery life has been the Achilles’ heel of smartwatches and fitness watches. While solid state storage and processing power have been evolving at a rapid clip, battery life has remained stagnant. This goes quintuple for watches that track your activity using GPS, which is a particularly power-hungry thing to do. And yet, somehow, the Garmin Enduro now exists. If you’re the type of person who likes to run until their kneecaps have been ground into a fine powder, this is the watch for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfZn0F"&gt;The $800 Enduro is a multisport fitness watch. And by multi, I mean pretty much all the sports. Built-in activities include: Run, Ultra Run, Trail Run, Treadmill, Virtual Run, Track Run, Indoor Track Run, Bike, Mountain Bike, Indoor Bike, Pool Swim, Open Water Swim, Triathlon, SwimRun, Hike, Expedition, Climb, Indoor Climb, Bouldering, Ski, Snowboard, Cross Country Ski, Cross Country Skate Ski, Backcountry Ski, Surf, SUP, Kayak, Row, Indoor Row, Navigate, Track Me, Pilates, Yoga, Breathwork, Cardio, Strength, Golf, and others (including downloadable options made by third parties) but honestly I’m tired of typing. Basically, it has all of the same activity modes as Garmin’s current multisport flagship, the Fenix 6 (starting at $550, up to $1,100), but there are some significant tradeoffs, which I’ll get to in a sec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pfhMCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10510917"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cnlwFb"&gt;Let’s start with the body. Physically, the Enduro is a perfect twin of the larger Fenix 6X. (You can see a more in-depth comparison between the two &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2FcompareResult.ep%3FcompareProduct%3D702902%26compareProduct%3D702797&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22446410%2Fgarmin-enduro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Garmin’s site&lt;/a&gt;.) It has a 1.4-inch transflective (sunlight visible) color LCD screen. It’s extremely easy to read, particularly outdoors (at night it lights up with the push of a button). The screen also doubles as a low-key solar panel, giving you extra juice when you wear it outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q518KM"&gt;The body is just over two inches by two inches and 0.6 inches thick. In other words, it’s a bit chunky, and people with smaller wrists probably will not like it. I have weirdly big wrist bones, so I didn’t mind the way it felt, and it didn’t look like I was wearing a tablet on my arm. Despite its size it’s quite light, coming in at 71 grams for the steel version or 61 grams for the more expensive titanium version. That weight is partly due to the new, slightly stretchy nylon strap, which is comfortable and dries quickly. There are a lot of other strap options to choose from, should you so desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZKj2s"&gt;Like the Fenix and most other Garmin watches, the Enduro has five physical buttons which you use for navigating in lieu of a touchscreen. This is the most intuitive of any of the fitness watches I’ve used, and the UI has only gotten better with age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xCwrh_eM59NvoYODZzR-guvHz8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529263/20210518GarminEnduro6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Enduro lacks a touchscreen but has five physical buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvxfhP"&gt;In addition to being a training watch, it has basic smartwatch features, including displaying notifications from your phone. Android users (like me, I tested it with a Pixel 5) can quick reply to messages from the watch (unfortunately Apple has blocked this feature on the iPhone for any device except the Apple Watch, which seems pretty anti-competitive if you ask me). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlAGKp"&gt;From the main screen, pressing the bottom left button (the down button) gets you to a bunch of widgets that provide a lot of data at a glance. It’s just the right amount of information density. If you want more granular info, you can dive into the Garmin Connect app (iOS and Android), which has a lot of detail, but its design is very dated and it can be tricky to find what you’re looking for in it. It’s not bad, but it could benefit from a refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xCriW"&gt;In addition to daily tracking of things like steps, floors climbed, heart rate, sleep quality, and even respiration rate, the Enduro also has a pulse oximeter which uses a special red LED. In my testing, it was roughly as accurate as the finger-based (medical grade) one I bought toward the beginning of lockdown last year. You can choose to have it track your pulse ox 24/7, but that will take a big bite out of your battery life. You can also choose to just track pulse ox as you sleep, which might be good for someone who suffers from sleep apnea. If you don’t have any underlying health concerns, though, I’d just leave it off and check it on demand whenever you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wb1pLk"&gt;The Enduro is primarily a training watch, and it has all of the excellent tools that the Fenix line has, including Body Battery (which surprisingly mapped quite closely to how well rested or depleted I felt), Stress, VO2 Max over time, as well as Training Status. There are some new features debuting on this watch as well. One of the most useful I found was Trail Run VO2 Max. It takes terrain into account, so if you’re running slower because of rocks, it won’t give you an artificially low V02 Max score. Garmin has also upgraded its ClimbPro features, which take ascend and descend into consideration in both your stats and your pace recommendations. The watch can even alert you before you get to a hill (you have to preload a route into the watch) so you can prepare yourself for a climb. There are also new Ultrarunning specific features which I was unable to test because I prefer other ways of injuring myself. It’s worth noting that these new features are also making their way to the Fenix line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Ea76QtOBZgk201lnMNY7MXqXdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529273/20210518GarminEnduro5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Enduro’s soft velcro strap is comfortable and dries quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tU51eTEIHjE3GQyUPEfbQWJRjSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529278/20210518GarminEnduro3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the underside of Enduro’s titanium chassis are the sensors necessary for tracking your vitals, including a pulse oximeter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8xQ9v0"&gt;So, why might you want the Enduro over the Fenix? Capital B Battery life. That is really the one and only reason. The battery lasts more than twice as long as the Fenix, and the Fenix is one of the longest-lasting training watches I’ve tested. If you currently use an Apple Watch, you may weep when you read this, but here are the numbers the company claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JPzPHB"&gt;Smartwatch mode: up to 50 days / 65 days with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x0p5al"&gt;Battery Saver Watch mode: up to 130 days / one year with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="akLdXC"&gt;GPS: up to 70 hours / 80 hours with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qmyILE"&gt;Max Battery GPS mode: up to 200 hours / 300 hours with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1SX1wd"&gt;Expedition GPS Activity: up to 65 days / 95 days with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1laEto"&gt;That is absolutely unparalleled. It’s also conservative in my estimation. I wore this watch for a solid month, constantly using it as a smartwatch (checking notifications, checking my vitals, etc). That included 12 hours and 51 minutes of surfing (GPS tracked), four hours and three minutes of running (GPS tracked), and three hours and 16 minutes of strength training (non-GPS). I did not have to take the watch off to charge it at all. Not one single time. It is easily the longest-lasting training / smartwatch I have ever tested, and by a gigantic margin. Garmin claims that it didn’t do this by stuffing in a larger physical battery but by optimizing the underlying platform. I tried to get more details, but they were understandably tight-lipped about the secret recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZICheo"&gt;So, you may see that and think “well then, obviously this is an easy choice over the Fenix 6, right?” Well, not quite. There are some things the Enduro doesn’t have, and they aren’t insignificant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nS6dqYCeN2-USHlpcgyy2ePgJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529275/Screenshot_20210517_090713_Connect.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garmin’s app is functional but in need of a refresh. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vv8Z6e"&gt;The biggest thing the Enduro lacks is maps. The Fenix 6 has topographic maps of the entire US built right into it, and that’s been incredibly useful to me. It’s actually kept me from taking wrong turns while hiking on a number of occasions. You can still track back with the Enduro, bread-crumb style, but it will appear as a disembodied trail without any context or landmarks to help guide you. This also means the Enduro doesn’t have some specific cycling training and other navigational features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHHCqU"&gt;The other big thing the Enduro is missing is music. The Fenix allows you to store songs on it and play them via Bluetooth earbuds, so you can leave your phone at home. The Enduro doesn’t. If you want tunes to go with your workout, you’re going to need to carry a second device. This brings up a somewhat frustrating point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jul91"&gt;With those things missing, you might assume that it’s because the Enduro has less storage compared to the Fenix. It doesn’t. In fact, it has double the storage of the Fenix at 64GB vs. 32GB. As far as I can tell, the only reason the Enduro doesn’t have maps and music is because Garmin didn’t want to cannibalize sales of the Fenix 6, which is frustrating. If you compare the Enduro to the Fenix 6 Pro Solar edition (which has the same hidden solar-panel display as the Enduro), both watches are a wince-inducing $800. The Fenix is a bit more svelte and has a very slightly smaller screen, but otherwise they’re the same. You just have to choose, do you want maps and all the features they come with, or do you want double the battery life? Garmin could have easily given you both — and perhaps the Fenix 7 or Enduro 2 will have both, or a firmware update could bring maps and music to the Enduro — but for now it’s an either / or between two fantastic features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-ncM3NX5tXQcuzXsJNljwZntzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529280/20210518GarminEnduro8_sq.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Enduro is the watch to get if you never want to worry about charging it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VgxMDZ"&gt;It’s a strange dilemma. Ultimately, I think the Fenix 6 is the better, more complete watch, and so that’s the one I would lean toward recommending. You just have to remember to charge it three times as often. That being said, the Enduro is still an excellent watch, and being able to go on a very long trip and leave the (proprietary) charger at home is a real boon, and if you do any ultra-length activities, then this is absolutely the watch you want. For now, I’ll stick with the Fenix 6 in case I get lost, again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DeepMind reportedly lost a yearslong bid to win more independence from Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. DOJ File Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/srdZZNmS10OisVftWpPK0bw4PcY=/0x2:3500x2335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69323165/1281728508.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63uorQ"&gt;Tensions between Google and its AI brain trust DeepMind have always been fascinating. To put the relationship in crude terms: DeepMind, founded in 2010, is home to some the best AI researchers in the world who output a steady stream of insightful academic papers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495548/deepmind-ai-go-alphago-zero-self-taught"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;front covers&lt;/a&gt;. Google, meanwhile, bought DeepMind in 2014 and bankrolls its &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/27/deepminds-big-losses-and-the-questions-around-running-an-ai-lab/#:~:text=According%20to%20its%20annual%20report,%C2%A3717%20million%20in%202019."&gt;large losses&lt;/a&gt;, and it really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants to squeeze some money out of all those juicy brains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRuu3A"&gt;That’s why a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-unit-deepmind-triedand-failedto-win-ai-autonomy-from-parent-11621592951"&gt;recent story&lt;/a&gt; on the two companies from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is so interesting. In it, Parmy Olson reports that Google has ended yearslong negotiations between the two firms, ultimately rejecting a plea from DeepMind for more independence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MYwYb7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One idea reportedly suggested was for DeepMind to have nonprofit status&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjETsl"&gt;According to Olson, DeepMind told staff the talks were over “late last month.” One suggestion from DeepMind’s founders was apparently for the company to have the same legal structure as a nonprofit, “reasoning that the powerful artificial intelligence they were researching shouldn’t be controlled by a single corporate entity, according to people familiar with those plans.” But Google wasn’t on board with this, telling DeepMind it didn’t make sense considering how much money the company has poured into DeepMind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1bgUl"&gt;This conflict isn’t surprising. Google execs have said repeatedly the company’s future lies in AI, and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deep-confusion-tensions-lingered-within-google-over-deepmind"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/03/01/deepmind-and-google-the-battle-to-control-artificial-intelligence"&gt;news stories&lt;/a&gt; suggest the mothership has been pressuring DeepMind into commercializing its work. This has led to projects from DeepMind using its research to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17327104/android-battery-management-ai-artificial-intelligence-google-io-2018"&gt;improve battery life on Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40"&gt;reduce energy costs in its data centers&lt;/a&gt;, but the financial benefits of these efforts are unclear. Meanwhile, the UK firm’s losses keep rising — hitting a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/deepmind-lost-649-million-and-alphabet-waived-a-1point5-billion-debt-.html#:~:text=Tech-,DeepMind%20A.I.,billion%20debt%20waived%20by%20Alphabet&amp;amp;text=The%20London%2Dheadquartered%20AI%20lab,U.K.'s%20Companies%20House%20registry."&gt;high of £477 million&lt;/a&gt; (around $660 million) in its most recent public filings for 2019. If Google wants its money’s worth, it can’t give DeepMind anything like nonprofit status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3WqJT"&gt;Alongside financial pressures, another bone of contention between the two companies seems to be ethical oversight. A much-trumpeted element in Google’s acquisition of DeepMind was a promise that Google would set up an ethics board to ensure its technology was always deployed fairly. The exact nature and scope of this board, though, including who sits on it, has always been unclear. A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/03/01/deepmind-and-google-the-battle-to-control-artificial-intelligence"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the board even held ownership over any artificial general intelligence created by DeepMind — a term that refers to AI that meets or exceeds human capacity across a broad range of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lue4Cj"&gt;The status of this board is not mentioned in the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report, but Olson notes that DeepMind’s future work will now be overseen by a separate ethics board “staffed mostly by senior Google executives.” Olson noted in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/parmy/status/1395755476546113538"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that this is the Advanced Technology Review Council, or ATRC. This is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-06/the-google-ai-ethics-board-with-actual-power-is-still-around"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; Google’s “highest review board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yB11jK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, May 21st, 11:04AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story has been updated to note that the ethics board mentioned in the &lt;/em&gt;WSJ&lt;em&gt;’s report is the ATRC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose a photo storage service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Photos on the Google Pixel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYXwhBgMRaP0gsWNtPB0Z6ePB8k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67778301/google_photos_vlad_savov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9HfSI"&gt;Last November, Google — which until now has offered unlimited storage for “high quality” (read: compressed) photos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;announced that “unlimited” is being changed&lt;/a&gt; to “up to 15GB on your Google account.” In other words, while photo and video storage currently does not count against your total of 15 free gigs on a Google account, it will as of this coming June 1st — along with your Gmail, Google Drive files, and other stored data. Once you hit that 15GB wall, you will have to buy into the Google One service to increase your storage capacity. (Unless you own a Pixel, in which case you still have no limits on “high quality” photos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTbl7b"&gt;If you’re a Google Photos user who finds all of this a bit irritating, you may be thinking of leaving. But first, it’s a good idea to check out your alternatives. Below are some of the main photo storage services available to you, along with their basic fees, so you can figure out whether you want to switch. (Note: We’ve only included services that are specifically geared toward photos, not more general storage services such as OneDrive or Dropbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chKhYl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXH35MCZPB-qOWTZMXZFKj3STjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504078/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.57.42_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qoZVjQ"&gt;Google provides each of its accounts with 15GB of free storage. However, for the last few years, photos have been treated differently: under its “high quality” plan, Google stored an unlimited number of photos for free as long as you allow them to be compressed to 16 megapixels. (According to Google, photos that size can be printed without issue up to 24 x 16 inches.) Videos were kept to a maximum of 1080p. (Data such as closed captions could be eliminated to save space.) “Original quality” photos — those that were not compressed — were not part of this unlimited plan but were counted as regular files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5YwJy"&gt;However, all of that is changing. As mentioned above, starting on June 1st, 2021, Google will be including photos in its storage calculations. Once you hit that 15GB ceiling, you will have to buy into the &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;Google One service&lt;/a&gt; for additional storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXGQL"&gt;Google One currently starts at 100GB of storage for $1.99 a month ($19.99 a year) and proceeds to 200GB for $2.99 a month ($29.99 a year) or 2TB for $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year). The 2TB plan also comes with a VPN for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxaryX"&gt;Before you run to invest in Google One, be aware that there are several mitigating factors Google is offering its users. When the new plan goes into effect, that is when the clock starts; photos you uploaded before then won’t count toward your 15GB limit. Also, if you’re a Pixel owner, then you can continue to upload high-quality photos without affecting your 15GB limit. (Of course, Pixel owners used to get unlimited original quality for free, rather than having to upload their photos in “high quality.” But hey, it’s something.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTIED4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/photos"&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iCloud Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHlPR3hHSzYXLHM4BHWLPypgyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045506/Screen_Shot_2020_11_16_at_9.50.00_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIMWLM"&gt;If you’re part of Apple’s ecosystem, then you have easy access to iCloud Photos, Apple’s equivalent to Google Photos. iCloud Photos is connected to the Phone app on your Mac or iOS device as a backup for your photos. You automatically get 5GB of storage space associated with your iCloud account; after that, it costs 99 cents per month for 50GB, $2.99 per month for 200GB, and $9.99 per month for 2TB. (This is for the US; &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"&gt;other countries have different fees&lt;/a&gt;.) Windows users can also access iCloud Photos via an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283"&gt;associated app&lt;/a&gt;; Android users will have to access it using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yZr3Oh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flickr page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rs5L-CTH_oyitP0u2yut9q5965c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13692625/flickr_interface.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flickr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0WoADA"&gt;Flickr has a free plan as well, but it’s limited to 1,000 photos — within certain guidelines: photo files are limited to 200MB and video files to 1GB. For &lt;a href="https://help.flickr.com/pricing-faq-r1qHsTEbU"&gt;unlimited storage without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you pay either $6.99 a month or $59.99 annually (plus tax). Other advantages to a paid annual membership include stats about which of your photos are trending and a variety of discounts from several companies, including Adobe and SmugMug (which is now part of Flickr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BrJgci"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smugmug.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Smugmug" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w07DX4OmmluqYJWke4hyZfYgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22032766/smugmug.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: SmugMug&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmugMug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mH6JCv"&gt;Speaking of SmugMug, this long-lasting service is also available, offering storage, portfolios, and sales opportunities for professionals. For $55 a year or $7 a month, you get unlimited uploads and a customizable website. The Power plan ($85 a year or $11 monthly) adds site customization and your own domain name. If you’re looking to be a professional photographer, the Portfolio plan adds e-commerce features for $200 a year or $27 a month (you keep 85 percent of the markup). And finally, the Pro plan lets you create events, price lists, and branded orders, among other features, for $360 a year or $42 a month. If you’re interested in trying it out, you can get a two-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3pftc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://500px.com/"&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="500px" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OvSPHukZyZ_L03o3HavAkQfYvd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045546/500px_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: 500px&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;500px&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YKFo5I"&gt;Canadian company 500px is actually more for professional photographers than your average snap-and-save picture taker. It offers pros a place to store, exhibit, and license their work. So if you have ambitions to start peddling your photos, 500px may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oJbxb"&gt;The site offers two paid plans. The first, modestly named Awesome, offers unlimited uploads, priority support, no ads, a history of “liked” photos, gallery slideshows, and a profile badge for $59.88 a year or $4.99 monthly. The Pro plan adds a way to display your services and organization tools for $119.88 a year or $9.99 monthly. (You get a discount on your first year: Awesome costs $47.88 a year or $3.99 monthly, while Pro goes for $71.88 a year or $5.99 monthly.) And if you want to make a bit of money, you can submit your photos to be licensed for stock usage through 500px. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67i7IV"&gt;There is a free ad-supported plan that gives you seven uploads a week. When you sign up, you can try out the Pro plan for two weeks before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZgbkNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.photobucket.com/explore"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photobucket" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRnWvdW4CSwYhI3v_juEr5ai-1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504081/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.54.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photobucket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fui9Kk"&gt;Photobucket offers a limited free plan, allowing you to upload up to 250 photos for free — more a trial plan than anything else. If you like what you see, you can start with the Beginner plan at $5.99 per month or $64.68 annually, which gives you 25GB of storage, along with no ads, password-protected album sharing, and an image editor. For $7.99 per month or $86.28 annually, the Intermediate plan provides 250GB of storage and unlimited image hosting. Finally, for $12.99 per month or $140.28 annually, the Expert plan offers unlimited storage and no image compression, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1bm9gL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="DeviantArt" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CgcJg8R-ExLnrm10unHvuB1l4Pc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504090/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.57.24_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z7uIFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt; calls itself “the world’s largest art community” with a social network for visual artists of all kinds. It offers visitors a wide range of artist galleries to view, divided into categories such as traditional, animation, and illustrations. DeviantArt (or DA for short) even has its own publishing platform called Sta.sh — emphasizing the fact that this site, like 500px, is less for simple storage and more for showing (and selling) your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YBRVT"&gt;With a free membership in DeviantArt, there are no restrictions on how much you upload for public access, and you get admission to DA’s community of artists and art lovers. &lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/core-membership/"&gt;Core Members enjoy additional perks&lt;/a&gt;. For $3.95 a month or $39.95 a year, you get to sell your art with no service fee (but a 20 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales) and a $100 max price per digital item, along with 20GB of private storage space in Sta.sh. For $7.95 a month or $79.95 a year, you can charge up to $1,000 per item and pay a 12 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales, along with 30GB of private storage. Finally, $14.95 a month or $149.95 a year lets you charge up to $10,000 per item, lowers your fee to 10 percent fee per sale, and gets you 50GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iBQOi3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage"&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyGvuT12uD0xtAZPBYAG3hjy6Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504092/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.58.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRZOow"&gt;Amazon provides its Prime members with a grab bag of extras along with the free shipping. In addition to the video offerings, music streaming, and other goodies, you get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos"&gt;unlimited photo storage&lt;/a&gt; for $119 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzQzPt"&gt;A nice perk is that you can share that unlimited storage with five friends or family members in what is called the Family Vault. Everything there is accessible to everyone who shares the Vault. “Unlimited,” by the way, does not include videos or other files; for those, Prime members get 5GB of storage, and after that, there is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage/plans"&gt;a long list of storage plans&lt;/a&gt; available starting from $1.99 a month for 100GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJVY1"&gt;That’s something to keep in mind if you drop your Prime membership. In that case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201480950"&gt;according to the Amazon instructions&lt;/a&gt;, “the unlimited photo storage benefits associated with the membership end. All uploaded photos count toward your Amazon Drive storage limit.” The total storage for non-Prime members (stills and video) is 5GB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bZluEe"&gt;Unlike 500px and DeviantArt, which are tailored more toward professional creators, Degoo is geared toward the everyday photographer who uses images to make memories. In fact, the site touts its AI engine, which it says will “show you the best moments of your life.” To that end, its free ad-based version provides 100GB of storage; you can view or download photos on an unlimited number of devices but only upload from three. You also have to access your account at least every 90 days to keep it active. Paid accounts include Pro ($2.99 / month), which removes the ads and time limit and gives you 500GB of storage, and Ultimate ($9.99 / month), which gives you a whopping 10TB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube pulled its community captions feature, so now more creators are making their own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration depicting hands holding up captions on a YouTube video." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tYzRXztJ17pcN7j6UVEzL4H7dNQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322838/acastro_210518_4590_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEKmjf"&gt;Jack Edwards doesn’t want to be praised for doing what he considers the bare minimum: making his videos accessible to his deaf and hard of hearing viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E7gbv"&gt;Edwards began making book and lifestyle videos on YouTube five years ago, but he only started captioning all of his videos in January. “It was one of my goals this year to invest more time into making my channel more accessible for viewers,” he says. “I always think about the quote, ‘It’s a privilege to learn, rather than to experience,’ and that’s true for so many accessibility issues. I don’t rely on subtitles to enjoy YouTube content, so it’s easy to forget that others do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5nOSHr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Captions are up 30 percent year to year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="95Vhnw"&gt;More creators like Edwards have been writing captions for their videos over the past year, providing subtitles so that more viewers can engage with their content without having to hear or understand the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5vAcn"&gt;It’s a result deaf campaigners considered almost impossible about a year ago, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;YouTube nixed community caption contributions&lt;/a&gt;. Most YouTube channels don’t upload captions for their videos, so it fell on subscribers to volunteer high-quality subtitles for fellow viewers to read. Yet, in September, YouTube &lt;a href="https://liamodell.com/2020/09/28/youtube-community-captions-translations-ccs-dontremoveyoutubeccs-creator-insider-deaf-rikki-poynter-amara/"&gt;scrapped the feature&lt;/a&gt; allowing for viewer-submitted captions, citing “low usage” and “abuse.” Creators had to start making captions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k35M9O"&gt;When the plans were &lt;a href="https://teneightymagazine.com/2020/04/24/youtube-to-review-community-captions-feature/"&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, deaf YouTuber Rikki Poynter, a prolific captions campaigner, gave me a very bleak forecast. “Community contributions gave us more captioned channels and now we will risk having less of that.” Half a million people signed &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-don-t-remove-community-captions-from-youtube"&gt;an online petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on YouTube to reverse the decision, and thousands of Twitter users got the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontRemoveYoutubeCCs?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#DontRemoveYouTubeCCs&lt;/a&gt; trending in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="hJjZEa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Viewers have encouraged creators to fill the gaps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CK6vJg"&gt;But over the past year, more creators have started adding captions of their own. Compared to August — the month before community captions were deprecated — total user-submitted captions in January were up by more than 20 percent, a YouTube spokesperson told me. Year on year, from January 2020 to January 2021, the increase was by more than 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69y61G"&gt;“We’re delighted that creators are finding our captioning tools helpful for their videos,” the spokesperson said over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8irPC"&gt;Even though new tools such as a brand-new captions editor and the ability to add captions during the upload process were made available&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in July 2020 and May 2021, respectively, for some, the incentive to start captioning came from somewhere else: their viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpz5O9"&gt;“I got a message on Twitter about how YouTube was planning on dropping an important [closed captions] feature a few months ago and that it could mean that there wouldn’t be any for my hard of hearing viewers,” said Kennie J.D., who creates videos on makeup and films for an audience of almost 570,000 people. “I found that horrible, so I’ve been paying for a service called Rev.com that makes captions for my videos after they go up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XHlRPQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If hearing people and the like can enjoy content, why can’t we too?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PO2Ib"&gt;Poynter suggests that more awareness about the importance of captions is behind the 20 percent increase — that, and the idea that creators have “got no other choice now,” since they can’t rely on viewers to fill the gap. Whatever the reason, she isn’t the only one who benefits from the rise in subtitles. “[It’s] also people with ADHD, auditory processing disorder, or [those] learning whatever the spoken language the video is in. So many groups of people are missing out,” she says. “If hearing people and the like can enjoy content, why can’t we too?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PV72t"&gt;Poor-quality captions don’t help things, either. YouTube does provide automatic captions through speech recognition, but many deaf users consider them inaccurate and unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yp1Get"&gt;So it falls to deaf activists and YouTubers like Poynter to call on others to write their own captions. “I used to send out personal emails to many YouTubers a year asking them to caption their content,” she says. “During VidCon and Playlist Live seasons for a few years, I even personally hand wrote letters and mailed it out to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6L4vmO"&gt;YouTube added the ability to add captions in the “upload flow” earlier this month. In the past, the social media site failed to promote its captioning features well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqpfHJ"&gt;Poynter notes that the reported increase in manual captions is great, but they still need further promotion. For now, it seems, the community is doing YouTube’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWx0wX"&gt;“[Captioning is] something I hope all creators who make content full-time will start to do,” Edwards says. “While it’s really lovely to receive a little ‘thank you’ message as a token of someone’s appreciation, it’s also important to recognize the even more important work being done by deaf or hard of hearing creators on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd7QV1"&gt;Commenting on YouTube’s recent promotion of captions in a tweet on Twitter, Poynter says: “They’re going to need to be more consistent about it. I do like that the uploading process now has a more accessible [way of adding captions]. When people actually see it, they’re a little more likely to want to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
