    <title>Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jack Dorsey will appear at March misinfo hearing</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8knLnG"&gt;The House Energy and Commerce Committee has called a new hearing on platform misinformation, to include testimony from Facebook, Google and Twitter. Scheduled for March 25th, the hearing will be a joint effort from the Communications and Technology subcommittee and the Consumer Protection and Commerce subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQRAvQ"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey are all scheduled to testify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cD6bnx"&gt;“This hearing will continue the Committee’s work of holding online platforms accountable for the growing rise of misinformation and disinformation,” the chairs of the committees said in a joint statement. “For far too long, big tech has failed to acknowledge the role they’ve played in fomenting and elevating blatantly false information to its online audiences. Industry self-regulation has failed. We must begin the work of changing incentives driving social media companies to allow and even promote misinformation and disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OnNgL"&gt;Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg were previously called before Congress in November, for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/17/tech-hearing-dorsey-zuckerberg/"&gt;the Senate Judiciary’s impromptu hearing&lt;/a&gt; on moderation and misinformation labelling. However, this will be the first hearing they have attended since the January 6th attack on the US Capitol and the various deplatforming efforts that followed. All three companies have since removed former President Donald Trump from their platforms (in Google’s case, through YouTube), actions that remain deeply controversial among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is having another go at explaining its privacy policy to users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="WhatsApp stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8F9yHgB-gRXv5FBQwFwWmGhkHs=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838853/WhatsApp1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGM3dT"&gt;WhatsApp has a new plan to explain its contentious privacy policy — the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; when users grew concerned the platform would share their messages with parent company Facebook. In an announcement on Thursday, the company explained how users can read through the new policy and learn how business and personal messages — which have different privacy standards — are handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaTmBM"&gt;The new privacy policy primarily concerns messaging businesses on WhatsApp and what parts of your data those businesses have access to. Most WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they can only be accessed by the people actually talking. But WhatsApp also lets users message businesses, and those messages aren’t extended the same protections. The data in business messages can be used for commercial purposes like ad targeting on Facebook, and some of them are also stored on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp’s privacy policy was an attempt to explain that change, but many users interpreted it as WhatsApp comprising the privacy focus it was known for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mk5JhiEgy3brAIplu44ieGNlXdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312921/image002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s new banner and privacy policy explainer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="92FNL4"&gt;Ahead of the new May 15th launch (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;moved from February 8th&lt;/a&gt;), WhatsApp plans to offer users the ability to review this new privacy policy inside its app. The company already tried to reassure users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22257721/whatsapp-status-privacy-facebook-signal-telegram"&gt;through WhatsApp’s Status feature&lt;/a&gt;, but now WhatsApp will include a banner that can be tapped to pull up the explanation of the new policy. The company says it will eventually remind users to read the new policy and accept it to continue using the app as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REd6tD"&gt;WhatsApp also notes that businesses pay for the right to use WhatsApp to reach customers, and that’s one of the ways WhatsApp is able to provide its app for free. The main features of WhatsApp remain as private as ever. Of course, it’s not as private as some users might think: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;WhatsApp started sharing some personal information&lt;/a&gt; like phone numbers and profile photos with Facebook in 2016 to improve friend recommendations and ads on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R81gUH"&gt;WhatsApp’s tone in this redo of its policy change is somewhat apologetic. It didn’t explain what was changing well enough to users, and it’s owning up to that. But WhatsApp also managed to sneak in a dig at other companies that welcomed the exodus from WhatsApp prompted by the policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0irFGs"&gt;During this time, we understand some people may check out other apps to see what they have to offer. We’ve seen some of our competitors try to get away with claiming they can’t see people’s messages — if an app doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default that means they can read your messages. Other apps say they’re better because they know even less information than WhatsApp. We believe people are looking for apps to be both reliable and safe, even if that requires WhatsApp having some limited data. We strive to be thoughtful on the decisions we make and we’ll continue to develop new ways of meeting these responsibilities with less information, not more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gVSiP3"&gt;WhatsApp is obliquely referencing Telegram, an app that, along with Signal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1349014065931284480%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226792%2Fwhatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;seemed to benefit&lt;/a&gt; from the confusion over what was changing in WhatsApp. Telegram &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415"&gt;has dealt with its own criticism&lt;/a&gt; over not enabling end-to-end encryption by default — and clearly, WhatsApp doesn’t want you to forget that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance rover successfully lands on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zajpO1lw5Ojig9Lg2-SzH4p_oKQ=/0x36:1321x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838834/EuiZR2xUcAMxfsq.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The first image taking by NASA’s Perseverance rover after touching down on Thursday. | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYE31Q"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover has successfully touched down on the surface of Mars after surviving a blazing seven-minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere. The rover’s clean landing sets the stage for a years-long journey to scour the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater for ancient signs of life. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iguGP-kNHRa9MVpqkhTcFm9cOL4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313288/ayyy.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A live video feed from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California showed mission engineers cheer upon confirmation of a clean Perseverance touchdown.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZYHdV"&gt;“Touchdown confirmed,” Swati Mohan, a member of NASA’s entry, descent and landing team, said. “Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars ready to begin seeking the signs of past life.” The landing team of roughly 30 engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California jumped from their seats and cheered at the confirmation. Moments after touching down, Perseverance beamed back its first image from one of its 19 cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxo4FE"&gt;Perseverance hit Mars’ atmosphere on time at 3:48PM ET at speeds of about 12,100 miles per hour, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287160/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-landing-watch-live-stream-start-time"&gt;diving toward the surface in an infamously challenging sequence&lt;/a&gt; engineers call the “seven minutes of terror.” With an 11-minute comms delay between Mars and Earth, the spacecraft had to carry out its seven-minute plunge at all by itself with a wickedly complex set of pre-programmed instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7U7WW7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m safe on Mars. Perseverance will get you anywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1362506126839848961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="upO6OS"&gt;Enduring blazing heat, the rover was shielded by a protective shell and parachute to help slow itself down. A descent stage with six rocket thrusters fired as it neared the surface, slowing Perseverance to a much calmer 2 mph. Clutching the rover, the descent stage hovered 66 feet above the surface to execute a “skycrane” maneuver, where it gently lowered Perseverance on a set of cables the rest of the way to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uaOiCD"&gt;Once the rover planted its six wheels on the surface, it snipped the skycrane cables, prompting the rocket-powered descent stage to move itself far away from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znSrB8"&gt;The SUV-sized rover has traveled 293 million miles since launching last summer in a slim window of time as Earth and Mars closely aligned in their orbits around the Sun. That alignment comes once every two years, and NASA launched its rover alongside China and UAE, whose Martian spacecraft reached the planet earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWMdbh"&gt;Toward the end of its seven-month journey, Perseverance’s cruise stage carried out fewer orbital correction maneuvers than originally planned, in part due to an ultra-precise insertion on its Mars trajectory when it launched atop an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance. “When we hit the bullseye, that means they had a ton more propellant” that NASA didn’t have to use on its journey to Mars, ULA CEO Tory Bruno told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tV93ws"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pPFXG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDBG0h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWJowx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A streamer completed a sweet, juicy Hades run using a literal pomegranate controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUTR9UEmkcppnZp_k44JK-2h2Go=/245x107:2635x1700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838631/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_9.01.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rudeism&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZmNE5X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, Supergiant Games’ Greek-themed roguelike, can be a pretty tough game. But one intrepid Twitch streamer took it upon himself to up the challenge by beating the game in an incredibly nontraditional way: by using a controller made out of an actual pomegranate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFQXBj"&gt;Pomegranates are a big part of the game, serving as &lt;a href="https://hades.gamepedia.com/Pom_of_Power"&gt;useful power-ups&lt;/a&gt;, and they also have an &lt;a href="https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/pomegranate-fruit-myths-made/"&gt;important place in Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;. But I never imagined that someone could use a real-life pomegranate to defeat the final boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7kEiK"&gt;To make the controller, streamer Dylan “Rudeism” Beck cut up a pomegranate into 10 pieces, wired the pieces to a &lt;a href="https://makeymakey.com/"&gt;MakeyMakey circuit board&lt;/a&gt; to make them act as capacitive touch buttons, and taped an earth wire from his arm to the board. Here’s how the contraption works, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QEg3iC1O_HM?t=221"&gt;according to Beck&lt;/a&gt;: “My arm will be connected to the MakeyMakey via the earth wire, and then when I touch one of the pomegranates, it then creates a loop between me, the pomegranate, and the circuit board, and that’s what does inputs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irc0rK"&gt;You can watch Beck put the controller together (and make his first attempt to beat the game with it) in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QEg3iC1O_HM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8MTdMb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEg3iC1O_HM?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=257&amp;amp;start=257" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tZHL5k"&gt;Beck first tried to play the game with a pomegranate &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/911752639"&gt;six days ago&lt;/a&gt;, and he has been &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/913264431"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/917393094"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; ever since, chasing an elusive escape from the Underworld. Overnight, Beck finally did it, successfully defeating the game’s final boss in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1362376886827896832"&gt;an epic battle&lt;/a&gt; that included two heart-stopping controller failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Dtgcs1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vcxDS"&gt;This isn’t Beck’s first attempt at playing a game with a nontraditional controller — it’s actually &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Rudeism/videos"&gt;kind of his thing&lt;/a&gt;. Among other notable feats, he won a round of the adorable battle royale platformer &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JDH8KC2vCxY"&gt;jelly beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Older Pixel phones are having serious camera issues, according to owners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s Pixel 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AcioPDPYC-0AZskGoMsZWdtHwR8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838515/jbareham_171013_2050_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The issue appears to affect the Pixel 2 series, but may be spreading to newer phones. | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5e9POr"&gt;Some owners of previous-generation Pixel phones are having serious trouble with their cameras. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/16/hardware-failures-may-be-to-blame-for-increase-in-reports-of-pixel-camera-issues/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; has noticed&lt;/a&gt; a recent increase in one-star &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera"&gt;Play Store reviews&lt;/a&gt; for the camera app used by the Pixel, with frustrated owners saying the camera often crashes upon opening or no longer works at all. A &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/70290821?hl=en"&gt;thread in Google’s Pixel support forum&lt;/a&gt; features similar complaints. The Pixel 2 XL seems to be cited most often for experiencing the problem, but some posters say they’re having trouble with devices as recent as the 3 or 4A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5FVU6"&gt;It’s not an entirely new problem. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/25/pixel-2-camera-curse-continues-and-its-spreading-to-newer-pixels/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; has been tracking camera issues&lt;/a&gt; that have plagued Pixel 2 phones primarily over the last year, and it notes more devices seem to be affected now. Owners say that Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/6306624?hl=en"&gt;suggested fixes&lt;/a&gt; don’t remedy the problem and that they experience the same problem when using third-party camera apps. The Pixel 2 series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164027/google-pixel-2-final-update-security-patch-november-2020"&gt;recently got its last security update&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no logical reason why the camera should stop functioning as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AICHpW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Owners say Google’s suggested fixes don’t remedy the problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="75UomK"&gt;It’s an unfortunate bug, especially considering that many folks chose a Pixel phone because of its high-quality camera. While Pixel image quality has fallen behind other flagship competition recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;budget devices like the 4A&lt;/a&gt; and 4A 5G offer some of the best cameras in their class. But the best camera is the one that keeps functioning when you need it, so we hope to see Google address these user concerns. We’ve reached out to Google asking for confirmation of the issue and if a fix is on the way and will update this article with any information we get.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="semjRE"&gt;A coalition of tech and business groups have joined together for a lawsuit challenging Maryland’s newly passed digital services tax, as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/18/amazon-facebook-google-maryland-lawsuit-tax/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312984/document_20_.pdf"&gt;filed in federal district court in Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, argues the state tax is preempted by federal law and violates various constitutional prohibitions against state taxes on out-of-state activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii4qjb"&gt;The lawsuit is led by the US Chamber of Commerce, which is joined by three tech industry groups: Internet Association, NetChoice, and Computer &amp;amp; Communications Industry Association. Membership varies, but &lt;a href="https://internetassociation.org/our-members/"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://netchoice.org/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ccianet.org/about/members/"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; count Google, Facebook, and Amazon as members, as well as other tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4cYNC"&gt;The Maryland law would establish a new gross revenue tax on digital advertising undertaken by non-media companies — targeted squarely at the ad revenue collected by tech giants like Facebook and Google. The tax rate varies depending on the size of the company, but it would range as high as 10 percent for companies with global annual revenue higher than $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6o698j"&gt;Prior to passage, a number of state politicians raised concerns about the legality of the bill — most notably Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, who identified “some risk that a reviewing court would find that the tax is unconstitutional” in &lt;a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2020RS/ag_letters/hb0732.pdf"&gt;a public letter in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unB15O"&gt;Maryland Gov. Lawrence Hogan opposed the bill, but the state’s General Assembly &lt;a href="https://www.stateandlocaltax.com/digital-economy/the-latest-on-marylands-digital-advertising-tax/"&gt;overrode his veto&lt;/a&gt; to pass it into law on February 12th. The tax is set to go into effect 30 days after passage unless the lawsuit’s injunction is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGKDYg"&gt;Digital tax proposals have become increasingly common as tech giants have grown more profitable and less popular — but the taxes remained hotly contested by the tech industry. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418114/european-uk-digital-tax-services-apple-google-amazon-raise-prices"&gt;A UK digital service tax passed in 2020&lt;/a&gt; resulted in enterprise rate hikes from many US tech companies, while the staggered implementation of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-digital-tax-detente-ends-as-u-s-and-france-exchange-blows-11609333200"&gt;France’s digital services tax&lt;/a&gt; has sparked a standoff with US trade officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8g4xWi"&gt;Then-presidential candidate Andrew Yang proposed a US digital services tax &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964834/andrew-yang-digital-ads-tax-elizabeth-warren-antitrust-tech-facebook-google"&gt;as part of his 2020 primary campaign&lt;/a&gt;, but the idea has failed to gain traction among US lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Office 2021, available for Windows and macOS later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YF8Vc7q-zF5_EBrvgAAHWYwsXxg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838438/officeicons.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZrKXVy"&gt;Microsoft is announcing two new versions of Office today: a consumer Office 2021 version and Office LTSC for commercial customers. Office 2021 will be available later this year for both Windows and macOS, and similar to the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16366150/microsoft-office-2019-features-release-date"&gt;Office 2019 release&lt;/a&gt;, it’s designed for those who don’t want to subscribe to the cloud-powered Microsoft 365 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDkfb8"&gt;Microsoft isn’t fully detailing all of the features and changes in Office 2021 just yet, but the Office LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) variant will include things like dark mode support, accessibility improvements, and features like Dynamic Arrays and XLOOKUP in Excel. Office 2021 will include similar features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfpTfQ"&gt;Don’t expect any major UI changes here, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274181/microsoft-word-dark-mode-canvas-update-beta"&gt;Dark mode&lt;/a&gt; is the obvious change visually, but Microsoft will still focus most of its interface and cloud-powered features on the Microsoft 365 versions of Office first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvPrM3"&gt;Office LTSC is a clear recognition from Microsoft that not all of its business customers are ready to move to the cloud, though. “It’s just a matter of trying to meet customers where they are,” explains Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We certainly have a lot of customers that have moved to the cloud over the last 10 months, that’s happened en masse really. At the same time, we definitely have customers who have specific scenarios where they don’t feel like they can move to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiuHh63G8T-dKETHBFhCc8EiKm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291771/darkmodenewquick.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new dark mode in Word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qcnLxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This next Office release is for those who don’t want Microsoft 365&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Io6Q"&gt;Those specific scenarios include regulated industries where processes and apps can’t change on a monthly basis, or manufacturing plants that rely on Office and want a locked-in time release. Microsoft is also committing to another perpetual version of Office for the future, but it’s changing up pricing and how these new versions will be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGxMvi"&gt;Office LTSC will now only be supported for five years instead of the seven that Microsoft has typically provided for Office. Pricing for Office Professional Plus, Office Standard, and individual apps is also increasing 10 percent for commercial customers, with the Office 2021 consumer and small business pricing remaining the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzv3zj"&gt;The Office LTSC support timing aligns more closely with how Windows is supported, and Microsoft is also aligning its release schedules for both Office and Windows more closely as a result. Both of the next versions of Office LTSC and Windows 10 LTSC will be released in the second half of 2021. “They will be closely timed, although we don’t have the details yet for the Windows release,” says Spataro. “The idea is to bring them close together so that enterprises can deploy and manage them on a similar type of cadence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3VZbb"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to release a preview of Office LTSC in April, with a full release later this year. The consumer Office 2021 variant won’t be available in preview, though. Both of the new Office variants will also ship with OneNote and include 32-bit and 64-bit versions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s 360-degree Mars landing broadcast is now live from the best seat in the house</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH6oov2vI_Aw9rvIfaBCly_ajIo=/253x0:2608x1570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838419/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_11.40.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YYFedF"&gt;NASA is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287160/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-landing-watch-live-stream-start-time"&gt;landing a rover on Mars today&lt;/a&gt;, February 18th, but if you’re looking for a different perspective than the traditional live stream, &lt;a href="https://t.co/58eLesCdfs?amp=1"&gt;the space agency is currently streaming the scene from inside mission control&lt;/a&gt; — in an immersive 360 degrees. You can look around to watch people as they go about their work, but there are also big virtual screens displaying multiple other views, including NASA’s other live stream. It might be the best way to experience the landing because you’ll get it all simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1FbMz"&gt;At the time of writing, the stream is broadcasting interviews with key mission staff, explaining the purpose of today’s landing, as well as some of the technical jargon that’ll start getting thrown around once Perseverance begins its descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eftrs2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Mars Landing LIVE in 360º&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s landing day in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt; and it’s as if you’re right here with us. Get a view from inside our Mission Control as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAPersevere&lt;/a&gt;’s team works through the toughest Mars landing yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best via the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTube&lt;/a&gt; app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/58eLesCdfs"&gt;https://t.co/58eLesCdfs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/A2AMs36JUW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A2AMs36JUW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1362480953336098816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEt8QX"&gt;NASA has offered a 360-degree stream inside Mission Control for other missions before, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0yOTanzx-s&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;including its 2018 InSight Mars landing&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s still a really neat experience to see inside the control room, especially during such a historic mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLcgyP"&gt;If you want to see something akin to what a rover can see on the planet itself, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937050/nasa-mars-curiosity-rover-360-degree-video-tour"&gt;also has previously produced 360-degree views from the surface of Mars&lt;/a&gt;. And if you’d rather watch mission control from a more produced, less “choose your own” perspective, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPrbJ63qUc4"&gt;has a “clean” live stream as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is making The Trial of the Chicago 7 free on YouTube for 48 hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UbciggKGkdE3HZfvgE5t00tOWF0=/96x0:840x496/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838215/The_Trial_of_the_Chicago_7_new.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F4mfjN"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Trial of the Chicago 7 &lt;/em&gt;will be available for free on its YouTube channel for 48 hours, starting on Friday, February 19th, at 12AM PT, &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-whole-world-was-and-is-watching"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the company (&lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-the-trial-of-the-chicago-7-free-on-youtube-48-hours-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. Writer and director Aaron Sorkin said the movie is being shown for free to “commemorate the anniversary of the verdict in this historic trial,” and he praised the people depicted in the movie as “the real patriots who inspired a generation — actually, generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufL1QF"&gt;The film centers on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven"&gt;the eight Vietnam war protestors&lt;/a&gt; who were charged with inciting a riot and conspiracy for demonstrating during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Sorkin is no stranger to political subject matter, notably working on &lt;em&gt;The West Wing &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/em&gt;, even though he’s perhaps better known for films like &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZOK5o"&gt;This isn’t the first time Netflix has made some of its content free on YouTube. Last April, it made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225143/netflix-doumentaries-free-youtube-our-planet-13th-babies-explained"&gt;several of its documentaries available on the platform&lt;/a&gt;, many of which seem to still be up, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSo2hZRcXk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knock Down the House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and episodes of nature docuseries &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtXC_n6X6Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Planet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKa8EA"&gt;Netflix providing its original movies and shows for free on YouTube could be a way to introduce people to its content, especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;it no longer offers free trials for its service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCfKBi"&gt;If you’re interested in seeing the movie but don’t have Netflix, it’ll be available on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWOA1ZGywLbqmigxE4Qlvuw"&gt;Netflix’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; starting Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hM2ZmX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVb6EdKDBfU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to easily install the Android 12 developer preview</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9HBAEQVKp6e725lbGLfEysg0bU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66886289/jbareham_181010_2989_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlhtBR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 18th, 2:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Google released the first of its &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 developer previews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so we’ve updated the info in this post to be relevant if you want to install it on your phone. The instructional photos might include a mention of Android 11, but we’ve ensured the steps are still accurate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEa7Ku"&gt;You can try out the Android 12 developer preview software right now if you have a Pixel 3 or later, but it’s understandable if the idea of flashing your device to install the OS is intimidating. It can be a tricky process, and the steps differ slightly depending on what phone you have and what kind of computer you’re going to use to download the software. But Google itself makes this process much more streamlined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6mztn"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download"&gt;Android Flash Tool&lt;/a&gt; is a web application that handles most of the steps of flashing for you. There are a few steps that you’ll need to do yourself before the new software can be installed, which we’ll walk you through below, but Google’s tool basically eliminates most of the hassle and complexity that makes it easy to mess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnBR1D"&gt;There are a few important notes to make up here at the top. First, once you flash your phone with the developer preview, your device will get all future developer preview and beta updates over the air. In other words, you won’t need to flash your phone again when new builds of Android 12 are released. Just head to your system settings and fetch an update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58Olby"&gt;The second note is just your standard disclaimer that you do this at your own risk. This is unfinished software, and installing it could lead to malfunctions with your device or to software that you usually use. And depending on settings that you adjust in the Android Flash Tool, you might have to wipe all of the data from your phone. So proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIGG-Z2OspcNqk1d8fR6JICl6vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19303885/vpavic_191018_3725_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SPg2X6"&gt;Is my phone compatible with Android 12?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSEp5"&gt;The Android 12 developer preview is compatible with the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3A, Pixel 3A XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, and the Pixel 5. It’s possible that Google will broaden the list of devices supported by Android 12 in the upcoming beta, but for now, you’ll need one of those phones to get the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nWnG91"&gt;What browser do I need to use to flash my phone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fwlb97"&gt;Google says that you can use any browser that supports the WebUSB API, which is supported by Chrome as well as Microsoft Edge version 79 and later. The Android Flash Tool works with all the major operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Chrome OS, and Windows 10, though browser compatibility may vary depending on your OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wxx6Rr"&gt;Step 1: Activate these three settings on your Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BMI7cK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable the Developer Options menu&lt;/strong&gt; in your phone. First, open the Settings app. For phones running Android 8 (Oreo), click System. Otherwise, if your phone has Android 7 (Nougat) or later, scroll down to About Phone, then find Build Number. Tap Build Number seven times to enable Developer Options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dO4knj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Turn on USB debugging&lt;/strong&gt; (this lets your phone and computer communicate via USB) within the Developer Options menu. To do this, head to Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Developer Options. You’ll find USB debugging with just a little scrolling down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElHgpn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable OEM unlocking&lt;/strong&gt;. This option is also part of the Developer Options menu, further up the page than where you found USB debugging. If that option isn’t available for you to enable, that might be because it’s already enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csscsUs89Ir1CKE5Rd299XIo9bU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16213698/vpavic_190503_3404_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HzryhV"&gt;Step 2: Connect your phone to your computer and get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OSeB6k"&gt;If you use Windows 10, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb"&gt;you’ll need to install this driver&lt;/a&gt; first for your phone to be recognized.  People using macOS or Linux don’t need a driver. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="weswdD"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable. Then &lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/preview/dp1"&gt;visit this page to proceed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NbuEfq"&gt;The Android Flash Tool will ask for permission to access ADB keys in a pop-up window, which is necessary to install software on your phone. You’ll need to tap “OK” to proceed with this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android Flash Tool for Android 11" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R3SlZ5sAdLEg5Bm14ClFdb7XjIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014977/4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need to hit OK to proceed with the installation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WpBss1"&gt;Click “Select device.” Your device should appear in a pop-up window on your computer, so go ahead and click it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0ljh0M"&gt;Once you do that, you should now see a request on your phone that says “Allow USB debugging?” You’ll also see a long string of numbers and letters that should match up with what your PC shows if you click the gear icon on the Android Flash Tool page. On your phone, check the box next to “Always allow from this computer,” then tap Allow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jHjb7D"&gt;After that, your device should show up on the Android Flash Tool as being connected. Click on the box with the name of your device to proceed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oqEnVwEk_QE3UUVA0Z1kLBWYGvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014998/8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once your device shows up as being connected, click into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sjTlzI"&gt;You’ll want to pay attention to what appears in the “Selected build” section of the Flash Tool (see below). It should say “Android 12 Developer Preview 1.” Before you hit the blue “Install” button at the bottom of the page, I recommend tapping the pencil icon next to “Selected build” and checking the “Lock Bootloader” box. This will lock the bootloader after this process is complete, leaving you with a more secure device than if it remained unlocked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4ejoA2xy7n9DiZCVdq1AtGd6ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014994/6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the “Lock Bootloader” option, which will lock your bootloader after the software installation is complete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="QyzbSn"&gt;The next window basically tells you to stop interacting with your phone during the rest of this process unless asked to do so and to not unplug your device. If you’re in a position to proceed, go ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRc70KHCAQGodzC1Gat0h2vS2PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015001/1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure your data is backed up before you proceed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XlJyBQ"&gt;One more prompt before getting started: a license agreement. You need to agree to the terms of the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement, which you can find &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/terms"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0FIfKs"&gt;After you hit “I accept,” your phone will reboot into its bootloader screen. If nothing happens for a few seconds, don’t worry. You may also see a window pop up on your computer that says “Reselect your device.” In that case, leave your phone alone and select “Reselect device” on the computer. According to Google, your phone might be renamed “Android,” though it might just be identified with the model name (e.g., Pixel 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zdpkzo"&gt;If you haven’t flashed software before, Google will probably need to unlock your bootloader to proceed with the installation. Keep in mind that doing this will trigger a factory reset on your phone. If you haven’t backed up your data, you’ll lose everything. Once you agree, you’ll need to allow the bootloader to unlock on your phone. To do this, use the volume keys to navigate to the option that says “Unlock the bootloader,” then hit the power button once to confirm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0LiOV5"&gt;After that, the Android Flash Tool will begin to download and install the software. You can continue to watch along, but don’t touch your phone at this point, even though it will restart several times. Just keep an eye on the progress using the Android Flash Tool page on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAaw6d7-Vu3g4ted-MHrdzXS7bA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015017/9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point, you can just sit and wait for the Android Flash Tool to wrap things up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wQDNXV"&gt;Once you’re all done, the phone will reboot one last time, and over on your PC, you’ll be met with a celebratory screen. You’re all done! And thankfully, you won’t have to go through this process again for the next Android 12 update — easy as this was. You’ll automatically receive updates to the developer preview over the air.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re all done!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
