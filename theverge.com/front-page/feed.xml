    <title>Rep. Gosar anime video highlights ties to the online right</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7zuCh"&gt;Republican Congressman Paul Gosar (AZ) ignited national fury this week after tweeting a video portraying himself as an anime character killing other prominent lawmakers. But while Democrats are now calling for his expulsion from Congress and his accounts to be banned, the incident has drawn new attention to Gosar’s long association with far-right meme culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9fl3L"&gt;Gosar first posted the problematic video parodying the opening credits of the popular anime series “Attack on Titan” on Sunday. The video — captioned “Any anime fans out there?” — depicts Gosar as one of the show’s main characters killing Democratic politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and President Joe  Biden by superimposing their faces onto those belonging to other characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPMHJW"&gt;Responding to the video on Monday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1457888052991381508?s=20"&gt;Ocasio-Cortez tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that “a creepy member I work with who fundraises for Neo-Nazi groups shared a fantasy video of him killing me,” likely referring to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=paul+gosar+fundraising+far-right&amp;amp;oq=paul+gosar+fundraising+far-right&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5466j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;a summer fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; linked to far-right influencer Nicholas Fuentes. She continued, “He’ll face no consequences,” because House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-CA) “cheers him on with no excuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXm710"&gt;The video was posted onto Gosar’s official congressional Twitter account and was viewed over 3 million times before it was removed. It’s unclear if Twitter or Gosar’s office removed the video as of publication. On Monday, Twitter placed a “public interest notice” over the tweet, saying that it violated the company’s policies against hateful conduct. Instagram also placed a “sensitive content” warning on the video, which was also posted to Gosar’s official account on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uy3Qfs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gosar’s video is just the latest example of a long-standing interest in the meme culture that’s popular in far-right internet communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kCHvMw"&gt;Democratic lawmakers are already demanding that Gosar face additional consequences for the video. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called on McCarthy to “join in condemning this horrific video and call on the Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1458105886182887424?s=20"&gt;in a Tuesday tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXj2uN"&gt;White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said at a press conference Tuesday, “This should not be happening, and we should be condemning it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxbdT4"&gt;As of Wednesday afternoon, McCarthy has yet to respond to Pelosi’s statements or those from the White House. His office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the video and Gosar’s future standing in the Republican caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJOjzu"&gt;But Gosar’s video is just the latest example of a long-standing interest in the meme culture that’s popular in far-right internet communities and image boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynx7Jt"&gt;In October, Gosar tweeted a now-deleted meme video depicting the “Doomer guy,” a sad-looking cartoon image of a man, in front of a series of articles with some headlines related to transgender people. At the end of the video, the “America First” logo is displayed over Gosar’s head, a reference to a popular white nationalist movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwZ6cO"&gt;In August, he tweeted an image of himself in front of cacti, all with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-congressman-paul-gosar-is-tweeting-a-green-arrow-po-1847590910"&gt;green lines edited&lt;/a&gt; in a reference to a red-pill pro-masculinity meme. In 2019, Gosar’s account tweeted out a thread &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gop-rep-paul-gosar-inserts-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-1839844491"&gt;that spelled out “Epstein didn’t kill himself&lt;/a&gt;” with the first two letters in a series of 22 tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUUZPu"&gt;This kind of content espouses a kind of rhetoric more often found in image boards than the halls of Congress, experts say. “This is incredibly intentional work,” said Jamie Cohen, assistant professor in media studies at Queens College. “This is by design, and it is internet fluency that is not your typical internet fluency from a member of Congress. This is a far-right influence being broadcast over a public speaker because he’s a public figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eF8VYI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He’s getting very good at expanding the borderlands”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hO1cr2"&gt;Gosar’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding who created the videos published on his Twitter feed. But in a now-deleted quote-tweet from his personal account, Gosar thanked his “team” for their creativity in editing the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mu3Nk"&gt;Gosar’s digital director, Jessica Lycos, responded to the backlash in a statement on Monday, saying, “We made an anime video.” Lycos continued, “Everyone needs to relax. The left don’t get meme culture. They have no joy. They are not the future. It’s a cartoon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qTuAS"&gt;As pressure continued to mount on Gosar in response to the video, his office put out a lengthy statement Tuesday night calling the backlash a “gross mischaracterization” of a symbolized “battled for the soul of America when Congress takes up Mr. Biden’s $4 trillion spending bill that includes amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.” Gosar continued, “I do not espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfWkIh"&gt;But experts argue that Gosar’s flirtation with right-wing meme culture is still harmful, normalizing extreme content even as it stays within the bounds of what’s acceptable. “When we normalize this type of media, we extend to the outward edges of what can be presented online,” Cohen said. “If he’s not held accountable, the next thing will be edgier and become acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMYcHl"&gt;“He’s getting very good at expanding the borderlands,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmsPBe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will now show full-sized images on web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMlgNu_hqlEB2J5b4rb8S56Iyw4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124780/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ojFiAY"&gt;Twitter is dropping the crop on web. This is the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;update that banished&lt;/a&gt; Twitter’s awkward auto-cropping algorithm on its Android and iOS apps, which means that you’ll see images in their entirety on your timeline as you scroll through Twitter on your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PEUj8e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is now available on web!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pic looking good in the Tweet composer? That’s how it will look on the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6flZ1K"&gt;The same goes for when you post images of your own; you’ll see an accurate preview of your image that doesn’t appear oddly formatted when you post it. The platform touts its full-size preview window as a “what you see is what you get” look at your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI2agv"&gt;The ongoing changes to Twitter’s handling of photos stem from last year’s auto-crop controversy. Some users noticed that Twitter’s auto-cropping algorithm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;may favor white faces over Black faces&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a crop that shows white faces more prominently. Twitter looked into the issue and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444372/twitter-image-crop-racial-gender-bias-research"&gt;found that its auto-crop algorithm wasn’t very biased&lt;/a&gt; but still disabled it just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlozGj"&gt;Whether Twitter’s auto-crop feature was biased or not, I think we can all agree that we’re better off now that it’s gone for good. This means we’ll no longer miss out on interesting images because we were too lazy to click past the preview. I still might miss the awkwardly cropped images, though (as long as they’re not my own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CUbGc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Withings’ ScanWatch with built-in EKG is finally available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m95Ko4cU73TYIfFzCcFUpe-OqXc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124625/akrales_200916_4186_0153.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsrznF"&gt;After almost two years, the Withings ScanWatch is now available to purchase in the US after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; back at the beginning of 2020. The ScanWatch was waiting for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722333/withings-fda-clearance-blood-oxygen-heart-rhythm"&gt;clearance from the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which it had received in October for its EKG and blood oxygen measurement features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8t9j6"&gt;Unlike its competitors Apple Watch and Fitbit, both of whom can track blood oxygen and have EKG technology, Withings is claiming that the hybrid watch can detect sleep apnea, a sleep disorder charactered by disrupted breathing patterns. The ScanWatch is still a part of an &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004508038-ScanWatch-Clinical-studies#anchor_apnea"&gt;ongoing clinical study&lt;/a&gt; for this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YekNB7"&gt;Unlike Apple and Fitbit’s devices, the Withings ScanWatch also requires medical review. Users are required to &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;gain medical clearance&lt;/a&gt; to fully access the EKG feature, Withings says. After 24 to 48 hours, users can access their first EKG reading in the HealthMate app that they can install on their connected phones. During that time, their readings are sent to Heartbeat Health, a healthcare technology company, where they will be consulted by a cardiology team for clinical interpretation, &lt;a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/heartbeat-health-partners-with-withings-on-new-fda-cleared-hybrid-21547475?_ga=2.113187140.1736918582.1636383180-2013823946.1636055945"&gt;according to the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. This feature is only available if you’re over 22 years old, and in some states, you may be required to give your phone number so &lt;a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-"&gt;Heartbeat Health can contact you directly about the results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CnS4FP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"REVIEW: THE WITHINGS SCANWATCH KNOWS YOU’RE SLEEPING AND WHEN YOU’RE AWAKE, BUT NOT WHY","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bDzqUU"&gt;That’s a lot of hoops to jump through for something Apple and Fitbit can effectively do with a tap — but it could be worth it if you want a smartwatch that looks more like a regular one. The Withings ScanWatch is available in both white or black and is priced starting at $279 for the 38mm and $299 for the 42mm. It is currently being sold on the Withings website, Amazon and Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb improves accessibility search filters for its accommodations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Travel Websites Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAuMADxe8doiDw9s-whsXNkNHGA=/79x0:3465x2257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122314/1234731223.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKYJic"&gt;Airbnb has updated its search filters and accessibility review process with the goal of making it easier for people with disabilities to find accommodations on its platform, the company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/accessibility-review/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnpyuM"&gt;Hosts can now submit pictures of the accessibility features in their homes, and “a specialized team of Airbnb agents” will review them to determine if they’re suitable for people with disabilities. On its &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Faccessibility&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accessibility review page&lt;/a&gt;, Airbnb says that this team works “with engineers, designers, and others across the company” but doesn’t specifically state whether they’re trained or how they’re qualified to recognize accessibility features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUjDx1"&gt;We reached out to Suzanne Edwards, Airbnb’s head of hosting accessibility standards, for a clearer answer. “Airbnb agents are trained based on a rigorous set of accessibility photo standards,” she explained. “For instance, for a Host to list an accessible parking spot — a private driveway at least 11 feet wide or a parking spot designated for a person with disabilities with clear signage — they must show the proximity of the parking spot to the guest entrance, as well as the signage or markings for a designated accessible space, or capture the entire driveway with a parked vehicle if possible to show its width.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SufLt9"&gt;Airbnb says its staff has already reviewed and approved 100,000 accessibility features in 25,000 different homes globally, which CEO Brian Chesky noted on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ERfJuE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Accessibility Review: &lt;br&gt;We’re reviewing every accessibility feature on Airbnb for accuracy. To date, our agents have double checked photos of features in more than 25,000 homes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CfDh808qGM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CfDh808qGM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1458109384144211972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rCcTxa"&gt;Airbnb also updated its search filters for accessibility features. Some filters, like ones for step-free bedroom access and accessible parking spaces, will now be shown more prominently on the search screen. Airbnb made filters pertaining to wide entryways slightly more specific by adding a more precise measurement. For example, instead of “wide entrance to bedroom,” Airbnb changed it to “bedroom entrance wider than 32 inches.” As it stands, these 13 filters are still fairly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrXEGT"&gt;Airbnb also announced that it’s making it easier to find accessible Experiences, improving its 11 accessibility filters to allow guests to find activities near their rental that offer features like sign language, provide access to accessible bathrooms, take place on a flat surface, and more. Airbnb is also requiring hosts to submit detailed information about the accessibility measures they’re taking, which then goes under review for “description quality.” Each Experience listing will also clearly show its available accessibility features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knKK7y"&gt;In 2017, a study found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15729326/airbnb-disability-discrimination-study"&gt;Airbnb hosts were more likely to reject guests with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17125452/airbnb-disabilities-accommodations-search-filter-travel"&gt;rolled out an accessibility update&lt;/a&gt; adding 21 filters that let guests search for homes with wider entrances, accessible bathrooms, and more. The number of filters has since dropped to 13, which is a bit strange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFydxP"&gt;Previous filters, like “wide clearance to bed,” “accessible height toilet,” and “handheld showerhead,” are now missing from the current list. An Airbnb spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company decided to simplify the list, stating: “To better serve our guests, and with input from our community and partners, we have updated the filters to make it easier for guests to find homes which suit their needs. One of those updates is simplifying to focus on essential and most used filters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl0I3z"&gt;Airbnb first started requiring hosts to upload photos of the accessibility features in their stays &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/introducing-new-ways-to-improve-accuracy-of-accessibility-information-for-guests/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been long overdue for an update. “We’ve continuously been working to improve our offerings with input from our community and with experts from the disability community, and we will continue to do so,” Edwards told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="I8DHQ5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Airbnb’s CEO thinks the platform can replace your landlord","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22453150/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-interview-host-rentals-long-term"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rdfYus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add statements from Suzanne Edwards and an Airbnb spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn buys Ohio electric vehicle factory once touted by Donald Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJWLys73Nn9rp3jW40m8e_ECAe0=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124419/1232963360.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AzaloN"&gt;Foxconn has officially agreed to buy the former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors, giving the iPhone assembler its first automotive factory and a second chance at establishing a manufacturing foothold in the United States. The Taiwanese conglomerate has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732897/foxconn-electric-vehicles-foxtron-platform-evs"&gt;spent the last year&lt;/a&gt; buying up or partnering with companies in the electric vehicle space in a massive effort to diversify away from laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBJZUD"&gt;The two companies &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/foxconn-and-lordstown-motors-enter-transformative-strategic"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that they’ve agreed to the framework deal first announced in September, meaning Foxconn will pay Lordstown Motors $230 million for the 6.2-million-square-foot factory. Foxconn has also agreed to contract manufacture Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck, the Endurance. The deal is expected to close by the end of April next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uk7cy"&gt;The startup bought the plant from GM in 2019 months after the leading US automaker had shuttered it — a decision that drew the ire of then-President Donald Trump. Trump pumped up Lordstown Motors’ effort to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;buy the factory in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;, saying in a tweet that it was “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” After that, Lordstown Motors became something of a darling of the Trump administration. It was invited to the White House for an event, and Mike Pence appeared at the event where the startup revealed the Endurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v8BpaS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lordstown Motors desperately needs the money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FfKRha"&gt;Lordstown Motors has struggled mightily since, though, despite raising nearly $700 million when it went public in late 2020. It is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;currently under investigation&lt;/a&gt; by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice after a short-selling research firm raised allegations of fraud. A number of executives have resigned, including president Rich Schmidt, which Lordstown Motors announced Wednesday morning. The startup had said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;earlier this year that it would run out of cash in May 2022&lt;/a&gt; without more funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6KlVS"&gt;The Ohio factory is the second location where Foxconn overlaps with Trump. The first was in Wisconsin, where Trump touted Foxconn’s planned LCD factory as the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;eighth wonder of the world&lt;/a&gt;.” The plans for that factory have been dramatically revised down in scope ever since, though, and Foxconn has done little more at the location than raze acres of land and put up some empty buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1QcXL"&gt;Lordstown Motors will continue to rent space in the Ohio factory, and it announced Wednesday that will work with Foxconn to develop vehicles on the Taiwanese conglomerate’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732897/foxconn-electric-vehicles-foxtron-platform-evs"&gt;new EV platform&lt;/a&gt;. Another EV startup, Fisker Inc., will use some space in the factory, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh0FOa"&gt;Lordstown Motors said earlier this year that it had already spent $240 million updating the factory to get it ready to build the Endurance. The startup will also get to keep its electric motor production line, as well as its battery module and pack assembly lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEdSSI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify now frustratingly defaults to autoplay for connected devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4jYR2BJ0t_Iw89idjxfFnAaiCUw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124377/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D0id8v"&gt;Spotify quietly updated its autoplay feature with a seriously frustrating quirk. When you play music on your Spotify Connect devices, autoplay is now enabled by default and there’s no way to turn it off. This means that after your album, playlist, or your song selection is done playing on any device other than your phone or computer, Spotify will continue playing recommended tracks indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhWM1F"&gt;Users have voiced their complaints in the Spotify Community forum for weeks, filling &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Podcasts-Partners-etc/Connect-Autoplay-DISABLED-but-still-ACTIVE/td-p/5279608/page/7"&gt;an ongoing thread&lt;/a&gt; with their grievances. It caught the attention of a Spotify Community moderator, who provided some more information about the issue — which is apparently a feature and &lt;em&gt;definitely not a bug&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qdgibM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can confirm that Autoplay is the default setting for any connected device”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w5A9dp"&gt;“We can confirm that Autoplay is the default setting for any connected device,” a Spotify spokesperson said in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This means that whenever you play music from Spotify on a device other than your phone or computer, Autoplay will be enabled, and tracks will be added to continue your listening experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZUf3j"&gt;However, the spokesperson says that “Autoplay will not commence if you play a track, album, or playlists with Repeat enabled.” That obviously doesn’t help if you want an album or playlist to end after it’s done playing. The spokesperson also mentioned that Spotify updated the experience “during the last couple of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdTXsN"&gt;In the aforementioned thread, the Spotify moderator suggested that users cast their votes in a post in &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/AutoPlay-Option-to-toggle-Autoplay-on-off-across-all-devices/idi-p/5283776"&gt;the Spotify Idea Exchange&lt;/a&gt; to show support for an option to toggle autoplay on and off, but the page that the moderator links to doesn’t address that exact issue. In the post’s description, the user asks for Spotify to bring back the settings menu on the Spotify web player that was recently removed, which prevents users from changing their autoplay options when listening from the web player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPtmPc"&gt;Other than the title of the post: “[AutoPlay] Option to toggle Autoplay on/off across all devices/platforms,” it doesn’t have much to do with the problem users were initially discussing, causing confusion in that entire thread — comments on the post concern both the settings menu and the problem with Spotify Connect. It’s unclear whether bringing back the settings menu on the web player will help resolve the autoplay issue on connected devices (or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7h0s8"&gt;When a post on the Spotify Idea Exchange receives over 180 votes in under six months, the suggestion gets the “Live Idea” label and will be looked at by the Spotify team. Right now, this so-called idea is currently a “Good Suggestion,” meaning it received more than 50 votes in under three months. The status should be upgraded soon, though, since it has a total of 259 votes at this time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHUOBN"&gt;It’s ironic that Spotify calls something that’s essentially a bug report an “idea.” After all, music on connected devices wasn’t set on an infinite loop too long ago. With Spotify projected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746682/spotify-q3-2021-earnings-podcast-music-streaming-financials"&gt;increase its user base from 381 million to 400 million&lt;/a&gt; users by the end of this year, it’s going to have a lot more users it needs to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDJW9D"&gt;“At Spotify, we’re committed to delivering the best possible listening experience. We recently updated our Autoplay settings for connected devices, and are actively gathering feedback from the Spotify Community,” the Spotify spokesperson continued&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;As always, we’ll continue to evolve this feature over time based on user feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify makes it easier to block other users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spotify Stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DVE5skyrgccPMuOSoLYgGTs8kw=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124224/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify has made it easier to block other users | Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBCbRU"&gt;Spotify is rolling out a new feature that will allow users to more easily block others on the platform. Previously, users had to contact customer support to block someone, but now the feature is easier to find on a user profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ug8D8g"&gt;To block a user, go to their Spotify profile. Under their username and photo, above their public playlists and next to the “follow” button, click the three dots menu and choose “block,” or on mobile, “block user.” Now that user won’t be able to access your listening activity, your page, or any public playlists. You also can unblock a user you’ve previously blocked at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O9U6IySRmrJ9mj4Wmn_9u_ktvMw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003482/block_spotify.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to block a user on Spotify.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KEETpk"&gt;“At Spotify, we’re committed to delivering the best possible listening experience to our users,” a company spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“Privacy is something that is, and always will be, enormously important to us and our block feature, which gives users more control, is the latest step towards that commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvV5XN"&gt;The company introduced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/21/18191332/spotify-block-feature-mute-artists-music"&gt;“block artist” feature in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but users have been asking for a way to block other users for the past several years. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/spotify-still-wont-enable-a-feature-that-would-let-its"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; did an in-depth report on Spotify users&lt;/a&gt; who were stalked and harassed by other users but who were unable to prevent the harassers from viewing their activity on the platform. &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Social-Block-Followers/idi-p/310496/page/53"&gt;At the time, Spotify said&lt;/a&gt; it was putting the introduction of a block user capability “under consideration.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHJb1d"&gt;Spotify says the change should be available to users this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgkyaX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhwMOR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0tsZl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxdmn/robinhood-hackers-internal-tool-security-features?utm_source=motherboard_twitter"&gt;Screenshots obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reportedly show the internal Robinhood tools that a hacker used to access “more extensive account details” for some of the trading platform’s accounts. The heavily redacted screenshots show that hackers had access to buttons labeled “Disable MFA” (multi-factor authentication) and “Add to Trusted Device Email Code Whitelist,” along with information about what devices were logged into the account, and the ACH bank transfers the user had done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVKn04"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; says it got the screenshots from someone claiming to be affiliated with the hackers. Robinhood told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its investigation didn’t reveal evidence that the hacker made any changes to accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wP8wEQW--qftTk8XMNDu6QW5sYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003306/1636570231635_robintopublish.png"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;One of the screenshots reportedly provided by the Robinhood hackers. Redactions were made by &lt;/em&gt;Motherboard&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xfuqc1"&gt;Although data was accessed for around 7 million people, Robinhood said &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;in its announcement&lt;/a&gt; that most of them only had their email addresses or full names obtained. Ten people, however, had “more extensive account details revealed.” Robinhood confirmed the account included in one screenshot &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; received showing a customer support conversation was one of those 10. Another screenshot also shows a customer’s account balance, portfolio value, and verified phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn60b5"&gt;Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770861/robinhood-7-million-customers-hacker-breach-extortion-security"&gt;announced the hack on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, saying that someone was able to socially engineer one of its support employees and gain access to some of the company’s customer support tools. These tools gave them access to some user information, though not Social Security, bank, or debit card numbers, according to Robinhood. The company won’t say if the users who had more data accessed than others were specifically targeted, but it has said that it’s reaching out to those affected. Robinhood also said that the hacker tried to extort it for money, but that it didn’t pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjgbHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 5:16PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information from Robinhood stating the hackers did not alter account information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elden Ring hands-on: an open world so pretty you won’t mind dying a lot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xt-db1CboZpev4HmsRC7TqtcodA=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124038/elden_ring_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Let me climb the tree, Elden Ring&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="bLIE0D"&gt;My journey through the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; closed network preview started in a dark cave. Instead of following the obvious path out of the cave in front of me, I veered toward what looked to be a bottomless cliff on my right, just to see what I could see. It wasn’t bottomless; instead I could see flickering light at what was likely a fatal distance below. But before my logical brain could remind me, “There’s fall damage in &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt; games, you know,” my curious squirrel brain propelled me over the cliff where I landed undamaged. I let out a surprised and delighted little squeak and was on my way. That was my main source of excitement from &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring, &lt;/em&gt;after playing for 10-ish hours. The Lands Between are peppered with so many nooks and crannies begging to be discovered that it’s possible to have a radically different experience each time you play. I lent part of my playtime to my &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt;-loving partner and our two playthroughs were so different, it was like we played two different games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmgwz0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; looks like FromSoftware decided to ditch the unique conventions of &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt; to return to the &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; formula that made the studio famous. The UI is virtually indistinguishable from &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/em&gt;. You’ve got quick items in four quadrants in the bottom left of your screen, the number of runes (&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;’s level-up currency) in the  bottom right, and your health, stamina, and focus (mana) bars in the top left. When you beat a boss, the world darkens as golden letters appear letting you know, “Foe Defeated.” If you’re familiar with FromSoftware games, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; will look like the bones of a &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; game in a much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; prettier skin suit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/85IesPDJO55Nx-EtW7fFRkAP26A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003207/elden_ring_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ahM9Sb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; feels warmer than &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, the color palette reminding me of the last rays of sunlight right before a torrential rain. It’s not a sunny game although there are day and night cycles, but the bright yellows, shiny golds, and lush greens make it feel lighter and more hopeful than previous FromSoftware titles. You play a Tarnished, which sounds unsavory, but instead of feeling like the foul and corrupted damned as I did in &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, I am pretty damn confident about my chances of finding the shards of the titular Elden Ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08oCpm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; adds a lot of quality-of-life improvements not typical to &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt; games. The sites of grace that heal you also guide you where to go in case the open world gets too overwhelming. An expansive map system lets you mark important places like the location of merchants or roaming bosses to avoid. You can find or buy items that let you summon spirits that help you kill enemies or distract bosses. And when you die, you can choose to resurrect at the last site of grace you activated or a special statue you’ve passed, potentially saving you from an arduous re-tread through a difficult area. But for all these conveniences, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; isn’t an easier &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt;-experience. You’re gonna get the crap kicked out of you — a lot. But the game seems to want to make your experience a little less frustrating when you inevitably do have the tar beaten out of you multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7gXmbH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re gonna get the crap kicked out of you — a lot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFkBBn"&gt;For my&lt;em&gt; Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; adventure, I chose the magic-focused prophet class. In addition to a healing spell and a weapon spell that grants you healing and armor while you’re within its range, you also start with the Beast Claw spell that pretty much one-shots everything not a boss but takes so long to wind up, you’ll die before it strikes. I’m sure I could have probably done more to enhance my survivability by wearing better armor or using better spells, but I was in love with the spell and determined to make it work despite its fatal weakness. That openness is what hooked me on &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;. It plops you into a beautiful, open world giving you a blank canvas of a class and says, “Okay, make it work.” So I did, concocting an elaborate dodging and weaving strategy that would hopefully preserve my life while ensuring the spell hit home. I beat a couple of bosses that way, and those I couldn’t beat, I just found somewhere else to explore instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpWtn7"&gt;My favorite location was a dungeon composed of a network of catacombs. It was filled with fire traps that killed me unless I was at full health and quick little bastard enemies that clung to the walls unseen and fell on top of me, ripping me apart with unfathomably fast strikes. Misjudge the distance to a gout of flame? Death. Fail to check your corners like a soldier breaching a compound? Death. Yet, despite losing a dragon’s hoard of 1,300 runes and screaming so loud my dog thought I was dying,&lt;em&gt; Elden Ring,&lt;/em&gt; with its freedom of exploration, made death feel like a puzzle to solve and not a punishment for carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRYp5TluL409e6Y170HzgeJbNTk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003209/elden_ring_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s6330K"&gt;At the first site of grace I found after beating the boss at the end of my not-bottomless-pit dungeon, I was greeted by a snickering shithead who told me I was better off dying in a ditch because I was “maidenless.” After leaving him and his condescension behind, I wandered The Lands Between, dodging a heavily armored mounted asshole and sucking up runes from tiny, woodland creatures and sheep who have the awesome ability to curl up and roll away a la Samus’ Morph Ball. I found a second site of grace and after activating it, a tattooed woman named Melina greeted me, offering an accord. She pledged to be my maiden, the level-up lady FromSoftware games are fond of, and gave me Torrent, a spirit horse, to help me navigate the vast Lands Between. After spending time with Torrent, gleefully mowing down enemies with my Beast Claw from horseback which I was surprised and delighted to find the game allowed me to do, I returned to the snickering shithead, no longer maidenless, and dueled him to death. Felt good, righteous even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhTV0w"&gt;After spending several hours with &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, the thought my mind returns to, long after the closed network test session ended is, “Can I climb the golden tree?” I never got close to those trees. I survived a fall through a deadly chasm, rode a ghost horse into battle, and got some good old-fashioned revenge — but I never got close to those trees. They tower above the open, expansive landscape, glowing a pretty yellow gold and calling to me to scale their many branches like a beacon. This is &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, a FromSoftware game in which the appeal ostensibly lies in beating punishing enemies and boss fights. But, when presented with such a beautiful, melancholic open world and a trusty, double-jumping spirit horse to navigate it all, all I want to do is climb the tree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv7pca"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; launches on PlayStation and Xbox February 25th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will soon let you pass on your iCloud data when you die </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBZI9ivVRiNFnV9ZrEB2Al6OUiE=/375x0:4422x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123890/Claim_Request___iPad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Digital Legacy program lets users choose up to five people who can access their iCloud account when they pass away.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xZ0p1D"&gt;Apple is solving a complicated problem with its latest iOS update: right of survivorship. Until now, when a loved one or family member dies, there was no easy way to access their iCloud account and absolutely no way of unlocking their phone without knowing their passcode. According to the&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html"&gt; iCloud terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, the deceased person’s data goes with them even with a death certificate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0yJO5"&gt;With the new Digital Legacy program, first announced at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_0TD96VTf0Xs-3Ft-3D3250&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=HTakECkqD13F_4No8TePr7snOg-TM_Z0bAqwspVK1Ig&amp;amp;m=fItzX2rODQv7RTBNSewxVHMkya7KOGU1oXhxAzEMZPr6hl7x3l__BXbSpMvo-Oet&amp;amp;s=C1TZjvKT6GLXL0Ujl0iCXyP3v_KcOvP9Mlxi4sdZ8NY&amp;amp;e="&gt;WWDC earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and arriving in iOS 15.2, you can designate up to five people as Legacy Contacts. These individuals can then access your data and personal information stored in iCloud when you die, such as photos, documents, and even purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTcY2F"&gt;To activate Digital Legacy, Apple still requires proof of death and an access key. Still, it’s a much more simplified process than before, which could require a court order confirming a right to inheritance, and even then, there was no guarantee you would get access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsBjJm"&gt;This has been a complicated situation for Apple, which has long touted its core principles of protecting users’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/01/technology/leonardo-fabbretti-apple/index.html"&gt;Grieving parents&lt;/a&gt; and spouses railing against the company for not giving them access to their spouses’ photos isn’t a good look. But neither is doling out people’s data willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OicCfd"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/991335594313139"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have systems in place for designating account access to other people, and it’s good to see Apple catching up here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/940cfO0OkQ_5sDIpdxvW-ApWX20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003129/Legacy_Contact_Setup___iPhone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set up your Legacy Contacts in Settings on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="cGLS0b"&gt;How to set up a Legacy Contact &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4J6udT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(note you need to be running iOS 15.2 to access this feature)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QNxQyr"&gt;On an iOS device, go to Settings &amp;gt; [your name] &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mLmW5J"&gt;On a Mac, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oIRNAU"&gt;Under Legacy Contact, follow the instructions to add a Legacy Contact. If you use Family Sharing, you can choose a family member from the list; alternatively, add someone using their email or phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CD5ZzW"&gt;Notify your Legacy Contact and share an access key via Messages. If they accept, a copy of the access key is automatically stored in their Apple ID settings. If they decline, you will receive a notification. The access key is required to get into your account if you pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PRSBZY"&gt;While you can add a Legacy Contact who isn’t on iOS 15.2, they won’t be able to store the access key in the settings on their device, so you should provide it to them in another way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uspE8A"&gt;Legacy Contact is part of the Digital Legacy program and is available now in the public beta version of iOS 15.2 for iPhone. It will be broadly accessible when iOS 15.2 fully launches. Apple hasn’t said which version of macOS will support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltlITw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
