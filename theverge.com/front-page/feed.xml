  &lt;p&gt;The mind behind Summer Wars and Mirai discusses his latest anime feature  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="P5RtlP"&gt;When I sat down to chat with director Mamoru Hosoda over Zoom last November, it had only been a few weeks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;since Facebook had announced its name change&lt;/a&gt;, and everyone seemed to be talking about the metaverse. Hosoda, meanwhile, was promoting his latest film: &lt;em&gt;Belle&lt;/em&gt;, a modern reinterpretation of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; that just so happened to be set in a metaverse-like virtual world. “I certainly didn’t expect Facebook to change their name during our promotional campaign,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0E2RN"&gt;Hosoda is perhaps best known for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/29/18117959/mirai-review-mamoru-hosoda-girl-who-leapt-through-time"&gt;his 2018 anime &lt;em&gt;Mirai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was nominated for best animated picture at the Academy Awards. But he’s also been exploring the idea of virtual worlds for quite some time. He got his start directing with a pair of &lt;em&gt;Digimon&lt;/em&gt; movies, and in 2009 he released &lt;em&gt;Summer Wars&lt;/em&gt;, in which a rogue AI wreaks havoc on a virtual world. “That dynamism and excitement that surrounds this idea of the internet really caught me,” he says of his initial attraction to the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDFNDU"&gt;The internet has become virtually unrecognizable in the two decades since &lt;em&gt;Digimon Adventure&lt;/em&gt; debuted, and that’s evident in &lt;em&gt;Belle. &lt;/em&gt;The film&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;uses its classic inspiration as a way of exploring the dual lives people often live online, starring a shy young girl from a small village who becomes a world-famous singer inside of a sprawling virtual space known as U. (In a meta twist, you can follow her avatar &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/uworld_belle/"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2P6Rq"&gt;It’s a clever take on &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; — there’s also a mysterious, monstrous figure who is more than they seem — but more than that, &lt;em&gt;Belle&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant story about our always-online culture, tackling difficult subjects like cyberbullying. And for Hosoda it was a chance not only to update a fairy tale he long admired, but also to update his vision of what a global virtual world might one day look like. U is an almost overwhelming space filled with skyscrapers and the avatars of a staggering 5 billion users, which has become the kind of virtual town square that Jack Dorsey could only dream of. Think of it like Times Square crossed with a round of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; and you’re almost there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajk0d2"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Belle&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters in the US this week, here’s my conversation with Hosoda about the movie, the evolution of his ideas about the internet, designing the virtual realm U, and where the metaverse might go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="usjHkt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t your first time tackling these subjects and themes. What is it that keeps you coming back to stories about virtual worlds and the internet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru13t8"&gt;I recall creating movies that have to do with the theme of the internet all the way back to about 2000, with &lt;em&gt;Digimon Adventure: Our War Game&lt;/em&gt;. And I was fascinated by this idea that something aside from our own reality, these big events or phenomena that occur in this space can in some way, shape, or form affect our reality as we understand it. At the time the internet seemed like this very young space that was for a younger generation, and I felt like it had this almost hope of younger kids breaking these old values that we had and creating a new world. That dynamism and excitement that surrounds this idea of the internet really caught me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMQEqe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot has happened in the last 20 years with the way the internet functions, and a lot of these things that were science fiction then are now becoming reality. How have your feelings about the space changed? Do you have the same sense of optimism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDHwgi"&gt;Certainly the internet has changed massively in the last 20 years. One of the biggest changes, or shifts, I believe is this idea that we all interact with the internet in some way. Regardless of your age group or demographic, the internet affects your life. Because of that, our reality, and this other reality that exists in the internet world, have become much closer in the last 20 years than it was when the internet was much younger. We’ve carried a lot of our issues into the internet space; the toxicity, a lot of negativity. Because of that a lot of parents say, “Well the internet is bad” and they might take their kid’s iPad away and say, “We don’t want you on the internet.” But it’s not necessarily the internet that’s bad, I believe, it’s some of the more negative sides of us as a species that has manifested itself in this space. The issue isn’t so much the internet but us as humans, and how this anonymity changes us and changes behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4G1Am"&gt;But in spite of this, I think some elements of the internet remain unchanged, and this idea that the younger generation is always going to find a new way to take advantage of it to innovate and push the status quo further. I think there’s still some hope there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvsA8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, what was the starting point? Did you want to explore this topic again and the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beauty and the Beast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;story fit well, or did you start with reinterpreting the story and this metaverse concept came from there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3d85v"&gt;I always admired the story of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, even when I was much younger. So I would say the idea of reinterpreting &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; came first. What really fascinated me about this story is how the values seemed to be inverted in some ways; what we think is pretty turns out to be ugly, and what might look ugly turns out to be quite beautiful on the inside. I’ve wanted to make my interpretation of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; for 30 years now. It took me 30 years to do it, but we’re finally here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fxZGu"&gt;In terms of how to tell that narrative, I realized this idea of the internet really worked well with the concept of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; in that they both share this duality in some sense. In &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, the beast obviously has this very vicious and violent-looking exterior, but what’s inside is quite different. In a similar way, with the invention of the internet, we as people have the version of ourselves that exists in reality and another projection that exists in the internet. So there’s a similar duality happening, and I thought that would allow the narrative, and a lot of those themes, to work and come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ffHybL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0tORZayURs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="REieFA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what was the hold up? Was it just finding the right way to tell this story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36mVbV"&gt;In some of my past works, I did try to explore certain concepts from &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, but this is the first time I really consciously took it to this level and said, “This is a direct inspiration.” Take, for example, &lt;em&gt;Wolf Children&lt;/em&gt;, where we have a wolf man falling in love with a woman, or more recently &lt;em&gt;Boy and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, which is sort of like a &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; story told through a father and son. I think there have been a few iterations in my filmography where I try to explore the issue, but I would say this is the first time I really went for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWpsVL"&gt;Another reason why it took 30 years is that a lot of the shifts that happened around us in the world — we can go back to Disney’s interpretation from 30 years ago, or trace it back even further to 1946 when Jean Cocteau did his interpretation, or back even further to the original works — there have been a lot of changes in our society, and I felt the interpretation had to be similarly updated for a different audience and a different social context. The definition of beauty for me seemed much different if you trace it back to the original work, which was a very specific idea of beauty and a very male-dominated perspective. There seemed to be only a few ways that women could check all of the boxes of what it meant to be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnUcDU"&gt;In Disney’s version 30 years ago, I think they really explored the idea of the duality of the beast. But today, I think that duality goes further and applies very much to this concept of beauty where the protagonist has to overcome certain obstacles to gain strength and almost feed strength to herself, and in many ways the way that she exerts this strength is in and of itself a very beautiful sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqrEds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With U, the virtual world in the movie, what was it like figuring out how that would look and function? Were you aiming for something that felt plausible, that viewers could relate to with all of the tech they use in their lives, or were you going for something more futuristic and sci-fi?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99osJW"&gt;In the last 20 years, I think the internet has certainly changed a lot, and if you look at some of my earlier movies — &lt;em&gt;Digimon&lt;/em&gt; in 2000 and &lt;em&gt;Summer Wars&lt;/em&gt; in 2009 — when trying to visually express what’s inside this concept of the internet, I chose a much more white backdrop with a lot of colors that popped. It felt very inviting, it felt very vast and incomplete, like it was the frontier. A blank canvas, if you will. It wasn’t a space just for boys, it was open to women, younger generations, anyone who had something to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHAxRT"&gt;But, as we talked about before, the internet has shifted quite a bit and become much closer to reality. So when thinking about how to express that, capture that in a visual medium, we ended up with what you see in U, which is this space that doesn’t necessarily have an up or a down, a left or a right. It’s packed with these skyscraper-like structures. It feels a little more cramped. Not quite as open as it did in my previous films. It really feels like the center of this world, and it’s hard to tell where the horizon starts and where it ends. That was the visual translation of what I felt the internet has evolved into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVTwQo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that how you feel when you go on the internet? Just overwhelmed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGlyvN"&gt;I perhaps don’t feel as excited as I did once upon a time, when I’d go on the internet to search for something and there was this sense of discovery or finding something new that I haven’t felt in a long time. It certainly has lost that sense of being a frontier, or this really vast open space, though perhaps the metaverse will fill that void and become the new frontier. I do feel a little sorry for the younger generations because it is unfortunate that there isn’t as much of a frontier, and there needs to be some kind of revolution, I suppose, in the internet space for these generations to continue to push innovation and the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Belle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGdY6P2NdChz0dGAcU8J_zZQ7DQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144277/BELLE_Image04.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GKIDS&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fBm2wO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you look at these metaverses or virtual worlds — the ones that exist now or the ones that companies are talking about building in the future — they’re always very commercially driven. They’re plastered with ads and things to buy. There’s not a lot of that in U, aside from some mentions of sponsorship. I’m curious if that was intentional, and why you decided to go in that direction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okinqm"&gt;The internet is in many ways this new global world, and I think it is a representation of what a global world might look like, where languages and borders don’t play as much of a role anymore. U is intended to really capture that sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3oPS9"&gt;But in some ways this idea of a true globalized internet space, I question if it’s really possible, and that ties into the commercialism of it. Right now, the internet is really heavily influenced by Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, the mega-corporations. They are global corporations in many ways, but at the same time they are very much Western, or US-based, companies that are managing what direction the internet is going. I do believe that we need some kind of entity or space or reality that can transcend the needs of the corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F94hbE"&gt;Even in U, the social media icons were part of this new U-verse. The various social media networks or corporations are then part of this platform, not the ones creating it. I do believe that leap needs to happen for us to have this globalized world that we envision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpK54d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has it been like promoting this movie about a global, virtual world and seeing all of those companies you just talked about saying, “We want to build one of our own”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3fz7OZ"&gt;I certainly didn’t expect Facebook to change their name during our promotional campaign. In some ways, I was trying to depict something that was slightly in the distance, but what seemed like fiction is very much becoming a reality. That shift is certainly quite interesting that it’s happening in real time, as this movie is propagating throughout the world. I think there is still a little ways to go in order to immerse yourself in a world without VR glasses, there’s still a bit of a gap, but I think the future seems to be headed in that direction. Perhaps a lot of the issues that were raised in the movie will come into play as we continue to make this transition. So hopefully it will speak to the audience in that way as we move into the next phase of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFVZMo"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Belle &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be screening in select IMAX theaters in the US on January 12th, before opening up more widely on January 14th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know about 2022’s biggest chips from CES (and elsewhere)  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA-qOvlIZpUM9jZivpdTDrd-cLY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374177/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yd7xYj"&gt;It’s a new year, and like clockwork, 2022 has brought with it a plethora of new chips for laptops, desktops, phones, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEs5sx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;Intel announced new CPUs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866533/intel-12th-gen-cpu-alder-lake-mainstream-consumer-desktops-ces-2022"&gt;virtually every product it makes&lt;/a&gt;, AMD refreshed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;laptop processors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; for its whole lineup &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; started teasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856151/amd-ryzen-7000-desktop-cpu-5nm-next-gen-zen-4-release-date-ces-2022"&gt;its next major desktop overhaul&lt;/a&gt;, and Nvidia came out swinging with the announcement of its most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;powerful GPU yet&lt;/a&gt;. If you weren’t keeping up (or even if you were) it was a &lt;em&gt;lot.&lt;/em&gt; And that was just CES: Qualcomm already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;announced &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next-gen chips&lt;/a&gt; for smartphones and laptops in December, and Samsung is teeing up a new Exynos processor, too. And that’s not even considering Apple, which tends to play its cards closer to its chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWkn4I"&gt;But as the dust settles and products with that plethora of processors start to loom on the horizon, here’s a breakdown of 2022’s most important chips, and what they’ll mean when you’re looking for a new laptop, computer, or phone this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WBK3tc"&gt;Laptops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZOC9y"&gt;2022 is shaping up to be a very interesting year for new laptops, thanks to AMD and Intel — both of which announced full slates of new laptop chips at CES 2022, which will likely power almost any major computer released this year that doesn’t have an Apple logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="392Zcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of new laptop hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wWZNLm"&gt;Intel’s updates appear to be the more notable of the two companies, with the announcement of its Alder Lake family of chips for its entire laptop range (although only the most powerful H-series chips made their formal debut; the U-series and P-series lineups for lighter-weight laptops are set to arrive later in 2022). Like last year’s Alder Lake desktop chips, the new laptop chips are the first to feature Intel’s new (some might say Arm-esque) architecture with a mix of performance and efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZoUXLvvbEWktQCn47-4fD92mQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142901/12th_gen_mobile_chip_pose_06_4000px.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eSEIB2"&gt;The first wave of Alder Lake desktop processors were &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; impressive, a breakthrough product for an Intel that had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo"&gt;been caught in a yearslong slump of delays&lt;/a&gt; for its 10nm process (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;since renamed Intel 7&lt;/a&gt;). If Intel can realize similar success on its laptop lineup, Alder Lake could be the edge the company needs to fend off an ascendant AMD and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8CJwX"&gt;Processors are only a piece of the puzzle, though, and Intel’s biggest product of 2022 was still largely missing from CES 2022: its upcoming lineup of discrete Arc GPUs, which will be rolling out later this year for desktop &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;laptop devices. The company has already started teasing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865560/intel-arc-gpu-teaser-alchemist-ces-2022-oem"&gt;major partners like Dell, HP, and Samsung&lt;/a&gt; will be using its chips (in addition to adding the requirement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856046/intel-evo-laptop-standard-foldable-laptops-h-series-project-athena-ces-2022"&gt;Intel Evo-branded laptops&lt;/a&gt; with discrete GPUs will need to be using Arc chips to get Intel’s seal of approval). And Intel is making big promises about the potential of combining its integrated graphics in conjunction with discrete Arc GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/adaptix/deep-link.html"&gt;through its Deep Link technology&lt;/a&gt; for bigger gains. But for now, Arc is still one of the biggest question marks for 2022’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaRkIf"&gt;On the other side of the aisle are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;AMD’s new Ryzen 6000 chips&lt;/a&gt; for its laptops. This year’s chips still are using a slightly upgraded architecture from last year’s Ryzen 5000 (AMD calls its Zen 3 Plus and called out a few improvements like bumps to performance and battery life). That’s fine, given that last year’s Ryzen chips were already great —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt; AMD’s 2021 laptops were its first truly premium designs in ages&lt;/a&gt;, with great battery life, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;excellent performance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;powerful discrete GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RG-699T4XpCmshx07FoajVAvCDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160565/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_9.03.17_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIzmAa"&gt;The integrated GPU side of things, though, is where this year’s biggest changes are for AMD, which is finally upgrading to its new RDNA 2 architecture here instead of continuing to use its old Vega GPU designs. RDNA 2 is the same architecture that the PS5 and Xbox Series X have, and while the integrated GPUs on 2022 AMD laptops won’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; approach the power of those consoles, they’re even closer (with the top Radeon RX 6850M XT GPU actually offering more compute units than the PS5 does). All told, AMD is promising some big boosts for gaming on laptops, which is an exciting prospect… if the chips actually hold up to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DDKUDN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD has some big gaming updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9jtJYV"&gt;And for those who need more power, AMD also has a slate of new notebook GPUs, expanding its lower-end range for its 6000M series chips. It’s also introducing a new, more power-efficient line of Radeon 6000S chips for thinner and lighter laptops that — in theory — won’t have to compromise on gaming performance. Both of those lineups will be based on RDNA 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Nr1FZ"&gt;Lastly, there’s Nvidia, which announced a refreshed wave of powerful laptop GPUs that are coming soon: mobile versions of the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti, which promise 1440p gaming at 100 and 120 frames per second and can integrate with a laptop’s CPU to balance power and temperature for maximum performance. Nvidia tells us they’re roughly 10-20 percent more powerful than their non-Ti laptop predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmhmdp6umSn-6Sp_vSd5gNaW7vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144576/chrome_MtQmNzsoUF.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpKkNV"&gt;All said, it’s an exciting time to be looking to buy a new laptop in the coming weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLbYKa"&gt;Of course, all that goes without acknowledging the elephant in the room: Apple, which has not so quietly been establishing itself as a silicon force to be reckoned with thanks to its excellent M1 series of processors. (They recently received high-powered upgrades in the company’s late 2021 MacBook Pros — resulting in some of the best performance and battery life on any computer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever tested.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmTDnB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm will probably have to wait until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTNRI3"&gt;Qualcomm is also trying again to make inroads with laptops, a market that the company (which thoroughly dominates mobile SoCs) has yet to really break into in any meaningful way. This year, the company has its new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chipset, which the company says offers an 85 percent jump in CPU performance and a 60 percent faster GPU compared to Qualcomm’s previous laptop chip. That said, the new platform is off to a slow start: CES 2022 came and went without a single device announced using the 8cx Gen 3, and Qualcomm itself seems to be pinning its future not on its current flagship laptop chip, but a 2023 chip designed by the Nuvia team that will “set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBXVa"&gt;While Apple didn’t make an appearance at CES 2022, the shadow of its chips were definitely felt: Intel defiantly rolled out slides of benchmarks claiming its new Alder Lake H-series chips were even more powerful than Cupertino’s best — something that we’ll have to test for ourselves when 2022’s new crop of laptops roll around. Battery life on Intel’s chips is also a big question mark, one that the company didn’t really address in its announcements. Nvidia also took a shot at Apple, arguing that its new RTX Studio-branded computers with its new GPUs can offer seven times the GPU performance as Apple’s M1 Max. But Apple itself is rumored to have its second-generation processors out later this year, which could throw 2022’s chip crown into contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bB4Rcr"&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UHmEEY"&gt;The desktop side of things was a little calmer at CES 2022. Intel caught up the rest of its desktop lineup to Alder Lake, as well (last year’s launch was just a trio of high-powered gaming chips). The new lineup should bring Intel’s new architecture strategy (which has two types of processor cores) to the rest of its desktops, including more consumer-friendly desktop towers and all-in-one PCs. The company also rolled out new, cheaper motherboard designs to go with the broader release of chips (which were badly needed, given that until now there was just a single high-end chipset available). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE3ADt"&gt;AMD (which hasn’t updated its desktop lineup since late 2020) only announced a single new chip coming in the first half of the year: Ryzen 7 5800X3D, which uses AMD’s 3D V-Cache stacking technology to squeak out an extra 15 percent of power compared to the Ryzen 5900X. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hqEZvMf4RISZQ6DQob6ZI5lwBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144140/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.02.34_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvFlJm"&gt;More exciting things are on the horizon for later in 2022, though, even if there’s going to be a bit of a wait to get them. AMD has started its next big processor refresh with the Ryzen 7000 line of chips, which will be powered by the company’s new Zen 4 architecture, jump to a 5nm process node, and add a new socket. The chips will switch to AMD’s new AM5 design, which puts pins on the motherboard instead of the CPUs. That means that for the first time in over five years, you’ll have to get a new motherboard to take advantage of AMD’s new CPUs. Those chips won’t arrive until the second half of the year, but they should make a pretty big splash when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJoeCr"&gt;Nvidia also showed off its upcoming RTX 3090 Ti, which will take the crown as the company’s most powerful consumer graphics card when it arrives later this year (with a presumably sky-high price tag to match its performance).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1NA3pSU803m-Z4iGtlydXb4VJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144510/rtx3090Ti.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fMlJhI"&gt;Similar to the laptop side of things, 2022’s most mysterious chip product is Intel’s upcoming Arc discrete GPUs. Codenamed “Alchemist,” Intel will finally look to take on AMD and Nvidia directly for the minds, hearts, and GPU slots of gamers and creatives alike when it launches its extremely hyped consumer graphics cards later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkYSih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arc is inbound&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okM4gJ"&gt;Intel has already showed off some interesting demos, like its XeSS super-sampling for 4K scaling (similar to Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution). But the real test will come when the first GPUs actually ship. The current crop of rumors expect that Intel will be targeting the middle of the road for its first generation of GPUs (one leak from last fall &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/intel-arc-alchemist-gpu-could-be-a-game-changer-heres-everything-we-know"&gt;expects Intel’s best first-gen card&lt;/a&gt; to be competitive with about an RTX 3070), but we’ll have to wait for later this year when customers can see for themselves just how well Intel’s first major discrete GPUs in history really hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnEdiD"&gt;Lastly, there’s Apple, which is rumored to be expanding its Arm-based chips to the rest of its desktop lineup in 2022, where some of its most intriguing products have yet to be updated, like its high-powered Mac Pro desktop. It’ll be interesting to see how Apple manages to scale up its chip designs to that level of power and performance — especially with the fierce competition from AMD and Intel’s refreshed lineups mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JyMcHD"&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrpY7"&gt;Things are a little simpler when it comes to mobile chips. If you’re buying an Android phone in the US, odds are it’ll have a Qualcomm chip powering it. If it’s a flagship device, it’ll be the recently announced Qualcomm 8 Gen 1, the company’s latest and greatest SoC that’s expected to start showing up in products like Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cx9ECELaIfVlFXwfXgJGcLFNL0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053632/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="26x4vd"&gt;Apple will use whatever it names the next iteration of its A-series chips for the iPhone (the same money is on the A16), but it’ll be exclusively in Apple products. Samsung has its new Exynos 2200 processor, which will mix things up a bit with an AMD RDNA 2-powered GPU, but odds are it won’t ever make it to the US for a variety of licensing and modem issues (along with the simple fact that Qualcomm’s chips historically perform better than Samsung’s).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXs3W"&gt;Google is a company to watch, with its new Tensor SoC platform that it debuted on the Pixel 6 lineup last year; presumably, Google will be looking to follow that up with a second-generation version to power its 2022 smartphones. The company is rumored to be working on more powerful in-house chips for future Chromebooks, too — which could be extremely interesting in a world where Apple’s similarly custom-designed Arm-based laptops are some of the best computers around. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monster Hunter Rise is better on PC, but something’s missing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H25x2umws8XYOgrTumrLs_evJXo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374104/MHRISE_PC___Magnamalo_03_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7hN0Lq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; was one of the best games of 2021, taking almost all of the improvements Capcom made to its famously punishing action RPG series with &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt; and bringing them to an even breezier package on the Nintendo Switch. The series only took off in popularity with its portable entries on the PSP, so this new title tailored just for the Switch felt right at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijXjwo"&gt;That said, if you were used to &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; was a noticeable technical step back. It’s one of the best-looking games on the Switch, but it’s still a game on the Switch — it runs on a TV at roughly 720p and 30 frames a second, and the environmental design is much simpler than in &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJ0yRS"&gt;That’s why I was interested to check out the PC version of the game, which is releasing this week. How would &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; play when liberated from the Switch’s limited hardware? The news is mostly good on that front, but in another way the port represents a missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsM26MrKZ2ZISS4ouIKKS5u6GFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160523/MHRISE_PC___Filters_Screen_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lYMwuT"&gt;Capcom’s PC ports tend to be pretty good, in my experience — though I didn’t play last year’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; on PC, which I know quite a few people had issues with — and &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; is another solid example. There’s a fairly detailed list of advanced graphical settings to tweak, and the game works great on an ultrawide monitor, though cutscenes are still 16:9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EnMp0"&gt;I didn’t find myself diving into the menus too much, because &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; runs on its highest settings at 60fps and beyond at 3440 x 1440 ultrawide resolution with my GTX 1080. Sure, it’s a Switch game, but my PC is nearly six years old, so I’m used to putting in work to optimize performance. While some PC ports — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839361/final-fantasy-7-remake-pc-review-epic-game-store"&gt;looking at you, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — require much more powerful hardware than their original consoles to run well (and even then might have issues), I think &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; should be fine on most fairly modern computers. There’s also a free demo on Steam if you’re unsure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8jAVm"&gt;The tradeoff, of course, is that &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; is a much less visually impressive game than &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;. It still looks good at higher resolutions, and the PC version has improved assets like much sharper textures, but the complexity of the environments and foliage density in particular takes a big hit. That’s partly just how the levels are designed, so it’s not surprising that Capcom hasn’t overhauled &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; entirely, but set your expectations accordingly. &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; looks stylish more than stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7HmCL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Steam cross-save is a game-changer for the Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143520/nintendo-switch-steam-cross-save-witcher-3"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8QGAsV"&gt;What’s disappointing about &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; on PC, though, is that I’ve already played a lot of it on the Switch. After the original &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; and its &lt;em&gt;Iceborne&lt;/em&gt; expansion, this marks the third big &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game in a row that’s come to PC several months after its console release. These are huge games that can be played for hundreds of hours, and the prospect of starting all over again and slogging through the easy early quests isn’t going to be appealing for most experienced players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IcnRp"&gt;This wouldn’t be as much of a problem if Capcom allowed for save transfer between PC and Switch, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143520/nintendo-switch-steam-cross-save-witcher-3"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; in other big games like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin 2&lt;/em&gt;, but the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1447630591302713345"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s “unable” to implement the feature. While there may well be technical challenges involved, it’s particularly regrettable because Capcom was ahead of the curve in this regard when handling transfers between the Wii U and 3DS versions of &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter 3&lt;/em&gt;. Capcom evidently understands that it’s great to make progress on the go and continue on better hardware when you’re at home — you can dock your Switch to a TV, of course, but it’s not the same experience as this PC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdkS3s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is a great game that’s even better on PC, but it’s hard to recommend if you’ve already played it on the Switch and don’t have unlimited free time. If you managed to get a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; preorder, though, this could well be the perfect game to christen it with for anyone looking to get into the series. It’s just unfortunate that &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; enthusiasts who already jumped on &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; will have to start from scratch. I hope Capcom releases future &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; games on PC at the same time as consoles, or finds a way to include cross-save functionality — ideally both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESrpJj"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Monster Hunter Rise &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on the PC on January 12th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Corsair gaming keyboards are cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wb46ceNX1uW7uf4rnffZq-Q_kdU=/1x0:2400x1599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374082/6453148cv27d.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IGds5H"&gt;We found three discounted gaming keyboards from Corsair that should please most people, coming in a variety of form factors and with different features. First up is Corsair’s first 60 percent keyboard, the K65. This compact keyboard is normally $109.99 but has recently dropped to $89.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgohljzOVZz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Customizable-Backlighting-Keyswitches-Hyper-Processing/dp/B08W2CSXLM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. We last saw the K65 drop to this price during Black Friday. While the diminutive layout of this keyboard certainly isn’t for everyone, it should appeal to those who are striving for a minimalist aesthetic on their desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZCQVV"&gt;Just like other 60 percent keyboards, the K65 eliminates the function row, directional arrows, and navigation keys that let you easily go up and down the page. This keyboard uses Cherry MX Silver switches and uses a detachable USB-C connector. The PBT keycaps even use a standard layout, allowing you to swap in custom keycap sets if you want.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ob5nj0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yOV7bi"&gt;The most conventional keyboard we’re including today is the Corsair K70 RGB 2 Rapidfire. This model typically retails for $169.99, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgohFMQJviC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-MK-2-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B07D5S54C5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have discounted this full-size keyboard to $109.99. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, it’s a good value for anyone in the market for a keyboard that doesn’t skimp on any features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm59Su"&gt;The K70 RGB 2 Rapidfire features dedicated media playback buttons, USB passthrough, and is equipped with Cherry MX Silver switches. While the keycaps are ABS plastic, which aren’t as durable as PBT caps, the K70’s standard layout means you can easily swap them out with some custom PBT keycaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uxz8Ne"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970731"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aTNR5r"&gt;The final Corsair model being discounted is something of an oddity. The K60 RGB Low Profile is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Profile-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08J6FC3F3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $79.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a solid discount on its typical $109.99 price tag. This gaming keyboard maintains a full-size footprint with a number pad and function row, but it employs a shorter version of the Cherry MX Speed switch paired with slimmer keycaps. The end result is a keyboard with low-profile keys, which for some may offer a slightly more comfortable typing experience. While the slimmer chassis still supports USB passthrough, the keycaps are, again, ABS plastic, not PBT, and will likely slowly accumulate visible grease and fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L335XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970772"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uv2W7V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The ROG Strix Flare II Animate puts a tiny dot-matrix display on a keyboard  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867722/asus-strix-flare-ii-animate-keyboard-mini-led-dot-matrix-display-swapable-key-switches"},{"title":"How and why I built my first mechanical keyboard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18683728/mechanical-keyboard-diy-building-guide-how-to-75-percent-pcb-case-zealio-keyswitches-zealpc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1IhucM"&gt;One of the most feature-packed mice from Razer, the Basilisk Ultimate is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Ultimate-HyperSpeed-Wireless/dp/B07YPBX9Y7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $113.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgog6uQT2q0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This wireless mouse features eight programmable buttons, a 25K DPI sensor, and is capable of lasting for up to 100 hours on a single charge. The Basilisk Ultimate also comes equipped with a detachable DPI switch that allows you to quickly swap between DPI settings and adjustable tension for its scroll wheel. Some call it a sniper button, as it can let you more easily line up a shot with a lower DPI. The mouse is definitely a bit on the heavy side, weighing in at 103 grams, but if larger mice don’t bother you, the Basilisk Ultimate is an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X0Y6dW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970679"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNOdiD"&gt;Westinghouse may not be the first name you associate with gaming monitors, but this 32-inch panel presents an amazing value. Typically $299.99, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16824569005" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg has discounted this monitor to just $229.99&lt;/a&gt;. Boasting a 1440p resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, this model shares features with other gaming monitors that are nearly double the price. The Westinghouse Gaming Monitor also features AMD FreeSync to help cut down on screen tearing with AMD graphics cards, and in terms of ports, you’re getting a pair of HDMI connections, a single Display Port input, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The monitor is compatible with VESA mounts, and the included stand is both height and tilt adjustable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="h1lxhf"&gt;If you’re in the market for a decent webcam, or just a webcam equipped with its own dedicated lighting, the Razer Kiyo is currently discounted to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-Built/dp/B075N1BYWB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60.99, its lowest price ever at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The specs are fairly standard for a standalone sub-$100 webcam, capable of capturing 30fps at 1080p or 60fps at 720p. However, the standout feature of this webcam is the built-in ring light, which can be very helpful in low-light situations or anywhere that suffers from uneven lighting. Just like virtually all of Razer’s peripherals, the Kiyo is compatible with its Synapse software which also allows you to fine-tune things like depth of field and lighting temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="XU6JrU"&gt;More gaming deals you may find tempting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ki1zwY"&gt;

&lt;li id="5kqkCH"&gt;That ISP-provided modem (that you may be paying each month to loan) might be holding back the download and upload speeds that you pay for. Arris’ Surfboard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 modem boasts support for Xfinity, Cox, and Spectrum internet (Arris says it’s compatible with most US cable providers), and it might be a great fit for your needs. It offers up to 683Mbps download and 131Mbps upload.

    <title>Nvidia announces new RTX 3080 with 12GB of memory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gaTcf-OIPeSuxljaheXPB-VBogw=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374076/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESTLWN"&gt;Nvidia is launching a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F30-series%2Frtx-3080-3080ti%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878021%2Fnvidia-rtx-3080-12gb-model-release-date-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new 12GB model&lt;/a&gt; of its RTX 3080 today. Revealed initially in Nvidia’s latest GeForce drivers, the new 12GB model goes on sale today from select board partners and offers 2GB more memory than the original 10GB RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NioVbA"&gt;A memory bump is welcome, particularly as it was a source of concern during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;initial review of the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. It also matches the 12GB found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;RTX 3080 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. This new RTX 3080 model also includes 8960 CUDA cores, a bump of nearly 3 percent over the original. The upgraded memory also means this GPU has 20 percent more cumulative bandwidth over the original 10GB variant, thanks to a wider 384-bit memory bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qgtTu"&gt;Nvidia is still recommending a 750W power supply, but this 12GB RTX 3080 draws an extra 30 watts of power, up to 350 watts in total compared to the 320W draw on the original RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1AKxj"&gt;It’s a relatively minor upgrade over the original RTX 3080, and it’s guaranteed to be as difficult to purchase in stores. Nvidia’s new 12GB RTX 3080 arrives just days after the company also announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;new RTX 3090 Ti&lt;/a&gt; with faster memory and better performance, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22864989/nvidia-rtx-3050-gpu-ray-tracing-dlss-price-release-date-ces-2022"&gt;$249 RTX 3050&lt;/a&gt;. The budget RTX 3050 offers ray tracing and DLSS support at a much more affordable price, assuming you’re about to snag one at retail price. Nvidia is promising to detail more about the RTX 3090 Ti later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9T6Yx"&gt;RTX 3080 12GB pricing will be determined largely by board partners, so we’re waiting to hear more announcements from vendors to determine exactly how this new GPU will be priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXjmjU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 11th 9:15AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to note full pricing details for the new RTX 3080 aren’t available yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is an emotional culmination of a decade-long journey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H06KEjhgIckA5peHQnE1ciWcxaY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373989/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_32__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Thou must live, die, and know&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hWThCZ"&gt;The easiest way to describe &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is to call it a game about hope. That’s not really a unique descriptor since, to some degree, all &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games, MMORPG or otherwise, are about hope. (Not&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy VIII, &lt;/em&gt;though — that game is about child soldiers and hot dogs.) However, despite &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s unflagging commitment to “the power of friendship,” it’s the game’s unvarnished look at the other side of hope — oppressive and omnipresent despair — and the real strength it takes to maintain that hope in the face of such despair that makes it the best &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; experiences I’ve had in 30-plus years of the series’ existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXiBiJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Endwalker Spoilers throughout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4vx-ff7set65XWpkWjTVv6IkfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159274/FFXIV_1106PLL_Mediakit_Launch_Trailer_06.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eyXo9K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To all of my children in whom Life flows abundant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To all of my children to whom Death hath passed his judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soul yearns for honor, and the flesh the hereafter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look to those who walked before to lead those who walk after&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyETOq"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, the latest expansion of the Final Fantasy XIV MMORPG, your character and their rag-tag group of mercenaries for hire masquerading as a benevolent, non-governmental organization are tasked with averting the second occurrence of The Final Days, an apocalyptic event that sundered the world and all its people a millennium or so previous. Through the events of the previous expansion, you learn that the malevolent force Zodiark is key to unlocking the mystery of why the Final Days have returned, necessitating a trip to his prison on the moon. Because this is a JRPG and a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; game, besides, the plot isn’t as straightforward as that. Though this quick and dirty plot summary and &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer would have you believe Zodiark and the moon are your end goals, you conclude that plot in the first quarter of the expansion. What follows is a 60-plus-hour &lt;em&gt;feast&lt;/em&gt; of emotions that wrap up the last 10 years and four expansions’ worth of story in the most perfect of bows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orPHei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shining is the Land’s light of justice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever flows the Land’s well of purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z391l3"&gt;I play video games because I love stories, and video games promise me, more than books or movies, the opportunity to live in a story. I derive pleasure from suspending disbelief, imagining the characters I interact with as alive, their words and deeds organic and authentic, not a series of 1s and 0s strung together by someone else. Games are immersive and interactive, but there will always be an impenetrable veil between my real life and the fabrication of life a game presents. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;is a game that gets the closest to piercing that veil. It’s in the way the developers wrote the characters, the way the game lets me respond to those characters, and even the way the game makes my character emote in cutscenes. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, more than any of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s expansions, feels so alive I barely noticed the extremely late sleep-deprived nights I spent working my way through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrUMcL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walk free, walk free, walk free, believe...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Land is alive, so believe&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnk42P"&gt;The technical and financial limitations of video game development mean that the way stories are written and how characters act rarely reflect how real people behave and how real emotions are felt. In a video game, the death of a major character might evoke a singular moment of sadness wherein the game acknowledges a beloved friend died, before returning to normal, the death barely or never again recalled. By contrast, dealing with real grief isn’t a linear process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTTLLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;acknowledges grieving’s messy, winding road. In conversations with your companions, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; will suddenly flash back to a snowy grave and a broken shield, reminding you of Haurchefant Greystone, a friend who died protecting you way back in &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt;. The game remembers the sadness you felt in that moment and brings it back for you to feel again multiple times though it’s been several years and two expansions since, the same way real grief can suddenly reappear unbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDa-uMSuplBnE3B0v3jMEFpzVtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159323/2021_04_18_14_31_54_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Final Fantasy has never once let you forget Haurchefant’s sacrifice, and for that, I’ll love this game forever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JYiCI5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suffer (Feel) Promise (Think) Witness (Teach) Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Follow (Feel) Wander (Think) Stumble (Teach) Listen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Speak) Honor (Speak) Value (Tell) Whisper (Tell) Mention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgoBhm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;also exhibits what authentic growth as a person looks like. At the end of &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt;, your enemy, before he perishes, asks that you remember him and his extinct peoples. This adversary, Emet-Selch, fought against you because the only way for him to bring back his people is the destruction of your world. (Long story, but it makes sense in context.) Later in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a conversation in which you can respond, “Remember,” as though Emet-Selch’s words were something you took to heart. In other conversations, you can respond with quotes you’ve heard from friends lost expansions ago — “a smile better suits a hero,” or “for those we have lost, and for those we can yet save” — making it feel like the events of previous expansions weren’t just cutscenes you watched but lessons you learned from and acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xxk1am"&gt;This kind of grief and growth isn’t limited to the player character but your companions as well. One character, Alphinaud, makes a pretty terrible mistake back in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt;. Most games would have him apologize and move on, never referencing that mistake again. But for Alphinaud, in every expansion after his transgression, he brings up how he’s still trying to learn from it, demonstrating that remorse and repentance aren’t states of being but active processes that must be worked on continuously. I hated Alphinaud for his mistake. Of my companions, I liked him the least. All throughout &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;, I bore a grudge against him, a grudge that softened each time he recalled that mistake, owned it, and did things that showed he was working on never making that mistake again. By&lt;em&gt; Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, he was as dear to me as Haurchefant, something that only happened because the game didn’t force his redemption in a quick turnaround but showed it gradually and authentically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MKSqC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Endwalker is a 60-plus-hour &lt;em&gt;feast&lt;/em&gt; of emotions that wrap up the last 10 years and four expansions’ worth of story in the most perfect of bows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2PDFj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hope) Ponder (Hope) Warrant (Wish) Cherish (Wish) Welcome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Roam) Witness (Roam) Listen (Roam) Suffer (Roam) Sanction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sleep) Weather (Sleep) Wander (Sleep) Answer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsW2sp"&gt;In MMOs and other games in which you can create and personalize the main character, you’re often a blank slate. The bits of your personality you can give your avatar don’t extend beyond its physical appearance. Even in games that let you choose dialogue, you only get close to what you might actually say. In the rare moments &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; let you speak, the dialogue often reflected my exact feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDa7hY"&gt;In the game’s final zone, your comrades sacrifice themselves one by one in order for you to reach the final antagonist. Your last remaining companions are Alphinaud and his twin sister Alisaie — who had an easier time than her brother getting into my heart because I love her “punch the problem until it’s no longer a problem” attitude. They know, and you know that they’ll have to sacrifice themselves in order for you to continue. When Alphinaud tried to bring this up, I shouted at my screen, “Shut up! I don’t want to hear this,” because I couldn’t process losing characters I thought of as my children, especially after already losing all of my other companions. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s writers knew what I and many others were likely feeling at this moment, offering me the perfect dialogue response: “Not. Another. Word.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDc0iW9xI4Vmbt0xwbYVMpXpFwU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159320/2022_01_04_14_50_41_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;I get by with a little help from my friends.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kUwcSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now open your eyes while our plight is repeated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still deaf to our cries, lost in hope we lie defeated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaS3WH"&gt;In addition to giving me the perfect dialogue choices, I’m impressed by &lt;em&gt;Endwalker’&lt;/em&gt;s ability to intuit exactly what I want as a player. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s writers know the game’s strength lies in its characters. So often, character-driven games like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will shunt you from quest to quest, giving you very little time to do what you really came for — to just hang out with your pals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue058b"&gt;In the latter half, the player is sent into the past in hopes of learning what happened during the first Final Days. There, I was reintroduced to characters I met and had grown attached to in &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt;. My first thought was, “Oh, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; let me run a dungeon with them,” thinking there was no way that would happen. (In &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;, you can run dungeons with other players or create a party out of your NPC companions.) Even though these characters occupy a significant place in &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;’s lore, they would only be around for this one area. I believed there was no way the developers would invest in making them combat-capable for what could only be a one-off thing. One of my first true shocks and moments of pure delight was when the game let me run a dungeon with Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus, and Venat watching my back. It’s one of the coolest story moments in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCPiTf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our souls have been torn, and our bodies forsaken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bearing sins of the past, for our future is taken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfpp1r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t really innovate in its gameplay, but its story is so good that it doesn’t have to. My two main jobs are gunbreaker and astrologian — a tank and healer class, respectively. Tweaks to the leveling system meant that the main story quest line didn’t reward enough EXP for me to level my two classes. A lot of times, there wasn’t enough main story quest EXP to take a single job from one level to the next, requiring me to create an elaborate and efficient EXP extraction plan so I could level my two jobs evenly with minimal grinding, which I utterly hate. Frustrating as all that math was, I enjoyed the intricate dance of dungeon running and side-questing; it kept the calmer, less exciting parts of the story interesting. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of running full tilt at a fate — quests available only at a certain place for a certain amount of time — hoping to get there before other players complete it and its sweet, sweet double EXP award is lost to you forever. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zzcPMFDddvcyRsOGSlWX8KCTPmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159372/2022_01_05_21_00_29_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Endwalker is so well constructed that this character is not merely an avatar of me, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; me. (And she’s so pretty!)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tqxZur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;War born of strife, these trials persuade us not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words without sound, these lies betray our thoughts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mired by a plague of doubt, the Land, she mourns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judgment binds all we hold to a memory of scorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3AyVk"&gt;There is no way anyone at Square Enix could have known &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; would launch in the middle of a global pandemic, when its message of radical, defiant hope would hit the strongest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIsiWs"&gt;Its main antagonist, Meteion, is a being made to intuit others’ emotions and tasked with understanding life. To that end, she was sent to find sentient beings on other planets to ask them their meaning of life. Meteion found planets destroyed by war or natural catastrophe or populated by beings who so lamented their achievement of immortality that only death could give comfort. Finding nothing but death, and so subsumed by the infinity of suffering she found, she concluded that life is meaningless and death preferable, so she sets in motion the end of all life everywhere.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8GVjr"&gt;Omicron rages in the United States, where we recently broke the global record for number of infections in a single day. Even as vaccines become more available, every day, people die by the thousands, forced to say goodbye to loved ones through the cold, impersonal screens of cellphones and tablets. Every day, I live and labor in a country in which its hate for my people and other marginalized identities are baked into its every institution. I struggle under the oppressive weight of a government that would risk its citizens’ health and safety in order to keep an economy running. Every day, my social media feeds are choked with tales of pain and sadness, preventable and not. Now, more than ever, it seems like life is a pointless struggle, and I can barely find the strength to keep going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRXlBP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell us why, given Life, we are meant to die, helpless in our cries?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGt4MJ"&gt;Video games like to answer this dilemma of hopelessness with a protagonist or companions who have either boundless optimism or boundless strength. Whatever they have, it’s always enough to overcome the problem. It’s the same kind of toxic positivity of social media influencers. “Everything will be OK so long as you believe.” It’s a philosophy that takes the act of faith for granted without confronting the reality of how hard it is to believe in the face of the relentless suffering life throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KlxAvz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So often, character-driven games like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will shunt you from quest to quest, giving you very little time to do what you really came for — to just hang out with your pals. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeCBaR"&gt;Throughout your journey in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV,&lt;/em&gt; your character endured prolific suffering and loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMMwZP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t blindly ask of you your faith. Rather, it uses the trials of your character’s life as proof you already have the strength required to continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xni20y"&gt;In a world beset by relentless bleakness, I need that message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJhoJv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness (Feel) Suffer (Think) Borrow (Teach) Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Follow (Feel) Stumble (Think) Wander (Teach) Listen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxo5xg"&gt;I am the kind of person for which aural memories last longer and evoke more emotion in me than memories of sight or touch. When I first saw the trailer for &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; back in 2013, even though I hadn’t played the original doomed &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV &lt;/em&gt;before its reboot and wouldn’t play until years later in 2021, I cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="etom6B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h542YbZuwkQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5j7gj"&gt;In the trailer, there’s a fierce battle in which it looks like the good guys are losing badly. I didn’t know who any of the characters were, nor did I care about them, but I still cried as a woman sang, lamenting their pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HahuvI"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, one of the first songs you hear isn’t the song “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zTTtd6bnhFs"&gt;Footfalls&lt;/a&gt;” from the trailer — it’s this song “Answers” from nine years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mom1Lk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; game director Naoki Yoshida said that &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; would be the conclusion of the story begun in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; — the story begun by this trailer. I was skeptical that a single expansion could deliver on that promise, believing it would still be an enjoyable experience but fail to live up to such vaunted expectations. But when &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; first played “Answers,” I understood that whatever happened, it would make good on Yoshida’s declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pDPoG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; songfic — a common fanfiction format in which a story is based around a song. The story evokes the song’s themes and sometimes the song’s lyrics are woven into the text of the story itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIi6pW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Blink) Whisper (Blink) Shoulder (Blink) Ponder (Blink) Weather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Answer (Look) Answer (Think) Answer together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQpHok"&gt;The true beauty of &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is realizing that for a decade, we’ve been working backward. Yoshida meant for &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; to tie up everything that began in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; and achieves that by having &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; ask the question &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn &lt;/em&gt;answered 10 years ago: what is the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1czZk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thy Life is a riddle, to bear rapture and sorrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To listen, to suffer, to entrust unto tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkhuvM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; does not mince its words. It nakedly acknowledges in a way games seldom do that life really does seem pointless in the face of omnipresent death.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qR5ZhPbdoMW-oUfRT3fXbCmXeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159306/2022_01_10_16_14_06_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yes, G’raha Tia, you can haz cheezburger&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GiHA9v"&gt;Early in the game, you’re given the opportunity to take a break from all the terror that accompanies the end of the world and have a party with your friends. The table was littered with some of the best-looking video game food I’ve seen, including a tasty cheeseburger the party’s resident catboy, G’raha Tia, tears into, in fulfillment of an internet question asked ages ago — &lt;a href="https://cheezburger.com/875511040/original-cat-meme-that-started-cheezburger"&gt;yes, you can has cheeseburger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dx2524"&gt;That’s it. That’s life. A struggle for survival punctuated by pockets of joy made sweeter because of the loved ones around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0xTLq"&gt;I don’t need a video game to teach me a lesson, especially if the lesson is essentially “Life sucks, and then you die.” But it’s nice to have a game that acknowledges shit sucks without overselling its misery while also ending on a hopeful note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNLf4r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In one fleeting moment, from the Land doth life flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet in one fleeting moment, for anew it doth grow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the same fleeting moment thou must live, die and know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Done your Wordle for the day? Try out these spoofs instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4oIxtrk6Ty8ioXNMa97iJqpYpSo=/17x0:635x412/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373921/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_12.56.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stupidest (and hence best) Wordle spoof we’ve seen: Letterle. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://edjefferson.com/letterle/" target="_blank"&gt;@edjeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V7UXTF"&gt;Part of the charm of &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; — this season’s must-play puzzle game — is that you can only do it once a day. But that’s also part of the frustration, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H30ziS"&gt;For while it is wonderful to think to yourself: “Ah, a coffee break. Time to sit down and do my Wordle” (part and parcel of the indulgent “&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3ed08931-80b0-43a0-9bba-6c4bcc1b3e70"&gt;treat brain&lt;/a&gt;” we all seem to have developed during the pandemic), you sometimes want to scratch that puzzle itch just a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkHipr"&gt;With that in mind, here are some of the best and stupidest Wordle spoofs we’ve seen so far. They either push the format to ridiculous degrees, offer genuinely fun challenges, or are single-click jokes that may, at least, help temporarily release you of your Wordle cravings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zmnlro"&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://sweardle.glitch.me/"&gt;Sweardle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4l0CY70wM6DMU2eBGvWu8I9Y17w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160485/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.06.05_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nVHFWT"&gt;This one does exactly what the name suggests. You’re guessing swear words instead of words from Wordle’s more expansive vocabulary. Results are delivered with snippy little remarks: “Correct. I’m sure your mother will be very proud,” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v5dYdv"&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://queerdle.com/"&gt;Queerdle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFyPoFizRi_DdW-gAlFSorm-RaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160488/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.07.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1lmmpc"&gt;Wordle but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/style/yassify-bot-meme.html#:~:text=To%20%E2%80%9Cyassify%E2%80%9D%20something%2C%20in,becomes%20almost%20unrecognizably%20made%20up."&gt;yassified&lt;/a&gt;, with a pastel background and on-theme congratulations (“Shantay you stay!”). The creator warns that winning words are more likely to be NSFW than with Wordle, but there are shortcuts to winning. As one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1479349936525385729"&gt;commenter on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; put it: “the secret to Wordle is knowing the distribution of letters in English and opening with words that have a lot of common letters in them. the secret to Queerdle is doing this once and then guessing the gay word.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o7uD2K"&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://edjefferson.com/letterle/"&gt;Letterle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ZkCwkaAPVgVPZCp1fFQ1TeBWro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160495/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.15.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7zranS"&gt;I love a single-click spoof as much as the next person, and Letterle delivers on that score. Every day it offers a new and tantalizing puzzle! Every day you have the chance to test your wits and intelligence by guessing a single hidden letter! How devious! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3tbK2"&gt;I got today’s in just six guesses, which, I choose to believe, is as good and as rigorous a proof of Mensa-level IQ as any other test on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IJip76"&gt;4) &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/files/wordle/index.html"&gt;Absurdle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87UfsRh8u38ElzAgZXWVhcVuir0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160497/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.17.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ROOpnQ"&gt;This is a self-described “adversarial version” of Wordle. As explained &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/wordle"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Absurdle tweaks the rules of Wordle to make the game harder as you take more guesses. While Wordle fixes its objective word each day, Absurdle &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; the word you’re hunting for each time you submit a successful guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtD56h"&gt;So, for example, Absurdle might start with the word “CIGAR” for which you guess “TERNS.” The game notes that you got the “R” right, but then changes its location with a new word: “REBUT.” And so on and so forth. Basically it makes a game of Wordle harder and longer. But you do get infinite guesses as compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4kBOgh"&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://foldr.moe/hello-wordl/"&gt;hello wordl&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rd3K9K9LHSM512MZE79uG-qji0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160499/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.22.08_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnYUKt"&gt;This one is exactly the same as Wordle, but you can play multiple times a day &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; change the length of the word you’re guessing. If you manage to solve anything with more than six letters then congratulations to you. I struggled for 10 minutes with a 10-letter puzzle only to give up and be told the word was... adrenergic. Warning: for masochists only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGVJg"&gt;If you’ve seen any other decent Wordle spoofs (or just fun alternatives) feel free to drop them in the comments below. The &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Slack is overrun with Wordle addicts, and we could do with a new way to get our fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NordicTrack will now let you yell at its smart dumbbells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman does russian twists with dumbbells while watching a workout on a tablet attached to the rack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3t-fDE8GB2gWTcI61BMJNlDJHA=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373777/Female_Twist_NordicTrack_iSelect_Voice_Controlled_Dumbbells.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NordicTrack’s new smart adjustable dumbbells also come with a tablet holder in the rack.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: iFIT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8CO05f"&gt;Smart dumbbells aren’t new in connected fitness, but today, NordicTrack is announcing a unique take on the product. The NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells are voice-controlled weights that work with Amazon Alexa. As in, you can now ask Alexa to adjust how heavy your dumbbells are instead of having to do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQHfcY"&gt;The dumbbells can be electronically adjusted between five and 50 pounds in five-pound increments. According to iFit, NordicTrack’s parent company, the dumbbells feature a “motorized weight selector” that enables users to quickly change the weight of the device. As for the Alexa integration, you can ask the voice assistant to set a specific weight, increase or decrease weight, or create a preset weight for specific exercises. You can create presets for 15 common dumbbell moves: biceps curls, overhead shoulder press, lateral shoulder raises, front shoulder raise, triceps extension, bent-over row, chest press, squat, deadlift, lunge, lateral lunge, wood chop, chest fly, reverse fly, and renegade row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tum6KB"&gt;While an iFit subscription is not required to use the dumbbells, the weights come with a free one-month family membership. You also need a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection, ostensibly for firmware upgrades and other support features. The dumbbells also come with their own rack, which is outfitted with a tablet holder so you can follow along with workouts from either iFit or whichever fitness app of your choice. The dumbbells can also be adjusted manually via a knob.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Woman turns knob embedded into the rack to adjust dumbbell weight" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oWgM6-vO6q5UCZc8d4XRbfdOOyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159342/Mechanical_Adjust_NordicTrack_iSelect_Voice_Controlled_Dumbbells.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also adjust the weights manually via a knob.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5PfOB0"&gt;At this point, you might be wondering: what is the point of voice-controlled dumbbells? Aside from accessibility reasons, it boils down to speed. If you’ve ever followed along with a fitness app’s strength training class, you’re often given only 10-30 seconds in between sets. Many adjustable dumbbells work using a pin mechanism to attach or detach additional plates — meaning if you rush, you can wind up with a plate falling off mid-exercise. (True story: instead of hitting pause, I rushed while tweaking my adjustable dumbbells and ended up with a five-pound plate smacking me in the face during a chest press.) You also have to return the dumbbells to the rack each time to add or take off plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AntlKA"&gt;If the dumbbells can actually quickly and safely change weights, that’d solve one of the biggest problems with adjustable dumbbells. However, other connected weights make similar promises with mixed results. I tested &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/jaxjox-kettlebell-connect-review-this-connected-kettle-1844285865"&gt;JaxJox’s smart adjustable kettlebell&lt;/a&gt;, and while it was convenient, it still took a hot second for the electronic locking mechanism to secure the weights. In this case, you’d still have to contend with Alexa understanding your commands, good Wi-Fi, and background noise from whatever class you’re watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Gj2Ja"&gt;At $429, these are on the cheaper end of connected fitness equipment but are still a hefty investment for the average person. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21443765/buying-dumbbells-online-expensive-resellers"&gt;dumbbell prices have been wonky&lt;/a&gt; ever since the start of the pandemic thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21396116/dumbbell-set-shortage-nordictrack-bowflex"&gt;shortages and shipping delays&lt;/a&gt;. As far as adjustable weights go, options with a similar weight range can cost anywhere from $200 to over $500. A full dumbbell rack can cost a few hundred or go well into the thousands of dollars — and may take up much more space than you’d like in your home. Another factor to keep in mind is that you need an Alexa-enabled device to use the voice controls. If you don’t have already have one, that’s another purchase to tack on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8lnLb"&gt;We’d have to review the NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells before we can definitively say how useful the voice-control feature is. But if you’re impatient, the dumbbells are available starting today at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/3036981011?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordicTrack’s Amazon store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify shuts down its namesake podcast studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it6jtllLRW5240UPkUQieAcnIMw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373807/mdoying_180308_1437_0030still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71v860"&gt;Spotify is disbanding its founding podcast studio and laying off some of the team. An affected employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Studio 4, or Spotify Studios as it’s been referenced externally, consisted of 10 to 15 employees and produced shows like &lt;em&gt;Dissect &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Chapo: Kingpin on Trial&lt;/em&gt;. Spotify called affected employees on Friday and said their last days would be January 21st. They’ll receive two months’ worth of severance. Some employees were reassigned while others were laid off and pointed to the Spotify job board. The studio’s head, Gina Delvac, was also let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OelVqs"&gt;Spotify declined to comment. In a note to Spotify staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, Julie McNamara, head of US studios and video, acknowledged the layoffs and said shutting the studio down would enable the company to “move faster and make more significant progress and facilitate more effective collaboration across our organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdXRxB"&gt;For a company sharing news of its podcasting endeavors most anywhere it can, Studio 4 rarely, if ever, showed up in the press. (I only documented one public use of it.) However, Studio 4 &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; occasionally appear in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;earnings reports&lt;/a&gt; as Spotify Studios. It was the first podcasting studio Spotify created and consisted of all the employees who worked on podcasting prior to the company’s major network acquisitions. Additional employees were later hired, but the initial group helped prove the podcasting business model and listener interest with shows like &lt;em&gt;Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls 1 Keith&lt;/em&gt;, says a former employee who asked not to be identified due to ongoing work in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="agRZsB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1522405"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xItWBc"&gt;The team eventually rounded out Spotify’s in-house studio offerings, including its three acquired networks: Parcast, Gimlet, and The Ringer. The Studio 4 name is literal, as in it’s the fourth studio at Spotify. It’s also, as one Spotify employee put it to me, “insulting” to the people who work there, given that it has no brand identity or mission statement. They say it often operated more like a “junk drawer” for projects that didn’t find a home within the other three networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tbRof"&gt;“When you have Studio 4, it’s like, ‘Well, if all of these boxes are already checked by all of these other studios, then where does that really leave us,’ and so it felt to me like there was no clear mandate of what Studio 4 was supposed to do,” the affected employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcXcJG"&gt;Though the studio didn’t have its own clear initiatives, its content covered music and artists as well as celebrity deals and influencer-hosted content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t09lSM"&gt;“A lot of the successes that Spotify Studios had were never really vocalized because the leadership was always churning,” the former employee says, pointing out that Liz Gately &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/spotify-liz-gateley-podcast-creative-development-1203152298/"&gt;formerly ran&lt;/a&gt; the studio but was then &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/liz-gateley-to-transition-to-consultant-role-at-spotify-4107080/"&gt;shuffled&lt;/a&gt; into a new role. Delvac took over, and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-julie-mcnamara-1235007800/"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; McNamara &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-julie-mcnamara-1235007800/"&gt;was hired&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the team. Courtney Holt, VP of global podcasting, previously held the role. (Above Holt and McNamara sits Dawn Ostroff, chief content and advertising officer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orjDdZ"&gt;“I have never once heard anybody mentioned Studio 4 by name or point to any of the work or the shows that we’ve done as something to be celebrated,” the affected employee says. “We’re being intentionally disregarded in explanations about metrics, and growth, and listenership, and all that kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lK2kgp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc8C0C"&gt;“When you go through a year of that ... where you’re behind the scenes, and you’re creating things, and it just doesn’t get the love or the shine that the other studios get, I think that causes a lot of rightful thoughts to be going through your head of like, ‘Hey, what does the upper echelon of the executive community at Spotify think about the studio, what we’re doing, and how easily could they just sweep it under the rug,’ which they ended up ultimately doing,” the former employee adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HKcWR"&gt;The team most recently produced programming like &lt;em&gt;Nosy Neighbors, We Said What We Said&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Dope Labs&lt;/em&gt;, as well as partner programs like Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s 2020 holiday special. The former employee says that one show, &lt;em&gt;Wind of Change&lt;/em&gt;, was produced under the studio, but was then handed to Gimlet to oversee the next release in the Pineapple Street Studios partnership — &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Your Fantasy. &lt;/em&gt;They say&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;successes were given away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsNvk4"&gt;Since Studio 4’s inception, Spotify spent millions not only buying up new studios and networks, but also securing high-profile deals with big podcasting names like Joe Rogan, Alex Cooper of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534981/spotify-exclusive-podcast-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Dax Shepard of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also focused heavily on its ad technology with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of hosting company Megaphone, which was the centerpiece of most of the company’s announcements this past year. However, Spotify hasn’t shared numbers on how its acquired entities are doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLDnMI"&gt;Though Spotify says more podcasts than ever are on its platform, an August &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-leaked-data-gimlet-podcast-studio-struggled-2021-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; said Gimlet itself has struggled to grow inside the tech company due to “unclear strategy” and “internal tensions.” It had the lowest numbers of all four studios in terms of consumption hours in leaked metrics for September 2020. Meanwhile, a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632213/joe-rogan-experience-spotify-exclusive-audience-reach"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Spotify’s licensed exclusives, Joe Rogan’s show specifically, might have lost a significant chunk of its audience in the move to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6A8gOY"&gt;For now, Spotify hasn’t said how partner programs will be produced moving forward and what will happen to shows currently in production. Original programming will obviously live on within the three networks Spotify bought, but Studio 4’s shutdown shows that Spotify wasn’t able to build a wholly independent production team from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGAaVu"&gt;When asked what the studio’s biggest show was, or what people should know about, the affected employee couldn’t name one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1EpGi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 11th, 8:59AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article previously stated that Julie McNamara worked under Courtney Holt. That was incorrect. Holt only previously held McNamara’s job, and he now leads a separate team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox players are fed up with forced crossplay against PC gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7dXLX2wLXjzQ5_Nh6k8o8gAcvA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373674/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNt15I"&gt;Xbox players are growing increasingly frustrated at being forced to play against PC gamers. While crossplay was initially a popular request from Xbox and PC players that Microsoft has backed strongly for years, those playing first-person shooters on Xbox are struggling to opt out of the experience to avoid PC cheaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sye9V7"&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;force Xbox players to match against PC gamers in a variety of playlists. You don’t have to look very far to see why people are angry about it. “Now that cheating in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; is confirmed on PC, can we have to option to opt out of cross-play?” asked one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/qzkinm/now_that_cheating_in_halo_is_confirmed_on_pc_can/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in November, just weeks after the multiplayer version of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pVCUT"&gt;“Forced crossplay is a scam by Microsoft,” reads another post in &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/forced-crossplay-is-a-scam-by-microsoft/483900"&gt;Microsoft’s Halo Waypoint forums&lt;/a&gt;. “Forced crossplay is a mistake,” says &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/qurwr9/infinite_forced_crossplay_is_a_mistake/"&gt;another Redditor&lt;/a&gt;, and the list &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/qytykn/why_must_we_be_forced_into_crossplay/"&gt;goes on&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/rbcijs/halo_infinite_is_proof_that_sbmm_and_forced/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://xbox-forums.com/threads/microsofts-push-of-forcing-crossplay-between-pc-and-xbox-is-ruining-multiplayer-gaming.466559/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jCrKMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"},{"title":"Cheaters are ruining Call of Duty: Warzone ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem"},{"title":"Call of Duty’s new anti-cheat system includes a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"},{"title":"Cheaters are already ruining Halo Infinite multiplayer games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XmrZMi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; are both suffering from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;influx of cheating&lt;/a&gt;, largely because they’re free-to-play titles so it’s easy for hackers to create a new account following a ban. While there’s an option to disable crossplay in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, if you try to load into a playlist on Xbox it will ask you to re-enable it. Whereas on PlayStation you can simply dismiss the prompt and continue to the playlist with crossplay still disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck7OvZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;players on Xbox have been complaining about this forced crossplay for more than a year, with various &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/call-of-duty-warzone-forced-crossplay/e9682d44-89e9-4c5e-a9ef-55ad6c2c89ea"&gt;forum posts&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/E28PF-UUpTs"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; highlighting how irritating it is to be forced into crossplay. Most of the issues are related to PC cheaters, who have plagued &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; for years before Activision finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;added a new anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt; in October with a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5LuOI"&gt;Now that cheaters are already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"&gt;ruining &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer games&lt;/a&gt;, the call to remove forced crossplay is certainly growing louder. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; players on Xbox are matched against PC gamers in most playlists, and even in ranked modes you have to play solo or as a duo to avoid forced crossplay against different inputs. If you want to squad up as a team of three or four Xbox players, you’ll be forced to play against PC players in ranked &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; modes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite is already suffering from an influx of cheaters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ65cM"&gt;Microsoft’s decision to force crossplay in its own &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; title runs against previous commitments from the company’s head of Xbox. “I’ll never force somebody in our games whose playing with a controller or a mouse and keyboard to play against somebody with a different control scheme,” said Xbox chief Phil Spencer in an &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-head-talks-gaming-across-xbox-one-and-pc/1100-6436153/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Gamespot&lt;/em&gt; in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. “Mouse and keyboard rotation speed is faster than controller. We know that, you’ll lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxXFM0"&gt;Nothing has changed in the classic arguments between mouse and keyboard players and controllers. Xbox players simply want the option to be able to opt out of crossplay, and not to have to be forced to play against PC players. A lot of PC players would also like to avoid controller aim assist in games like &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBEwID"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; launched in November with forced crossplay for Xbox players, and an option to disable it for PlayStation owners. In a sign that things can change, Developer DICE was quick to &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-4"&gt;add the option&lt;/a&gt; to disable crossplay for Xbox players just a few weeks after launch. Even Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;, the original darling of crossplay, added an option to disable forced crossplay a few years after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKoWpb"&gt;We reached out to both Microsoft and Activision to comment on the forced crossplay situation, and neither company was willing to issue a statement in time for publication. 343 Industries, the developer behind &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite, &lt;/em&gt;made it clear it’s trying to address the cheating issues in the game yesterday. 343 is hoping to address &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/halo-infinite-update-btb-and-more-jan-10/490385?u=ske7ch"&gt;cheating and “other things”&lt;/a&gt; in a patch in mid-February. 343 won’t be magically fixing cheating issues from its game with a single patch, but here’s hoping there’s an option to avoid most of them next month.&lt;/p&gt;
