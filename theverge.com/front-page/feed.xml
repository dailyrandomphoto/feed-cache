    <title>GitHub says it will now operate in Iran after receiving sanction exemption</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O4CYlp"&gt;GitHub says it will now offer its full range of services in Iran, after imposing restrictions on the platform for Iranian developers due to US sanctions. The changes are due to an exemption granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the sanction enforcement arm of the US Treasury Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiDneC"&gt;“Today we are announcing a breakthrough: we have secured a license from the US government to offer GitHub to developers in Iran. This includes all services for individuals and organizations, private and public, free and paid,” GitHub CEO Nat Friedman wrote in a &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/"&gt;blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. “Over the course of two years, we were able to demonstrate how developer use of GitHub advances human progress, international communication, and the enduring US foreign policy of promoting free speech and the free flow of information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmqPyu"&gt;GitHub has been operating in a very limited form in Iran &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, mostly by making &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2019-09-12-global-software-collaboration-in-the-face-of-sanctions/"&gt;some public code repositories available&lt;/a&gt;, due to US trade restrictions that forced the Microsoft-owned open-source hosting site to similarly restrict its operations in Crimea and Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzQqPf"&gt;The company is now “in the process of rolling back all restrictions on developers in Iran” and “reinstating full access to affected accounts,” and Friedman says GitHub is working on receiving exemptions for Crimea and Syria, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is pausing its 3G shutdown indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yc-MECnplWZx7mqEH4gntj_KZC8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623912/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQDhUA"&gt;Verizon is indefinitely delaying the shutdown of its 3G network, pushing back the original plan for the network to shutter at the end of 2020 to an as-yet-undetermined point in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VjPhE"&gt;The news comes from Verizon spokesperson Kevin King, who &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbss/verizon-indefinitely-delays-3g-network-shutdown/d/d-id/766399?_mc=RSS_LR_EDT"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Our 3G network is operational and we don’t have a plan to shut it down at this time. We’ll work with customers to move them to newer technology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qLqyX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;, Verizon previously announced that it planned to shutter the 3G network at the end of 2020, which was already a delay. (The company originally intended to close the network at the end of 2019.) Now, it seems that Verizon is once again punting that decision down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKZsQA"&gt;The interesting part of this decision is that Verizon is making it solely for customers who are still using their existing 3G devices. The company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Fknowledge-base-218813%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F5%2F22215453%2Fverizon-3g-shutdown-paused-delay-network-old-phones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no longer allows&lt;/a&gt; customers to activate new 3G phones on its network (as of 2018), nor does it offer prepaid 3G service (as of 2019). Obviously, Verizon would prefer that its customers upgrade to new 4G LTE — or, at this point, 5G — plans (presumably with new phones that they’ll buy through the carrier). But the repeated delays in shutting down the 3G network seem to suggest that the transition isn’t going as fast as the company would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OhRse"&gt;Verizon isn’t the only network working to move customers off of its legacy 3G network. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;recently advised&lt;/a&gt; its customers using 3G phones that it plans to shut down its 3G network sometime in early 2022, while T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;reportedly looking&lt;/a&gt; to make voice over LTE (VoLTE) a requirement early this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patents point to using your MacBook to wirelessly charge your iPhone and Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euw_dZeUrJ1Mf86nWNmC3Rx8HtQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623907/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8wxBfg"&gt;Apple has been granted two patents that describe adding two-way wireless charging to its devices (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/macbook-wirelessly-charging/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The patents, first &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/01/apple-has-been-granted-a-pair-of-2-way-charging-patents-for-a-future-macbook-pro-that-could-recharge-idevices-and-more.html"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Patently Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include drawings that show a MacBook charging various devices, including an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as drawings of iPads and iPhones doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzIN8M"&gt;If this sounds familiar, it’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21353196/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-price-release-date-camera-stylus-specs"&gt;many other phone makers&lt;/a&gt; have released devices with similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;reverse wireless charging technology&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple’s take is a little different. According to the patent images, a MacBook’s lid, palm rest, or trackpad could be used to charge a wireless charging-compatible iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3fZqL9Bx3Qcb2pcKVmaX8Zpjw8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215615/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.24.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patent shows a future MacBook device charging an iPhone and Apple Watch, though this configuration would make it tricky to use the computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHiKgL"&gt;The problem the patents claim to solve is the one where you may find yourself without enough outlets, power bricks, or any electricity at all. The patents state that “despite having standardized connectors and cable[s], each device may require a separate or dedicated power supply to charge. In some cases, having separate power supplies for each device may be burdensome to use, store, and/or transport.” (Of course, having separate power bricks for your devices is also made more difficult &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455726/apple-removes-charging-brick-watch-edition-hermes-model-environment"&gt;when they aren’t included in the box&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3oI461NOFoIxv3TBWA_gwrOc9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215618/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.25.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This figure showing devices being charged on a MacBook’s lid suggests that you could use your laptop as a wireless charging pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fkWgSd"&gt;There are other times when this kind of tech could be useful. For example, if you’re away from a charger and your Apple Watch or AirPods die, it’d be useful to be able to top them up with your phone. Likewise, being able to charge your phone from your laptop would be useful, and if Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515789/apple-portless-iphone-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;truly heading toward a portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, this type of tech could be a way to retain that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrY6TH"&gt;Right now, MacBooks and iPads are made out of aluminum, which isn’t compatible with wireless charging. If Apple wants to include this reverse wireless charging tech in its devices, it’ll have to design around that limitation. (Maybe it could bring back a plastic MacBook?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmqvby"&gt;It’s also hard to avoid thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple’s ill-fated AirPower project&lt;/a&gt; when considering the idea of a MacBook or iPad filled with wireless charging coils that are able to charge multiple devices at once. To be fair, Apple’s tech has progressed since then, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;now has control of the processors in all of its devices&lt;/a&gt;. It may come up with some solution to help the devices communicate and power levels and thermal constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZ1rVy"&gt;Whether you’ll actually be able to use your MacBook as a wireless charging pad for all of your devices remains to be seen, but I’d at least like to see this tech come to the iPhone. Many of its competitors already have some sort of reverse wireless charging capability, and while it’d be great to see it cranked up to 11 like in the below patent drawing, I’d be happy with Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;catching up with the competition at this point&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537855/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-reverse-wireless-charging-fcc-filings-hidden"&gt;it seems like the iPhone 12 has the hardware to do this&lt;/a&gt;, it’s currently not enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67J1i_C_OYBK5-TLfwvSxgrh8VY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215621/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.25.23_AM.png"&gt;

    <title>Best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2021 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2021. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="L8pJhA"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: HP Envy x360 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-3n_PDQBp_EOIUDusfA7A_LYGZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20069599/mchin_200705_4086_0006.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UnaYvt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505904"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;The 2-in-1 laptop to buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best Windows clamshell you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ff7WtW"&gt;A gorgeous 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BGSdq5"&gt;The Spectre x360 is a premium-level 2-in-1 Windows laptop with the latest processor options from Intel, a vibrant touchscreen, and more port options than are found on other laptops in this segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL9pqG"&gt;The x360 weighs less than three pounds and is about two-thirds of an inch thick when closed, which makes it very easy to travel with. The latest model has a smaller footprint than before, thanks to shrunken bezels above and below the screen, but it still maintains a full-size keyboard and spacious trackpad. In addition, it provides both facial and fingerprint biometric authentication, so you can choose which way you prefer to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQyU1"&gt;HP updated the trackpad drivers it uses in the latest model to Microsoft’s Precision set and the experience is improved over the older versions to the point where it’s no longer an issue. The x360’s trackpad is now right up there with the best Windows trackpad options (which are still a tick behind what you get on a MacBook) in terms of scrolling, multifinger gestures, and palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msO0V8"&gt;The biggest argument against the x360 is that it has a 16:9 display, as opposed to the 16:10 or 3:2 screens you’ll find on Dell or Microsoft’s computers. Those taller aspect ratios are much better for productivity work, whether that’s working in two documents side by side or researching on the web without having to scroll as much. But unless you are very particular about your screen’s aspect ratio, most people won’t find this to be a deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="04pBWK"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 15 is one of the best laptops for video editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telaZa"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE proves that you don’t need to break the bank for a great gaming experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xLW8VK"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wonder Woman 1984 and Hamilton’s three biggest lessons for streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeDu-y8b_GzC_r7jru4flJADp64=/0x0:1680x1120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623577/ww84.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="avXMD1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were two of 2020’s biggest films — at least where streaming was concerned. Recent third-party data suggests both releases drove crowds of subscribers to their streaming platforms (HBO Max and Disney Plus, respectively). More than any other movies that debuted online this year, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;drove the most initial signups, according to new data from research firm Antenna. Data from research firm Screen Engine &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wonder-woman-1984-shows-promise-for-hbo-max-audience-survey-finds"&gt;found similar results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hf1GoP"&gt;But digging into the data shows the successes of both releases are more complicated than they look. Unlike a conventional box office release, streaming success is measured not just in how many people saw the movie, but in how many people stuck around afterward. Measuring that success is much harder, but with this lesson, three new rules of the streaming game are already becoming clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtQjO6"&gt;Blockbuster releases drive immediate signups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uFXTTP"&gt;This one is kind of obvious, but it’s nice to see it spelled out in the data. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;led the pack for the most signups over a film’s opening weekend on streaming services, with &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;generating 71 percent as much and &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;35 percent as much. Although, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;was HBO Max’s first major release, while &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;premiered after &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. (Its overall weekend signup numbers may be lower because people already had Disney Plus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng7o8P"&gt;Determining the value of “biggest” on streaming platforms is complicated. Neither WarnerMedia (HBO Max’s parent company) nor Disney shares data for their films’ performances. While those numbers would allow reporters and analysts to see total subscriber numbers and determine how much a single movie drives in subscription revenue, they’re not the most important figures. (It’s also difficult to translate streaming success into box office performance as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526664/netflix-movies-billion-dollar-box-office-blockbuster-ted-sarandos-earnings"&gt;there are too many variables&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;’s domestic box office revenue in the film’s subsequent weeks following its initial &lt;a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/wonder-woman-1984-box-office-second-weekend/"&gt;release is far from phenomenal&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i9vGJ0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big movies bring in subscribers, but do they keep them? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WriCEY"&gt;Blockbuster releases don’t always lead to long-term subscriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fbnpoO"&gt;Getting people to sign up is one thing; keeping them is another. Arguably, keeping them is also the most important part. Think of the United States. Once the majority of households have signed up for a service, it’s much tougher to continue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21142065/netflix-streaming-wars-subscriber-growth-disney-international"&gt;growing at scale in that region&lt;/a&gt;. What becomes more important than growing in that territory is convincing people to stay. Recurring revenue only makes sense if companies can convince the majority of their customers to continuously pay month after month, year after year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1QmfM"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;drew in the most subscribers per single title on Disney Plus in 2020, the drop-off rate was higher than average Disney Plus subscribers who signed up for the service before the movie came out. Nearly a quarter of people who signed up for Disney Plus during &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;’s opening weekend canceled within 30 days, according to Antenna. After three months, less than 60 percent of that same subscriber group remained. Comparatively, about 70 percent of people who signed up for Disney Plus in June (about four weeks ahead of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;’s premiere) remained subscribed three months later. This doesn’t imply that Disney Plus is in trouble — the platform had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;nearly 90 million subscribers in mid-December&lt;/a&gt; — but it speaks to the necessity of consistency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjJMzr"&gt;Streaming’s beauty is also a problem to solve: it’s extremely easy for people to sign up, and it’s even easier for people to cancel. While big titles bring in subscribers, it doesn’t necessarily mean people are going to stay subscribed. Take &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;: if people are signing up specifically for the filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway musical, they may not be as interested in staying for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; or Marvel films and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAYMfo"&gt;This group of subscribers is important for Disney, as they represent an audience Disney hasn’t already tapped into — but it’s a double-edged sword, as they’re more likely to cancel. People signing up ahead of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, however, may watch &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;when it lands on top of the other Disney properties they initially signed up to watch, but it’s not why they signed up. Figuring out how to keep both groups happy is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NYxx7E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Streaming’s beauty is also a problem to solve: it’s extremely easy for people to sign up and even easier for people to cancel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KGYfCL"&gt;Retention depends on what else is in your catalog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jRxbrZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;is a more interesting case. It’s too early to tell if people are readily canceling their HBO Max subscriptions after watching &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, but the type of plan customers are purchasing does provide some insight. While more than 80 percent of people who signed up for Disney Plus to watch &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;chose the monthly subscription offering instead of annual plans (compared to 69 percent of average Disney Plus subscribers who signed up in June), roughly the same number of customers signed up for HBO Max’s monthly subscription as the six-month plan, according to Antenna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcBael"&gt;There are a couple of reasons this may be the case — including that WarnerMedia offered a cheaper pricing option for the six-month tier ahead of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;’s release — but it also speaks to WarnerMedia’s wider plan. Just before &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;came out, WarnerMedia announced that every single Warner Bros. movie in 2021 will be released on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO Max the same day titles&lt;/a&gt; premiere in theaters. Every month, there will be a “theatrical release” available at home for HBO Max subscribers. That’s on top of new HBO shows, a library of popular movies and TV series, and HBO Max originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wIgmW"&gt;WarnerMedia provided &lt;em&gt;a good reason to keep the subscription&lt;/em&gt;. The same is true for customers who signed up for Disney Plus for &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;’s release. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, customers who signed up for Disney Plus during &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;’s opening weekend bought annual plans on par with those who purchased monthly plans. This comes just after Disney’s massive streaming-focused investor day, where executives touted a number of titles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;coming to Disney Plus in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Like WarnerMedia’s HBO Max announcement, Disney gave people a reason to hold on to their subscriptions and return to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CiQJGO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WarnerMedia provided a good reason to keep the subscription&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OteFM6"&gt;Streaming success is a balancing act of acquisition and retention. Subscription streaming is a valuable play for media and entertainment conglomerates because of its recurring revenue. That only happens if customers are routinely happy with a mix of new titles and an impressive library. See: Netflix. Netflix has the lowest churn rate (a term used to describe cancel rates) of any subscriber. There are enough new titles and a concrete enough library to justify increasingly expensive subscription costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOmVsZ"&gt;2021 is an important year for streamers like HBO Max and Disney Plus. Each company has its own strategy, but the biggest takeaway from 2020’s streaming bets is something they both share: people want new things all the time. And with more places to get entertainment than ever before, each company needs to fight to keep their attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSP2qG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uq26o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nH1T7e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your video background in Microsoft Teams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Teams stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_9uKpjz3H5m0memBr8NZA6m1u10=/0x0:2502x1668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623559/microsoftteamsstock.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jMcxpf"&gt;While Zoom remains popular for its ease of use and features such as the ability to pop in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173608/zoom-video-conference-how-to-virtual-background-greenscreen"&gt;different backgrounds&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not the only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"&gt;video meeting app&lt;/a&gt; out there that lets you do those things. For example, Microsoft’s Teams office communications app also allows you to tweak your meeting background. Here, we’ll show you how to change your background for a Teams videoconference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xsxd5i"&gt;If you want to select a background before you officially begin the meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UnFKTN"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285118/meeting-microsoft-teams-schedule-video-call-group"&gt;Start your Teams video meeting&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll find yourself at the intermediate screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6pdXu"&gt;Make sure that video is toggled on in the button bar near the bottom of the screen, then toggle on the background settings control (located between the video and audio controls)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pJm16k"&gt;A “Background settings” column will appear on the right. Use that to blur your real background or choose from several different images to provide a false background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose a new Teams background from the “Background settings” window" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_fDwW1cieS5A1hmvVF13txecs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215492/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_1.19.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a new Teams background from the “Background settings” window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QVRLlT"&gt;If you want to add your own image, click the “Add new” link at the top of the column. You can then choose an image from your computer’s files, which will be added to the available backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNycRF"&gt;When you do change your background, the change will stay in effect through your other meetings until you change it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zgPgLI"&gt;If you’ve already started the meeting (or you’ve joined somebody else’s meeting), you can still change your background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="L9PmA6"&gt;Click on the three dots in the middle of the button bar at the bottom of the screen and select “Show background effects.” You’ll get the same “Background settings” column on the right, with the same ability to blur your background, change it, or add a new one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can preview your background before using it" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yIYtDGy9D_OtPbjK-R-_ZOGw8BI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215496/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_1.22.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preview your background before using it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e4jGrh"&gt;If you’re in the middle of a meeting and want to test the background, click on “Preview” in the “Background settings” column. You’ll be able to see the effect in a small window at the bottom of the column; nobody else in your meeting will see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bjsHS2"&gt;Once you’re happy with your new background, click on “Apply” (or just select “Stop preview” if you want to go back to your previous background)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pdiq0u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 5th, 2021, 2:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 14th, 2020, and has been changed to include updates in the software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon just bought a bunch of used commercial jets for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Air Boeing 737" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNEp1LC5ICa4mZapNUqM8FBfbrA=/0x0:4600x3067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623267/1155787631.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awEbXi"&gt;Amazon announced it purchased 11 used Boeing 767-300 jets from Delta and WestJet, a first for the e-commerce giant. The company has been steadily building up its air cargo capacity over the years through leasing agreements, but this is the first time Amazon has ever owned its own aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqyND2"&gt;The deal comes as airplane prices have dropped due to the coronavirus pandemic. Airlines have been rushing to shrink their fleets as passenger demand plummets amid lockdown orders across the globe. The purchases include seven aircraft from Delta and four aircraft from WestJet, which will join Amazon’s network by 2022, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJvAxa"&gt;“Our goal is to continue delivering for customers across the U.S. in the way that they expect from Amazon, and purchasing our own aircraft is a natural next step toward that goal,” said Sarah Rhoads, vice president of Amazon Global Air, &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-continues-expand-its-transportation-fleet-purchased"&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Having a mix of both leased and owned aircraft in our growing fleet allows us to better manage our operations, which in turn helps us to keep pace in meeting our customer promises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hrebnL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon launched its air fleet in 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2ebzW"&gt;Amazon launched its air fleet in 2016, under the assumption that by 2022 it will have more than 85 planes, both leased and owned. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020938/amazon-logistics-prime-air-fedex-ups-package-delivery-more-than-50-percent"&gt;According to a year-old analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon delivers more than half of all of its packages in the US as it accelerates its push to own the entire logistics chain and end its relationship with companies like FedEx and UPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6OB4o"&gt;The newly bought planes are intended to help speed the delivery of packages purchased through Amazon, which has seen record demand as a result of the pandemic. The company says it will continue to rely on third-party carriers to operate these new aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT1Rrm"&gt;Amazon is quickly becoming a major player in the world of transportation. Obviously, as one of the largest delivery and logistics firms in history, Amazon was always destined to play a huge role in the way people and things move across the globe. But some of the company’s more recent deals suggest Jeff Bezos’ company has ambitions that extend beyond just package delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQY5VH"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304111/amazon-zoox-acquisition-self-driving-car-autonomous-vehicles-startup-robotaxi-bi-directional-vehicle"&gt;recently acquired&lt;/a&gt; the self-driving car startup Zoox, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;unveiled its omnidirectional prototype robotaxi&lt;/a&gt;. The company has also participated in multiple funding rounds for electric vehicle company Rivian, which is designing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;battery-powered van&lt;/a&gt; for the delivery giant’s last-mile deliveries, and contributed to driverless car and truck startup Aurora’s $530 million funding round. (Aurora just acquired Uber’s self-driving car division.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ASu8s"&gt;And of course there’s the company’s interest in drone delivery. The company was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408646/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-clearance-approval-health-safety-alphabet-wing"&gt;given approval by the Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; to operate as a drone airline in the US, paving the way for it to start offering commercial deliveries on a trial basis. The FAA said that the ruling allows Amazon to “safely and efficiently deliver packages to customers” and let its drones carry packages outside of the operator’s visual line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjyJKP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s latest sport earbuds won’t block out the outside world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZ1UUvv6SAgxQYP-b4UDzCQyWTo=/1x0:2989x1992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623026/Bose_Sport_Open_Earbuds__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;By sitting above rather than inside the ear, the earbuds let you hear what’s going on in your environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bose&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUuqXR"&gt;Bose’s latest true wireless earbuds, the Sport Open Earbuds, are designed to keep you aware of your surroundings while you listen. While most other earbuds sit inside the ear canal, blocking out at least some ambient noise, the Sport Open Earbuds instead sit outside it. Bose has officially announced the earbuds a little over a month after their existence was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150405/bose-sport-open-earbuds-fcc-leak-photos"&gt;leaked via a Federal Communications Commission filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gwAyD"&gt;A design that lets in ambient noise might sound unintuitive, given how headphone manufacturers (including Bose) spend so much money trying to do the exact opposite with noise-canceling tech. But there are plenty of instances where being aware of your surroundings is a very good thing, like when you’re cycling through traffic or going on a run after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_JtjgpHeVo7S4aXBWiuiVrn_k4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215377/Bose_Sport_Open_Earbuds.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds charge via an included charging base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RjHNLC"&gt;Different headphone manufacturers have used a variety of approaches to achieve a similar effect. For example, bone conduction headphones, like those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706156/aftershokz-aeropex-bone-conduction-headphones-wireless-review"&gt;produced by Aftershokz&lt;/a&gt;, vibrate against the sides of the wearer’s head, allowing them to hear music without having earbuds in their ears. It’s also becoming common for earbuds like the AirPods Pro to include some kind of “ambient” or “transparency” mode, where they use their microphones to hear ambient noise and mix it with music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P28NqS"&gt;Bose’s approach is a little different. Rather than sitting inside the ear like most earbuds, the Sport Open Earbuds “gently grip the ear’s outer ridge” and sit above the ear canal. Bose claims this allows them to work with “no ear tip, virtually no skin contact, and without the squeezing and vibrations from bone conduction.” It adds that only the wearer should hear what the earbuds are playing, even at high volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZMqiQ"&gt;In terms of specs, Bose is promising the earbuds will provide eight hours of battery life on a charge, have a dust and water resistance rating of IPX4, and support Bluetooth 5.1. They can be controlled with a button on each earbud (one for activating a paired phone’s voice assistant and one for controlling playback), and there are microphones built into them for making calls. They come with a carrying case and charging base and can be controlled with the Bose Music App. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y9UMY"&gt;Bose is only releasing the Sport Open Earbuds in the US for now, where they’re available in black and retail for $199.95. Preorders open today, and the earbuds will be available starting in mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what we know about the Google union so far</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJgXuur0NZi0aDpmT9R7-3XRHv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622963/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lTXnOp"&gt;On Monday, roughly 230 Google employees announced they were forming a union with the Communication Workers of America (CWA). It’s open to employees and contractors at Alphabet, Google’s parent company. As a minority union, it doesn’t need to go through a formal legal process in order to exist. It just needs to announce itself. That part is done. World, meet the &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/"&gt;Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhNlj6"&gt;The news prompted a wave of support from organizers like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1346125551539548162"&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1346120251109359618"&gt;Ellen Pao&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346050124544233473"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. It also led to some questions. What is a minority union? Isn’t 230 members rather small? Why is CWA involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bj902G"&gt;Here’s what we know so far about the Alphabet Workers Union — and what we are still waiting to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSLnao"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did this union come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSF6gX"&gt;Over the past three years, Google employees have been organizing major walkouts and protests to oppose the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire"&gt;work with the Pentagon on targeted drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;pay former executive Andy Rubin $90 million after he was credibly accused of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-s-project-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-triggers-protests-n960121"&gt;design a censored search engine for China&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, employees have stood up against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Google’s firing of prominent AI ethicist Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;. Now, union organizers want to unite all of those efforts under a single umbrella. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWalkout/status/1346104231938416641"&gt;The Google Walkout Twitter account is publicly supporting AWU&lt;/a&gt;, although the efforts aren’t one and the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmrDRj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a minority union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRNThA"&gt;As a minority union, or a solidarity union, AWU doesn’t need to go through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and hold a vote to convince the majority of employees to sign on. With the announcement, “Google workers are taking immediate advantage of the power of a union,” &lt;a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/"&gt;according to Clarissa Redwine in Collective Action in Tech&lt;/a&gt;. This structure puts the emphasis on employee organizing, rather than politics and negotiations, which can come later. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html#click=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2Fm2Qmjwz32V"&gt;Workers told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it was “primarily an effort to give structure and longevity to activism at Google, rather than to negotiate for a contract.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3ji3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the benefit of that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGyGYU"&gt;The structure allows AWU to welcome Alphabet contractors as well as employees. At Google, temporary workers outnumber full-time staff but often receive just a small fraction of the benefits. AWU wants to unite the interests of janitors and cafeteria workers with those of engineers and product managers. This would be difficult to do with a majority union. “Organizing Google as a labor union via existing labor laws would be next to impossible,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at Hastings. “Google would have so many advantages to avoiding recognizing any kind of majority union.” Dubal also says that Google’s use of temporary workers is likely strategic. “We can understand Google’s use of temporary workers as part of their effort to avoid unionism,” she says. “It’s an effort to divide workers, and avoid having to work with the majority bargaining unit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5fxSI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else like this in tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lipmsy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/"&gt;As Redwine wrote&lt;/a&gt;, this isn’t the first time Google workers have unionized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pbay2z"&gt;In 2017, Security guards at Google and Facebook had their union recognized and fought through a long contract negotiation. In 2019, Google cafeteria staff employed by vendor Bon Appetit won their union election. In September 2019 a group of 80 contract office workers in Pittsburgh voted to join the United Steelworkers, forming Google’s very first office worker union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mSSVEG"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;workers at Kickstarter unionized&lt;/a&gt;, too, becoming the “first union comprised of white-collar, full-time employees in the technology industry,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;according to April Glaser at NBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Kw2s"&gt;But Kickstarter is a small company with fewer than 200 employees. Google, in contrast, has 123,000 full-time staff and more than 130,000 contractors, making AWU’s effort unprecedented. If it’s successful, it will likely be a bellwether for organizing efforts at big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc2w5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Communication Workers of America?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9car8"&gt;CWA is one of the largest unions in the US, with 700,000 members. It was formed by telecom workers but has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055445/game-workers-union-cwa-union-partnership-tech-video-games-organizing"&gt;branched out into game developers&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, tech employees. The Google union is affiliated with &lt;a href="https://www.code-cwa.org/"&gt;CWA’s Coalition to Organize Digital Employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9WbXr"&gt;Google employees organized in secret for almost a year before deciding to go public with the support of CWA. As a minority union, it doesn’t need the backing of a larger organization. Part of the point, after all, is to avoid the bureaucracy that comes from working with a big institution. But CWA’s experience will likely come in handy when going up against Google management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBym8O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And people like CWA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrwJlG"&gt;Not everyone is happy about CWA’s involvement. Amr Gaber, an engineer who helped organize the Google walkouts in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the organization was “more concerned about claiming turf” than listening to the needs of workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8swzrE"&gt;Kathryn Spiers, a security engineer who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;wrongfully fired from Google in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, according to the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/computerfemme/status/1346144349218889728"&gt;wrote that CWA has&lt;/a&gt; “a tendency to jump the gun and announce things early (they put my name in a press release without my permission) and this feels similar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsyuuE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are the goals of the union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57yP17"&gt;AWU hasn’t published a list of demands. As a democratic organization, it wants to hear from new members before deciding on major initiatives. But organizers have hinted that they’re not stopping at pay disparity. “Our goal with the union is to ensure that tech companies use their technology to make the world a better place,” says Alan Morales, a Google engineer and AWU organizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nLqSV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a union with only a few hundred members be effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGabhR"&gt;The short answer is probably not — but AWU isn’t expecting to stay at just a few hundred. When the union went public, it had about 230 members. Less than 24 hours later, it has more than 400. Organizers anticipate the membership base will continue to swell. “We are expecting more members over the few coming weeks, now that the union is public, possibly in the thousands,” Morales says. Still, with roughly a quarter of a million Google workers, AWU has a long way to go to reach a critical mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ao62Zi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We started today with 200+ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AWU&lt;/a&gt; members, the result of more than a year of intense discussions, one-on-one's, &amp;amp; other organizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We ended today, our first day as a public group, with over 400 members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the first Monday of 2021. We're going to keep it up this whole year.&lt;/p&gt;— Alphabet Workers Union (@AlphabetWorkers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346254041714593792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9dtxM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has Google responded to the union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcyHSR"&gt;Google issued a statement yesterday saying “of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support.” But if AWU continues to grow, the company will likely change its tune. Google already &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;hired IRI consultants&lt;/a&gt;, a firm widely known for its anti-union sentiment, in 2019 in the wake of employee organizing efforts. That same year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;fired four workers who were engaged in employee activism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlCbgG"&gt;This time around, “it’s not necessarily going to be as clear cut as firing individual activists,” says Liz Fong-Jones, a former Google engineer. “Yes, they will continue to fire individual activists, but I think the more likely thing is that activists will face negative performance reviews, being told that they’re not team players or that they’re not positive about the company. We saw some of those things with Dr. Timnit Gebru.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkFr4E"&gt;That’s going to be especially true if the union starts going after major strategy initiatives, like the company’s government contracts. But that’s also kind of the point. Meredith Whittaker, one of the organizers of the 2018 Google walkout, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “I’m not interested in a movement about what kind of tea workers have in the free snack kitchen. This is a fight for power over everything at Google — what they build, how they treat people, whether certain parts of the company should exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjJihS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Google employees. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft commits to fix Xbox Series X controller disconnects in a future update</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jFSs1HlgvWHx2bWdg3O3bk_Nk5Y=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622942/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3632_2_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDG3Gl"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; feels like a huge PC-like upgrade for your Xbox games, but a fraction of buyers have been experiencing an unusual &lt;em&gt;downgrade&lt;/em&gt; as well — the new Xbox Series X gamepad doesn’t seem to stay connected to the console in some games and some situations, &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_console/xbox-series-x-controller-keeps-disconnecting/16d9f462-57c0-4b6c-93fd-b03711e632ee?page=1"&gt;according to a 40-page thread in Microsoft’s help forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7x2hp"&gt;The good news: Microsoft knows about the issue, and a fix is on the way. “We are aware some players may be experiencing disconnects with their new Xbox Wireless Controllers and our teams are actively working on a solution to be included in a future update,” a company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SfQc1"&gt;Again, it’s not clear how widespread this issue truly is — though nearly 1,700 co-signers on a 40-page forum post is enough to show it’s definitely a concern, that’s a tiny fraction of the million-plus units these consoles &lt;a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/446290/xbox-series-x-and-s-sold-an-estimated-12-to-14-million-units-on-launch-day/"&gt;were estimated to have sold at launch&lt;/a&gt;. And some of those reporting the issue say it only happens in certain games, &lt;em&gt;like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as you’ll see if you read through the forum or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/jsj02i/series_x_controller_disconnecting/"&gt;Reddit threads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J0khW"&gt;Even a couple of the video clips we’ve seen of the issue don’t seem to necessarily be showing off the same problem: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/k3737h/xbox_series_x_controller_disconnecting/"&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt; is a controller that doesn’t seem to be syncing to the console at all, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjallemand/status/1344461330997252099"&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt; is paired but not successfully sending inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My kingdom for a Xbox controller that doesn’t disconnect at random. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NBfubjWnC5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NBfubjWnC5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Milton Allemand (@mjallemand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjallemand/status/1344461330997252099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naggvq"&gt;Either way, it sounds like Microsoft will sort it out. And if you’re experiencing controller disconnects on a Windows PC over Bluetooth (rather than an Xbox console), there may already be a fix for that. &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/known-issues-on-xbox-series-xs/221c9d7f-dc91-4067-ba81-33ab671179b5"&gt;There’s a Windows Update you can download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0cfBE"&gt;Here’s the company’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mKWlFS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Microsoft, we put all of our products through rigorous quality assurance testing and are committed to providing customers with an unparalleled gaming experience. We are aware some players may be experiencing disconnects with their new Xbox Wireless Controllers and our teams are actively working on a solution to be included in a future update. For the best experience, we encourage customers to update to the latest controller firmware by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.xbox.com%2Fhelp%2Fhardware-network%2Fcontroller%2Fupdate-xbox-wireless-controller&amp;amp;data=04%7C01%7Cnatalie.edwards%40edelman.com%7Cacd6747ab5b940a3cbdd08d8b1989a51%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637454616274265844%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;amp;sdata=c1MfSUl1YP3Kvh0BgU%2BlXqPh34gJ5WI2%2F0bm9jd9Vf0%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;following the steps posted here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or visiting &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2F&amp;amp;data=04%7C01%7Cnatalie.edwards%40edelman.com%7Cacd6747ab5b940a3cbdd08d8b1989a51%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637454616274275837%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;amp;sdata=3TrDfUuh0iLWQKhwCGyjyzedzYD1J40QMyx8Hv4i%2BLI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;https://support.xbox.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for assistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
