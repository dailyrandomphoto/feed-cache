    <title>AMC is giving free popcorn away to meme stonk investors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Burbank Exteriors And Landmarks - 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3bbvln3lxtli5isHtUekMKtcG3c=/0x74:3100x2141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378775/1231701895.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X73aOx"&gt;Look, when the internet learns a new trick — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;like it did in January, with GameStop&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a pretty safe bet that people will play the trick again. So AMC is through the roof right now: it touched $72.62, a 91 percent increase from its open and an all-time high. That’s because AMC has embraced the trolls, and now the stock price is going &lt;em&gt;brrr&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvcXNt"&gt;AMC &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921075395/tm2117897d3_defa14a.htm"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it was creating AMC Investor Connect, “an innovative, proactive communication initiative that will put AMC in direct communication with its extraordinary base of enthusiastic and passionate individual shareholders to keep them up to date about important company information and to provide them with special offers.” This represents “a groundbreaking new approach” to communicating with retail investors, the company says. It’s a shame they didn’t put a bunch of rocket emojis in the announcement — after all, there’s no need to be coy. We all know exactly who AMC is speaking to, and if they sign up today, they’re getting free popcorn. &lt;em&gt;I can’t make this shit up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="am9aGt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;lol nothing matters money is made up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GtdiwP"&gt;This is also, essentially, the opposite of what GameStop did, which was &lt;em&gt;say absolutely nothing&lt;/em&gt;. You got the sense that maybe the exec team was nervous that anything they said might potentially be securities fraud. AMC, though, they’ve elected to really embrace the whole meme thing. I’m hoping there are more announcements where they get meme-ier. Like, retail investors get a free Lego rocket in the fourth quarter or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzsKg2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/meme-insider/weekend-meme-roundup-explaining-the-lingo-and-memes-of-wallstreetbets-and-the-gamestop-stock-surge"&gt;The apes&lt;/a&gt; of r/WallStreetBets have been good to AMC. The in-person theater company had been suffering due to the coronavirus — but the r/WallStreetBets excitement in January  &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921008352/tm213880d2_8k.htm"&gt;essentially wiped out $600 million of debt by&lt;/a&gt; letting the holders convert them into stock. Meme enthusiasm essentially &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/02/amc-wallstreetbets-stock-debt/"&gt;saved the company&lt;/a&gt;. (AMC &lt;a href="https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Raises-917-Million-of-Fresh-Investment-Capital-Since-Mid-December-of-2020/default.aspx"&gt;also issued new stock&lt;/a&gt; because why not. “Apes together strong,” as they say at WallStreetBets!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZE7T1"&gt;A lot of the meme stocks are shooting up again. CNBC even has a “meme stock” graphic now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Meme Stocks” chart from CNBC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7VLgJRWTeHQQ9weHhVVpzWnQ1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555337/E24_NrSWYAAhODE.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ooooh, a CNBC graphic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d0S1WN"&gt;Meme trading didn’t originate with stocks — it’s a strategy jump. You know what trades heavily on memes? Cryptocurrency! (You remember “HODL,” right?) And you know what makes you go &lt;em&gt;lol nothing matters money is made up&lt;/em&gt;? Also cryptocurrency! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXfc8z"&gt;It was probably inevitable that traders would bring cryptocurrency’s nihilistic insights to the broader market. This real question is what the finance normals plan to do about it. Like, you can make cute little risk models and fill out your Excel spreadsheets, but how do you take into account the possibility that a roving band of irony-poisoned redditors &lt;em&gt;can blow you up at any minute?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7p55tk"&gt;You could say, “Hey, this is bull-market exuberance.” You could also say, “Hey, interest rates are effectively zero right now so there’s a lot of money sloshing around.” Those things are true and they help. But what the internet learned in January is that it can meme stocks into going up, and some people will make money when that happens, and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop it. It &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-26/will-wallstreetbets-face-sec-scrutiny-after-gamestop-rally-kke9fpzq"&gt;may not even be fraud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;because no one is lying.&lt;/em&gt; This started somewhere, and that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-06/crypto-pumps-are-just-for-fun?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;somewhere was cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, when you bring this strategy to the broader market, you can also potentially fuck over a bunch of big, serious companies, which makes the trolling &lt;em&gt;even more fun&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvotj1"&gt;Anyway, I hope the AMC investors enjoy their popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Cards are still having issues more than 5 hours later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4n0npO9Hc_laGzjqgNIRTMSivI=/201x0:2349x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377427/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.49.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPBOUA"&gt;The Apple Card is experiencing an outage today that may affect your ability to make payments, manage your card, and see recent transactions, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fsystemstatus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F2%2F22465000%2Fapple-card-outage-cant-make-payments-recent-transactions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s status page&lt;/a&gt;. Interruption in service appears to have started at 6:17AM PT today and is still ongoing five hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J5kgD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18277417/apple-pay-credit-card-announcement-goldman-sachs-event-2019"&gt;Apple’s credit card solution&lt;/a&gt; is managed almost entirely through the built-in Wallet app in iOS, where users can pay off their credit card bill, see recent transactions, and make payments through Apple Pay. Apple says that all users are affected by today’s outage, though it’s not clear if every user will experience all of the possible issues the company has reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jd8AY4"&gt;My colleague Mitchell Clark was able to pay off a portion of their bill and see the transaction show up in the Wallet app, so it’s possible the outage is slowly being fixed, or might not be as widespread as Apple warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCZcu2"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple for more information and will update if we learn more or the outage ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1n6ui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 2nd, 2:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Apple Card usage and updated the duration of the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX signs bulk deal for three private Crew Dragon missions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fEsYslv2Pz-luC3XRjdku0f4f6w=/162x0:1887x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378487/51117111424_a170f2cf95_k.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule is seen docked to the ISS in April, 2021 after a port relocation manuever with its crew of four Crew-1 astronauts on board. | NASA/JSC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oJwkQ"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule will launch three more private astronaut missions tentatively through 2023 under a bulk deal signed this week with mission manager Axiom Space, the companies announced on Wednesday. Though specific terms weren’t disclosed, it marks one of the biggest deals yet in the burgeoning private spaceflight industry and makes for a busy ISS schedule for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87xQTD"&gt;The three missions, paced roughly six months apart, will come after Axiom’s first ride on Crew Dragon in January next year flying an “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;all-civilian&lt;/a&gt;” crew to the International Space Station for eight days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451779/nasa-astronaut-peggy-whitson-axiom-space-private-iss-mission"&gt;Ax-2, the second mission&lt;/a&gt;, will be led by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson. Crews for Ax-3 and 4 haven’t been announced yet. All flights will involve similar stays on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJUMEP"&gt;Axiom declined to disclose the value of the agreement, which had been in the works for months and was officially signed with SpaceX in recent weeks. SpaceX didn’t return an email seeking comment. The timing and parameters of missions are subject to approval from NASA, which manages the ISS schedule, as well as a panel of NASA’s international space station partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FleHQU"&gt;“A new era in human spaceflight is here,” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said in a statement. “The growing partnership between Axiom and SpaceX will enable more opportunities for more humans in space on the road to making humanity multiplanetary,” SpaceX said of the Axiom deal on its website, referring to its founder Elon Musk’s main goal of colonizing Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it_Y9qQlMfJ4EI7YPy_VNnTVFI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555141/32376934667_bb5c9ed7f7_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / Joel Kowsky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule sits mounted atop a Falcon 9 rocket on the company’s 39A launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uP11nf"&gt;For Houston-based Axiom, founded in 2016 by veteran NASA ISS manager Mike Suffredini, these initial Crew Dragon treks to the space station will serve as “precursor missions” ahead of the company’s core project of building commercial ISS modules, the first of which is planned for installation in 2024. Suffredini, Axiom’s CEO, said these missions keep the company on track for those commercial space station plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09xC2P"&gt;“All four crews will receive combined commercial astronaut training from NASA and SpaceX, with SpaceX providing training on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, emergency preparedness training, spacesuit and spacecraft ingress and egress exercises, as well as partial and full simulations,” SpaceX’s statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeQTUz"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule was developed under a mix of private funds and a roughly $3 billion NASA contract in the agency’s Commercial Crew Program, which was started to revive America’s ability to launch crews to space from US soil after a decade-long dependence on Russian rockets. SpaceX has launched three crews of government astronauts under that program since May 2020, with four more planned in the future. Boeing, the second company under that program, is further behind with its Starliner capsule, which is slated to fly its first astronaut crew by year’s end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXa8ig"&gt;Adding four private Axiom-arranged Crew Dragon missions on top of SpaceX’s commercial crew cadence would make for a busy schedule for the ISS, which only has two docking ports that are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;compatible with Crew Dragon, a cargo-only version of Crew Dragon, and Boeing’s Starliner. With Starliner flights planned ahead, and NASA stating it allows only two private astronaut flights to the ISS per year, it’s unclear whether all four Axiom missions would get approved for flight through 2023. NASA didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6AVDI"&gt;“We continue to be extremely busy onboard the International Space Station,” NASA’s ISS program manager Joel Montalbano said Wednesday during a press conference on SpaceX’s cargo mission launching tomorrow. “NASA’s partnership with the commercial industry is changing the way we look at low Earth orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max’s cheaper $10 ad-supported plan is finally here </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwJFiXG_ZzVeuVhWnukT496wBqU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378412/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HBO Max logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nr4sZL"&gt;HBO Max’s ad-supported streaming option has officially launched on the platform. The new tier will be priced at $10 per month, which shaves $5 off HBO Max’s regular cost of $15 per month. How exactly HBO Max planned to successfully introduce ads on its premium content has been a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hbo-maxs-ad-plan-is-a-disaster-1844957510"&gt;bit of a head-scratcher&lt;/a&gt;, as premium and ad-free content was sort of the entire point of HBO to begin with. But to hear the company justify it, ads on the platform’s content will be both “elegant” and “respectful” of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOUrgW"&gt;“Advertising is a time-tested way to reduce the cost of great entertainment and reach a wider audience,” Andy Forssell, EVP and general manager at HBO Max, said in a statement. “We’ve worked hard to create an elegant, tasteful ad experience that is respectful of great storytelling for those users who choose it, and which we’re confident will deliver for our advertising partners as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqPxDg"&gt;While significantly cheaper, users who subscribe to this budget tier will be missing out on some of HBO Max’s more premium features. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21813364/wonder-woman-1984-4k-ultra-hd-dolby-vision-atmos-announced"&gt;introduced 4K streaming&lt;/a&gt; to its service last year with the premiere of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, but video quality on the budget tier will be capped at 1080p — much like Netflix does with its cheaper tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjlbaU"&gt;Additionally, titles will not be available for offline viewing on the more affordable plan, and users will lose the ability to access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;same-day movie premieres&lt;/a&gt; on the service. Subscribers will eventually be able to view these titles, just in the months after their theatrical release windows end. Everyone on the cheaper with-ads plan will have full access to the service’s originals, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKos2C"&gt;WarnerMedia said in a press release that ad time will be capped at a max of four minutes per hour. In addition, ads will not play on HBO originals — a smart move on WarnerMedia’s part if it hopes to maintain its relationships with high-profile talent and creators. The company said that as users continue using the service, “subscribers can expect to see greater personalization in the ads they do see with more innovation in formats to come.” The ad experience kicks off this month with more than 35 brands at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WszavM"&gt;Given that its originals are sort of the entire point of subscribing to the service, and taking into account the fact that these titles will remain free of ads, it’ll be interesting to see how HBO Max’s subscriber numbers change in the months ahead. I, for one, am looking forward to cutting $5 per month off my subscriptions tab now that I know I’ll be able to stream &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next God of War delayed until 2022 but will come to PS4 too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eks3XJAURJTE4NhAnPspSmZJvQM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378237/gow_screens_review_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="152qgb"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; game has been pushed to 2022. The game, intended for PS5, was originally planned to launch sometime in 2021. Head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst confirmed the news &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/02/hermen-hulst-qa-whats-next-for-playstation-studios/#sf246401757"&gt;in a post shared on the PlayStation blog&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’ve made the decision to push that game out to next year, to ensure that Santa Monica Studio can deliver the amazing &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; game that we all want to play.” We also learned today that a PS4 version of the next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFtQaA"&gt;The studio posted a tweet confirming the delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gGj6Kh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/LLXnEof2Lg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LLXnEof2Lg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Santa Monica Studio Is Hiring (@SonySantaMonica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1400135437763584002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TMBPVz"&gt;Where does this leave Sony’s other big-budget single-player game, &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;? Hulst says the team is tentatively planning on a holiday 2021 release, but the team won’t nail down a release date. He says that the development of both &lt;em&gt;Horizon &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; have been “affected by access to performance capture and talent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVKKyC"&gt;While the news of &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s delay and uncertainty surrounding the release window of the next &lt;em&gt;Horizon &lt;/em&gt;title might be disappointing, Hulst made a statement about avoiding crunch at its studios. “With these things, something’s gotta give. It cannot be the quality of our titles, and it surely won’t be the health of the wellbeing of our amazing team.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about the rise and fall of a $77 million game cheating empire</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="PUBG" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NkOePz3-lV_2eNBGe9CRC-IqQCw=/124x0:1474x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378134/PUBG_Deadshot.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JjZWOo"&gt;Free-to-play games are hugely successful (in 2020, &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pubg-mobile-five-billion-revenue"&gt;reportedly made $2.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; in China alone), but that success attracts unscrupulous developers who earn their own small fortunes helping players cheat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fiTWP"&gt;If you’ve ever wanted a peek inside that kind of operation before it implodes, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ywj3/inside-the-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-empire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s feature&lt;/a&gt; on the rise and fall of an infamous game cheating ring for &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; which authorities call &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93weq8/chinese-police-dismantle-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-operation"&gt;Chicken Drumstick&lt;/a&gt; is worth a read. It features a rare account from “Catfish,” the software engineer who claims to be behind the $77 million business — and who ultimately decided to bring it to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWHhJn"&gt;Catfish became interested in making cheats for &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;) on PC after dealing with cheaters himself, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai writes. When the PUBG Corporation released the mobile version of the game, Catfish made a cheat for it that he and his business partner eventually sold. The cheat was very popular — “it sold thousands of copies within a few days,” Catfish told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; — but also started a “cat-and-mouse game.” PUBG Corporation would patch the game; Catfish and his partner would adapt the cheats so players could still see through walls or aim perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlAkVJ"&gt;The group — actually called Sharpshooter and then Cheat Ninja, but referred to by police as Chicken Drumstick — would grow into a business that authorities claim earned tens of millions of dollars, even though in China, the sale of these sorts of cheats is considered a hacking crime. Tencent, which is a partial owner of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, ultimately reported Cheat Ninja to authorities in 2020, prompting an investigation and the arrest of the group’s lead salespeople. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg4w0q"&gt;Catfish went into hiding earlier this year and ultimately decided to shut down the multi-layered, international cheating operation he had spent years building. The reason why is worth reading &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ywj3/inside-the-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-empire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s feature&lt;/a&gt; to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti will be available at 81 Best Buy stores on Thursday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DitlPKQNspKIMpHHGhKUyqjsH2g=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378068/twarren_20210601_4611_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F9Gvdi"&gt;Nvidia just announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461660/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;new $1,199 RTX 3080 Ti graphics card&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s set to release tomorrow, June 3rd. It hasn’t exactly been easy to buy a graphics card &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;as of late&lt;/a&gt;, though, and it seems extremely likely that demand for this new card is going to be through the roof. If you’re looking to try to pick one up, you might want to consider Best Buy, which has announced that customers will be able to line up at 81 of its stores for the chance to snag a Founder’s Edition of the card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMFTqR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/what-to-know-about-nvidias-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-founders-edition-graphics-card/"&gt;Here’s the full list of participating stores&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to see if one near you is included. On that website, Best Buy notes that staff at participating stores will hand out tickets for the cards at 7:30AM local time, and if customers receive a ticket, they’ll be guaranteed to be able to buy a card at 9:00AM local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKe2H9"&gt;Each customer can only buy one card, however, which should hopefully limit the number of cards that will be bought to be resold by scalpers. They’ll almost certainly still be in very high demand, however — especially because Best Buy is the only store in the US where you can get the Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceoeql"&gt;If you’re on the fence about whether to get an RTX 3080 Ti, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;my colleague Tom Warren’s review&lt;/a&gt;. While he found it ideal for 1440p and 4K gaming, he also thought the $1,199 price was a little too expensive. But if you’re looking for a 30-series card right now, lining up at Best Buy for the RTX 3080 Ti on Thursday could be your next best shot to get one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to reveal its next generation of Windows on June 24th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jrtbXMucjY78phoBwkPDHxA75w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377629/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yzcD95"&gt;Microsoft is planning to detail its “next generation of Windows” at an event later this month. The software giant has started sending invites to media for a Windows event on June 24th. Both Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and chief product officer Panos Panay will be presenting &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at the Windows event&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s Windows event will start at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92bDwc"&gt;The invite comes just a week after Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;teased a “next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is expected to detail its next significant changes to Windows, and they will likely include a number of visual enhancements. We’re expecting to see some significant UI changes to Windows under something codenamed “Sun Valley.” Microsoft’s event invite even appears to tease a new Windows logo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U712g6TA9t0NHxXYidE5Reo_Qcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22554963/image001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Windows invite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pn6KYs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442421/microsoft-windows-10-x-canceled-official"&gt;Microsoft confirmed last month&lt;/a&gt; that Windows 10X, its OS originally built for dual-screen devices, will no longer ship. The company is now rolling the visual elements of Windows 10X into the main version of Windows 10 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HedK09"&gt;A lot of the visual work has already started, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also focusing on improving the basic foundations of Windows, with fixes for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, the addition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt;, and improvements to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShBLeO"&gt;Nadella has also promised to unlock a better economy for developers and creators within Windows itself, so we’ll likely get a closer look at the store changes coming to Windows. Microsoft has been working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;new app store for Windows&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, and rumors have suggested Microsoft will open its store up to all apps and rival payment platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n65598"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering Microsoft’s Windows event on June 24th, so stay tuned for all the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eufy’s new battery-powered security cameras have local storage and don’t require a hub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPfOAAVD9Azh3Sf-diS0siLCk6o=/0x667:4000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377517/SoloCam_E40.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pHAhQR"&gt;Eufy, the Anker-owned smart home brand, is announcing a new SoloCam line of battery-powered security cameras that have local storage and are designed to operate without connecting to a separate hub. The new lineup will include two “Essential” (standard) cameras, two spotlight cameras, and one solar-powered camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugyDWf"&gt;The standard and spotlight SoloCams will be offered in 1080p or 2K resolution models, and Eufy says that you can get four months of battery on a single charge. All of the cameras also offer 8GB of local storage, which Eufy estimates should hold at least two months of video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVOMwd"&gt;You’ll be able to preorder all of the models of the SoloCam on Wednesday, but they’ll be shipping out at different times over the next couple months. Here are the availability dates and pricing for each of the cameras, as shared by Eufy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntDIZY"&gt;SoloCam 1080p Essential (the E20): out in mid-June for $99.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O5sekj"&gt;SoloCam 2K Essential (the E40): out in late June for $129.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="knTlIw"&gt;SoloCam 1080p Spotlight (the L20): available via “online channels” in mid-July for $149.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="94Cp05"&gt;SoloCam 2K Spotlight (the L40): available via “retailer partners” in late July for $169.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK4C2G"&gt;SoloCam Solar (the S40): available in mid-August for $199.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Agadab"&gt;Eufy is launching the cameras following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440298/eufy-privacy-glitch-server-error-camera-feed-exposed"&gt;a security incident in May&lt;/a&gt; that let some users of the company’s home security cameras see video from other users’ homes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444164/eufy-security-camera-glitch-privacy-feed-exposed-statement-details"&gt;In an apology&lt;/a&gt;, Eufy said that the issue happened during a software update and that 712 people were affected.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS4 and PS5 gaming subscriptions are up to 27 percent off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mmGoFseDYItFrufha4WfcbTIDCA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377461/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCY2YS"&gt;Deals from the last week or so have been especially kind to gamers who have a PS4 or PS5. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/"&gt;Days of Play sale event&lt;/a&gt; has discounted many games, and today there are price cuts on subscriptions that will help you get more enjoyment out of your console. At Newegg, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsony-12-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832886006" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus is $44&lt;/a&gt;, down from Sony’s usual $60 price. It’s just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Days-Digital/dp/B095QN8KH1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one dollar more at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d prefer to shop there. This service will allow you to play online multiplayer games, and it’ll make you eligible to download some complimentary games every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVQlEv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aTf841"&gt;Another useful service that’s more affordable today is PlayStation Now, which is effectively Sony’s take on Xbox Game Pass. It lets you download some of the games in its library, while it resorts to cloud game streaming for others. That service is usually $60, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Days-Digital/dp/B095QK3PQF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but Amazon has it available for $45&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most appealing features of PS Now is that you can play on a PlayStation console, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-now/ps-now-on-pc/"&gt;as well as on PC via an app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n5KpnW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10530177"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ7khG"&gt;Amazon has knocked $100 off the cost of Insignia’s 43-inch 4K TV that has Fire TV hardware built in. Normally $320, it’s $220, but you have to be a Prime member to get this deal. This is likely just a tease of more deals to come during Prime Day 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;which was just confirmed this morning to be happening on Monday, June 21st and Tuesday, June 22nd&lt;/a&gt;. If you want more deals, be sure to join us for in-depth deal coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwgRQc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10530201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="akx2JC"&gt;If you have a Roku streaming device and wish that the remote had more buttons to control your TV’s base features as well as your entertainment center, you should snag this handy gadget from Sideclick. It’s a programmable remote that snaps onto your remote and adds the ability to turn on your TV, switch inputs, adjust the volume and channels, and to control things like a Blu-ray player, soundbar, and more. It usually costs $30, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742303278719026640#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has it for $20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XjlCyB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10530228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
