    <title>TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Loki’s signature gadget, reviewed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Jz0XaO"&gt;As time goes on, mobile devices have grown ever more powerful in their function: what were once simple communication devices or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design"&gt;multimedia players&lt;/a&gt; have turned into tiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;pocket-sized supercomputers&lt;/a&gt; that are jam-packed with features. And nothing exemplifies this trend more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;TVA TemPad&lt;/a&gt;, which packs in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;temporal tracking and manipulation abilities&lt;/a&gt; that give the most ordinary of owners powers that surpass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;even the mightiest of heroes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHROTY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s first season ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g2U87g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Loki built a different reality with retro hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gzkGC9"&gt;Unlike most modern devices, the TemPad aims for an almost retro-futuristic design. Despite featuring dual displays on both the exterior and interior of the device, the TemPad itself is clad in a warm wood and brass finish that’s reminiscent of a simpler time. Broadly speaking, the TemPad harkens back to a pre-iPhone era: the external touchscreen, matched with an internal display and physical keys, brings to mind older devices like 2007’s LG Voyager and a time before blank, featureless touchscreen slates dominated the market. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C0EaK3YQWXR5tgKLyFZLyeaLXC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716031/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.25.53_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qEdagF"&gt;Instead of a full QWERTY keyboard, though, the TemPad only offers a doubled numpad, along with an oddly shaped D-pad and a dedicated Miss Minutes button. But the TemPad is primarily controlled through the spherical black control surface, which works as a tappable button with additional gestures. A cutout in the top display also cleverly allows it to be used when the device is closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npnaIm"&gt;The TemPad puts that external display to good use, both for showing its standard suite of apps (like those used to track branching nexus events and the shattering of time and space) as well as a Galaxy Note-esque memo feature that allows for quick doodling on the external touchscreen. Notably, the TemPad also offers the ability to automatically animate and then project those drawings as 3D holograms, a decidedly unique feature compared to most other mobile hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAKhgnYQfTYVjp_VlXEyd4NVqFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716032/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.01.07_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8MSEGBX-UpwlvMgcgGx9N5inXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716034/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.01.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkclY0"&gt;The TemPad hardware also offers you a wide variety of storage options: the device can be simply pocketed, of course, but the TVA also offers both a belt-mounted and a clever wrist-mounted case option for keeping your pad close at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q6ujm"&gt;The flagship feature on the TemPad is its ability to create Timedoors, glowing orange doors that let you traverse the boundless realm of space and time, hopping between timelines and alternate realities more or less at will. It’s an incredibly useful feature, one that helps make up for the TemPad’s limited application support, lack of an App Store, and poor hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="AHS1eM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life on the TemPad leaves much to be desired&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGYeUDELsCfkwQRhdDRasiN5KzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716038/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.14.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPexDi"&gt;Battery life on the TemPad also leaves much to be desired. Timedoors, in particular, use up a lot of power, leaving one at risk of getting stranded in all manner of unfortunate locations. Exacerbating this is the fact that recharging a pad is also extremely difficult — requiring something akin to “the power source to a civilization’s only hope” to power it back up again, a markedly more difficult task than finding a USB-C brick with high enough wattage to support fast-charging on most devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKbJeB"&gt;Like many mobile devices, the TemPad features a smart digital assistant, Miss Minutes, which works across a variety of TVA technologies and devices. Unlike Siri or Bixby, though, Miss Minutes is a semi-sentient artificial intelligence, capable of responding intelligently to queries. Miss Minutes is used to help compensate for some of the TemPad’s limitations, offering a way to look up older records without resorting to tedious text inputs. Tasks occasionally take longer than usual, however, as the assistant has been known to have her own plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F6rFd"&gt;Perhaps the biggest flaw in the TemPad is its decidedly low-resolution display technology. While most phones and laptops opt for colorful LCDs or vibrant OLED panels, the TemPad features a rather uninspired two-tone orange-on-black display. Text is chunky, images are rendered at a frustratingly low resolution, and maps for tracking variants are vague 2D outlines. Video playback, while possible, leaves much to be desired, requiring that you zoom in on portions of a video just to be able to discern identifiable features in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7XkDdlhX3QOtHqtcGkeIgQEGLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716039/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.08.32_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrZjc91NTuIc8oZw64Hm9hawIrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716037/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_4.05.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QUw3ts"&gt;The TemPad is also unfortunately fragile for a mobile device, with at least one device shattering into a spark- and smoke-spewing pile after a rough fall. Given the active intended audience for the TemPad, a little more rugged durability would be nice to see on future models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QodA15"&gt;Continuing its throwback design, the TemPad’s UI resembles that of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_1000"&gt;early Palm OS&lt;/a&gt; (a similarity that’s only exacerbated by the low-resolution, two-tone display). The home screen only displays four apps at once; the default offerings include the flagship Timedoor application, Settings, Directory, and the Miss Minutes assistant. The UI is occasionally difficult to manage, though, making it easy for you to accidentally open Timedoors to undesired locations when not taking the proper care to select a destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzexfl"&gt;Another misstep with the TemPad is the heavy reliance on enterprise-level software. While the ability to track timeline variants and analyze the impact of branching nexus events is no doubt useful to TVA agents and judges, the average consumer isn’t going to get much use out of those features. More conventional contact and mapping applications would go a long way toward making the TemPad a more useful day-to-day device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qgAIgv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10650974"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PeL0Rx"&gt;Another issue with the TemPad is availability: right now, the device is only accessible by TVA agents who have been kidnapped by a nefarious organization and brainwashed to enforce a single instance of reality, mercilessly pruning anyone or anything that stands in the way of that goal. It’s a decidedly steep price to have to pay for the hardware, especially given that it still can’t play TikTok videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is crowdfunding these Diane von Furstenberg Echo Dots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ‘Midnight Kiss’ Diane von Furstenberg Echo Dot." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgVuo9_-wsDdvjnGTgIxm_u9lJU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580196/Midnight_Kiss_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJRL0u"&gt;Amazon is launching the next line of products for its Build It crowdfunding platform. The company has collaborated with fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg on a range of Echo Dot smart speakers that’ll only go on sale if enough people pre-order them within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nerclG"&gt;That’s by no means a given. Amazon launched the Build It program earlier this year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286662/amazon-alexa-cuckoo-clock-build-it-program-preorder"&gt;three Alexa-powered devices&lt;/a&gt; — a nutrition scale, a cuckoo clock, and a sticky note printer — and only the last of those reached its goal in time. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SPBLN1C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently estimates&lt;/a&gt; that the Smart Sticky Note Printer will ship between July and September, but if you didn’t get in on the Build It campaign, you can’t pre-order it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn1I2F"&gt;The Echo Dot x Diane von Furstenberg range comes in three variations: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotMidnightKiss"&gt;Midnight Kiss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotIkat"&gt;Ikat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EchoDotTwigs"&gt;Twigs&lt;/a&gt;. They all have a “special promo price” of $59.99 each, which is $10 more than a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;regular fourth-gen Dot&lt;/a&gt; or the same price as the cute panda and tiger Kids Edition model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hgjri"&gt;Here’s the full collection:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fTsPvwTusOGLTvVxnHiy8QRbj_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714278/Echo_Dot_x_Diane_von_Furstenberg_Logos.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;From left to right: Twigs, Ikat, and Midnight Kiss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pGGyp2"&gt;Amazon isn’t saying exactly how many people will need to order each model for it to actually get built, but the deadline is August 13th. You’ll only be charged if and when the products ship out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skyward Sword HD is just the thing to hold you over until Breath of the Wild 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/26Qyi7KuVXIG2N32nDzabf1a7jQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580198/Switch_ZeldaSSHD_ND_Feb_SCRN16_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwxi1C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; changed a lot about &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Most importantly, it made the fantasy realm of Hyrule more open, increasing the sense of pure adventure. If you saw something off on the horizon — a crumbling ruin, a giant mountain, whatever — you could find your own way there, rather than following a path laid out by the game’s developers. It’s what made the game so refreshing, but it could also make going back to older entries challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnM4cA"&gt;At least, that was my fear playing &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;, which originally launched a decade ago and is coming to the Switch this week. Aside from a few quality-of-life tweaks, slightly updated visuals, and the very welcome addition of a motion control-free control scheme, the new version is the same as the one that debuted on the Wii in 2011. That means it’s a largely linear affair that’s missing the open-ended structure that made &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt; so engrossing. But it still has enough &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; magic to make it worth playing — particularly if you missed it the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwHBMz"&gt;The core is the same as always. A quiet young boy named Link discovers that he’s actually a hero — shock! — and eventually gets a legendary sword and green outfit to help him on a quest to save a princess named Zelda. But as with the best &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; adventures, &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; takes that basic formula in interesting new directions. The game begins in a city in the clouds. The residents of this small, floating village ride giant birds like horses and live above a sprawling cloud barrier that separates them from what they believe is a desolate and inaccessible surface. Naturally, this is exactly where Link needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QstdDw-Ro9GIAtmm2DZptnTpQaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715686/Switch_ZeldaSSHD_ND_Feb_SCRN17_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8z1VTt"&gt;The premise was refreshing a decade ago, and it still remains an enticing world to explore. There’s something really fun about soaring through the sky, exploring this very different history of Hyrule. At its best, &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; takes a familiar place and makes it feel new — there’s a reason &lt;em&gt;Wind Waker&lt;/em&gt; is so beloved — and that’s exactly what happens in &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;. This was especially true back in 2011, as it was the next mainline &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; after the comparatively drab &lt;em&gt;Twilight Princess&lt;/em&gt;. Each entry is like a new take on an ancient fable. &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; remains one of the more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROIavU"&gt;But while the world still feels fresh after all this time, the actual game is very familiar territory. Unlike &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; pushes you along a predetermined path, where you go through a series of areas — a forest, a desert, a volcano — solving puzzles in order to get to the dungeon at the end, where you’ll find another bread crumb in your search for Zelda. And in traditional &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; fashion, you’ll slowly gather new items that open up new areas. That could be a slingshot for shooting down vines or a magically controlled drone that lets you hit switches remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SiNDnt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:803778"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFOvRm"&gt;There’s a satisfying sense of progression, even if the straightforward structure can feel dated. &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword &lt;/em&gt;funnels you along a path; the path can be large at times, but there’s usually only one or two things you can or should be doing. It’s missing the sense of freedom and serendipity that are so core to &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt;. This didn’t bother me as much as I expected — likely because the world is still so interesting, and the puzzles and combat remain excellent — but it can be frustrating at times, particularly if you find yourself stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY3GpJ"&gt;The big change between this version of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; and the original is the controls. &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; was built with motion controls in mind; it originally required the Wii’s MotionPlus add-on, which made your sword swipes more accurate. You can still play that way, wielding two Joy-Con controllers like a sword and shield. But on the Switch, there’s also a more traditional control scheme so you can play in portable mode or use a Pro Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VB94xmw0nHEGFrx0yCmEa50asO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715921/Switch_ZeldaSSHD_ND_Feb_SCRN11_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yjUexO"&gt;For the most part, it works. Sword swipes have been moved to the right analog stick, which you can use to replicate thrusting a sword in various directions. As someone who doesn’t enjoy flailing my arms in front of a screen, it’s a welcome addition, but there are a few little niggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFyeB0"&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; on the Switch finally adds camera controls to the game, one of the biggest omissions from the original. But the way they work is a little wonky. In order to rotate the camera, you have to hold the left shoulder button and move the right stick — the same stick that controls your sword. I kept finding myself swinging a weapon when I meant to look around; it’s just natural to go straight for the right stick when you need to rotate the camera. It’s especially annoying in battle if you need to both attack and look around at the same time. (The lock-on option helps somewhat, but not when there are lots of bad guys or bosses that teleport around.) The right stick is freed up when using motion controls, but this does require a level of coordination I don’t seem to possess; it’s tough to rotate a camera with your thumb while also swinging your arm around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PzXi7"&gt;Aside from that, this port is improved in all of the expected ways. It runs smooth, the graphics look cleaner (despite a few muddy textures here and there), and the new control scheme makes it a more accessible version of &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;. There are even some nice little tweaks, like a slightly less chatty talking sword that serves as your guide. The biggest barrier is your expectations. Yes, it can feel dated after &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild. &lt;/em&gt;But for me at least, the fantastical world, clever puzzles, and challenging dungeons made it worth pressing through. And given that the still-untitled sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;looks like it’ll feature a similar sky-themed world&lt;/a&gt;, this could be just the thing to hold you over until its release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngGRW5"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on July 16th on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix Kids’ new Top 10 row makes content discovery a little easier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p1_EBPiByuTeFXOX5VWqp-6ZZh8=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580266/Kids_Profile_Top10_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix Kids will now have its own top 10 row.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAVyWL"&gt;Netflix is launching two new tools this week that should help make finding age-appropriate content a little easier to discover within the kids version of its streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbtVx3"&gt;Today, Netflix is introducing a new Top 10 row for age-restricted profiles, borrowing one of the most useful tools for discovery from the adult version of the service. Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151327/netflix-top-10-list-homepage-subscribers-originals-licensed-movies-tv-shows"&gt;existing top 10 tool&lt;/a&gt; works by surfacing the most popular titles on the service, often new and original titles, which can make finding something to stream a lot less of a headache. Launching in 93 countries, the row will be updated daily and will feature both shows and movies with the regional equivalent of a PG and below rating. Additionally, titles that make the cut will display a “Top 10” badge across Netflix when they’ve made the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CZ1xX"&gt;The company said the new top 10 section will appear across TV apps, web, and mobile (iOS and Android), a notable exception being Apple TV. A spokesperson for Netflix told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that support will also not be included on some older devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2zcyaTdc75sIvdfIeIPkkKou5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716051/Kids_Recap_Email.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids Recap Email displayed on a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gBR5Sz"&gt;Separately, Netflix is also introducing a biweekly Kids Recap Email that will launch Friday. The email, sent to account holders with at least one kids’ profile set up, will cover tips for using the platform’s features, offer insight about the kind of content being watched on kids profiles, and will recommend similar content based on viewing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNNp7Y"&gt;The new features arrive as Netflix continues to invest in its children's programming. The company &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/kids-sensations-cocomelon-and-little-baby-bum-get-all-new-animated-series"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; it had partnered with Moonbug Entertainment on new series and specials based on characters from the popular animated &lt;em&gt;CoComelon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Little Baby Bum&lt;/em&gt; properties that would begin streaming in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thsY37"&gt;Heather Tilert, Netflix’s director of original animation for preschool viewers, said in a statement that the company was “thrilled to partner with Moonbug to expand the worlds of both shows, and to bring our youngest viewers even more songs, stories, and adventures from some of their favorite animated friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s educational ‘Today at Apple’ classes are launching on YouTube with a Peanuts-themed session</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjaJIZ9WGSLKpmK_8KscUL0kTHk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580223/Snoopy02.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn how to draw yourself as a &lt;/em&gt;Peanuts&lt;em&gt; character in the first “Today at Apple” YouTube session.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUqCvi"&gt;Apple is bringing its educational “Today at Apple” classes to YouTube, the company announced Wednesday. The first episode will show you how to draw yourself as a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; character in the company’s Pages app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lU1Kgc"&gt;The session features two people who work on the Apple TV Plus show &lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt; — showrunner Mark Evestaff and storyboard artist Krista Porter — and it’s hosted by an Apple Store employee named Anthony. I’ve watched the nearly 10-minute episode, and it’s a pretty easy guide to follow about turning yourself into a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; cartoon. Unsurprisingly, it’s packed with Apple technologies; Anthony and Porter draw on iPads using Apple Pencils, and they’re collaborating in the same Pages document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ijEdo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today at Apple” first launched in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQkzIU"&gt;Apple first announced the “Today at Apple” program in 2017 as a community-focused feature of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15419398/apple-store-redesign-genius-bar-grove"&gt;larger retail makeover&lt;/a&gt;. But the company has had to move &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftoday%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22576342%2Ftoday-at-apple-youtube-classes-sessions-peanuts-snoopy-show" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some sessions online&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic, which forced Apple to close down many of its US retail stores. Although all 270 US stores reopened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the pandemic began, this new YouTube series signals that Apple is still working to build ways to educate its customers without requiring them to step inside a physical store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrHHJJ"&gt;The first episode of the series is available now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o3YkOQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0nWcBVvhd0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ayWPho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 9:15AM ET: Added the first episode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HyperX’s excellent Cloud Alpha S gaming headset is just $90 at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DO_86n60VRpJjR0TEU5ZnVU7xI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580077/cfaulkner_200324_3947_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CY2op3"&gt;The gaming industry saw explosive growth in 2020, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;more than half of US residents turning to video games&lt;/a&gt; as a way to pass the time, socialize, and generally entertain themselves during the pandemic. If you’re new to the whole gaming thing, however, you might want to consider picking up a capable headset before jumping into competitive play. Thankfully, everything in HyperX’s headset lineup is consistently reliable, with the Cloud Alpha S being a solid choice for those looking for clean sound, comfort, and a subtle look that should mesh well with just about anything. Right now, the jet black model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Alpha-Adjustable-Leatherette/dp/B081D8TPZZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $90&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching the best price we’ve seen on the wired headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21191577/hyperx-cloud-alpha-s-gaming-headset-black-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The Blue Yeti is a certifiable classic, though it’s not always the cheapest given how popular USB mics have become in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings and virtual meetups. The versatile mic is easy to set up and just as simple to use, and its three-capsule microphone can capture clear, warm sound that should be appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup. Normally $120, the Blue Yeti is &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13112209?sid=VergeDeals071421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fblue-yeti-usb-mic-for-recording-streaming-1%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_1_9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Woot for $100&lt;/a&gt;, a decent percentage off even it’s not the lowest price we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lVCOEp"&gt;
&lt;p id="4B0uaZ"&gt;If you’re in need of a no-frills mouse, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Faccessories-and-monitors%2Fkeyboards-and-mice%2Fmice%2FMX-MASTER-2S-WL-MOUSE-WRLS%2Fp%2F78016250&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22575387%2Fhyperx-gaming-headset-logitech-mx-master-2s-mouse-blue-yeti-microphone-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech MX Master 2S is available at Lenovo for $50&lt;/a&gt; with coupon code &lt;strong&gt;MXMASTER50&lt;/strong&gt; (discount applies at checkout). The last-gen device isn’t as capable as the upgraded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848369/logitech-mx-master-3-keys-best-mouse-even-better-magnetic-scroll-wheel"&gt;MX Master 3&lt;/a&gt; — there’s no magnetic scroll wheel or USB-C support — but the professional mouse remains a great budget buy at half the cost. Its main selling point is its comfortable ergonomic build. It’s also outfitted with a 4,000 DPI sensor and support for Logitech Flow, a feature that lets you quickly transition between multiple computers by simply moving your mouse cursor from one device to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s satellite internet team joins Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QaepfXSLXIstUnOz3yj5EBTaYIs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579848/acastro_190201_1777_satellite_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of a satellite in orbit.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B66aFc"&gt;Amazon has acquired a team of employees from Facebook focused on delivering internet connectivity from low Earth orbit satellites, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-acquires-facebooks-satellite-internet-group?utm_source=ti_app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon paid Facebook an undisclosed sum as part of the acquisition, which saw more than a dozen Los Angeles-based employees switch companies in April to work on Project Kuiper. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the news to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhYhzG"&gt;The move brings an end to Facebook’s efforts to deliver internet connectivity to remote areas via its own satellites. When it confirmed the initiative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/21/17598418/facebook-athena-internet-satellite-project-fcc"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; the company said that it believed the technology would make it possible “to bring broadband connectivity to rural regions where internet connectivity is lacking or non-existent.” Facebook had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/mark-zuckerberg-future-of-facebook/aquila-drone-internet"&gt;previously attempted to use internet drones&lt;/a&gt; to achieve similar ends, before shutting down that project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17507826/facebook-aquila-internet-drone-project-shut-down"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Iwi6y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has around 500 employees working on Project Kuiper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIwHHn"&gt;Meanwhile, Amazon’s ambitions to provide internet via satellite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295310/amazon-project-kuiper-satellite-internet-low-earth-orbit-facebook-spacex-starlink"&gt;emerged in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The company has said it expects to invest $10 billion to launch 3,236 satellites into low-earth orbit by 2029 with a similar aim of providing internet to “unserved and underserved communities around the world.” The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;gained FCC approval&lt;/a&gt; to operate the network last year, and will launch half its satellites by 2026. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports that Amazon is building a lab in Redmond, WA, and that it currently has around 500 employees working on its satellite internet project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XVY3i"&gt;Late last year, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;revealed the design of the antennas&lt;/a&gt; its customers will eventually use to receive internet from its satellite internet service. However, the company is yet to launch any of its satellites into space. Back in April Amazon confirmed it had signed an agreement with rocket operator United Launch Alliance (ULA) for nine launches, but it did not provide a timeline for when these launches would occur, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/amazon-signs-ula-rockets-to-launch-bezos-kuiper-internet-satellites.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOoKQQ"&gt;Amazon is one of a handful of tech companies attempting to use satellites to offer internet connectivity in parts of the world where it would be prohibitively expensive to install fixed infrastructure. SpaceX is perhaps the most well known, and eventually plans to launch nearly 12,000 satellites into orbit. It’s already offering the Starlink service as a beta to a limited number of users, although performance from the roughly 1,3000 satellites already in orbit has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;inconsistent so far&lt;/a&gt;. OneWeb is another company making investments in the area, but ran into financial difficulties last year when it was forced to file for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/28/21189404/oneweb-chapter-11-bankruptcy-space"&gt;bankruptcy protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="DqGONY"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;TV show is getting a second season, according to a scene appended to the sixth and final episode of its first season. The confirmation, first &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/loki-season-2-marvel-1235019442/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; comes mid-way through the episode’s credits at the 42 minute and 48 second mark, when a stamp appears on screen which simply reads “Loki will return in season 2.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4qpQx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is the third Marvel show to have premiered on Disney Plus, and the first to have had a second season officially confirmed. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;star Elizabeth Olsen has confirmed that the show, which premiered in January this year, &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/elizabeth-olsen-says-wandavision-definitely-not-getting-a-season-2/"&gt;isn’t due to receive a second season&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile it’s currently unclear whether &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;will return for a second season, especially given the show leads neatly into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400190/captain-america-4-falcon-winter-solider-creator-malcolm-spellman-report"&gt;upcoming fourth Captain America movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sjdTD"&gt;It’s currently unclear when the second season of &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;will release, but &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes that the last episode of its first season leads into the upcoming Marvel film &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, which is due to release March 2022. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; season 2 joins a host of other Marvel shows announced for Disney Plus including &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;She Hulk &lt;/em&gt;and an untitled series focused around Wakanda from the &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats have a new plan to legalize marijuana federally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hoVZTa_NOGcIYINlsCljA1Yjmmk=/0x0:5079x3386/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579598/1041897598.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1kAAwV"&gt;On Wednesday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) released a discussion draft of legislation that proposes sweeping reform to marijuana policy in the US. The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act would decriminalize marijuana federally, expunge federal non-violent cannabis convictions (and encourage states to do the same), and create “new grant programs to fund nonprofits that provide services to those adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNAmjv"&gt;In the introduction to the 30-page draft legislation, the senators note that adult use of cannabis is already legal in 18 states, Washington D.C., the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Medicinal marijuana is even more widespread, legal in 37 states, Puerto Rico, D.C., Guam, and the US Virgin Islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EbtUo7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;”a dynamic shift in public opinion and support”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a5RZmN"&gt;“These changes represent a dynamic shift in public opinion and support across the political spectrum,” the statement notes. “State-compliant cannabis businesses will finally be treated like other businesses and allowed access to essential financial services, like bank accounts and loans. Medical research will no longer be stifled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfChwJ"&gt;Despite recent state actions, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and subject to prosecution by federal agencies even in states where cannabis use is permitted. In practice, those prosecutions have been limited, but the risk of federal action has meant that marijuana businesses have limited options when it came to banking and many non-recreational uses of the plant have been stifled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlYpJD"&gt;The ambiguous legal status of marijuana in the US has also heightened racial inequalities in the justice system. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/a-tale-of-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-in-the-era-of-marijuana-reform/"&gt;2020 analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;, Black Americans were more than three times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession as white Americans. An &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/dc-marijuana-arrest-legal/2020/09/15/65c20348-d01b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html"&gt;analysis by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year found that between 2015 and 2019, Black people accounted for 89 percent of the 3,631 marijuana arrests in Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjpAox"&gt;The proposed legislation addresses this directly with a number of restorative measures directed towards communities who suffered disproportionately from marijuana prohibitions. The proposal would expunge federal non-violent marijuana convictions and allow individuals currently serving time to petition for resentencing. The legislation would also create an ongoing fund directing revenue generated from federal cannabis taxes to “reinvest in the communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWirat"&gt;In addition, the proposed legislation would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="36Wo1M"&gt;establish a minimum age of 21 for cannabis retail sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qXIOAD"&gt;conduct an evaluation of the societal impact of legalization by states with adult use of cannabis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b0GM6h"&gt;introduce three grant programs to create opportunity for those harmed by the War on Drugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T0Yize"&gt;expunge non-violent federal marijuana arrests and conviction, and encourage states to do the same. Those serving time in federal prison for non-violent marijuana crimes would be able to petition a court for resentencing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6ASNKR"&gt;provide funding to eligible states and localities for loan programs for small cannabis businesses owned by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cqT9an"&gt;impose an excise tax on cannabis products similar to those on alcohol and tobacco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gZaTmw"&gt;The legislation would also transfer jurisdiction over cannabis regulation from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). The FDA would have authority over manufacture and marketing of cannabis products, and the TTB would have regulatory authority over taxation of cannabis. And revenue generated by federal taxes would support restorative justice and public health and safety research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIDRFJ"&gt;The bill stops short of mandating legal status for cannabis across the United States. Under the proposed rule, state and local governments and Indian tribes would still be able to adopt and enforce rules and regulations over cannabis more stringent than the FDA requirements. The legislation would create a Cannabis Products Regulatory Advisory Committee, which the FDA would “convene and consult with before promulgating regulations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pw10Mm"&gt;The bill has not been formally introduced to Congress, and a final legislative draft is not expected until later this year. As described in the summary, the existing proposal is simply a discussion draft, “meant to spur a robust discussion among stakeholders” as the three sponsoring Senators finalize their proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ueyOZ"&gt;Still, the effort arrives at a moment of unique momentum for marijuana reform in the US. Voters approved new cannabis laws in four states in the November 2020 elections, and Democrats in the House &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/04/house-poised-to-vote-to-decriminalize-marijuana/"&gt;passed the MORE act in December&lt;/a&gt; which would have decriminalized cannabis and expunged criminal records of those convicted of marijuana-related crimes. President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"&gt;said during his campaign&lt;/a&gt; that he would seek to “reschedule cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts,” although Biden’s Justice Department has been slow to take action on the pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdsgFD"&gt;Concerned stakeholders are encouraged to submit comments to the Senate Finance Committee by September, using the email address &lt;a href="mailto:Cannabis_Reform@finance.senate.gov"&gt;Cannabis_Reform@finance.senate.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Retail stores are packed with unchecked facial recognition, civil rights organizations say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_NeFN0pdTvkvxwKZXa2ms2ANlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69579594/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FQXGSy"&gt;More than 35 organizations are demanding top US retailers cease using facial recognition to identify shoppers and employees in their stores, which companies have used to deter theft and identify shoplifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7yrN9"&gt;The campaign is aptly named Ban Facial Recognition in Stores, and has &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/stores/"&gt;identified stores&lt;/a&gt; that have committed to not using facial recognition, like Walmart, Home Depot, and Target. It is now pressuring companies currently using the technology, or those who might use it in the future. Some companies that are currently using the technology, according to the website, include Apple, Lowe’s, Albertsons, Macy’s, and Ace Hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pse3ix"&gt;Companies that might use it in the future include McDonalds, Walgreens, and 7-Eleven. A &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/stores/"&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrNHbh"&gt;Privacy non-profit Fight for the Future organized the campaign last month as part of its larger Ban Facial Recognition project, and but has now garnered support from civil rights organizations like Mijente, Public Citizen, and Data for Black Lives, as well as others like the Consumer Federation of America and the Tor Project. Notably, facial recognition company &lt;a href="https://www.kairos.com/"&gt;Kairos&lt;/a&gt;, which touts itself as an ethical vendor of the tech, has also signed onto the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOJjZ7"&gt; Tawana Petty, the national organizing director at Data for Black Lives, explains in the campaign’s press release that Detroit has implemented Project Green Light, which places surveillance cameras with facial recognition in more than 700 businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9tUhA"&gt;“These cameras using facial recognition are monitored at real-time crime centers, police precincts, and on officers’ mobile devices 24/7,” she said. “It’s difficult to explain the psychological toll it takes on a community, knowing that your every move is being monitored by a racially biased algorithm with the power to yank your freedom away from you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHzNuQ"&gt;Retailers have used invasive technologies like products that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html"&gt;ping your phone’s Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/"&gt;then catalog its unique MAC address&lt;/a&gt;, but AI-powered upgrades to video surveillance systems have allowed features like facial recognition to be more accessible than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jBLam"&gt;For instance, Rite-Aid quietly installed facial recognition cameras in hundreds of US stores, mostly in non-white and lower-income neighborhoods, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-riteaid-software/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020. The cameras scanned shoppers’ faces to try and find people in the store who were previously suspected of criminal activity and then sent alerts to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STcx17"&gt;Walmart also reportedly used Clearview AI’s facial recognition more than 300 times, according to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and had &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2015/11/09/wal-mart-facial-recognition/"&gt;previously used&lt;/a&gt; the technology to try and catch shoplifters. Now, it seems to be taking a different approach by using AI to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48718198"&gt;find un-scanned goods&lt;/a&gt; in self-checkout kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUfNoO"&gt;Since these stores are private property, companies are not bound by &lt;a href="https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/map/"&gt;state or local regulations&lt;/a&gt; banning government use of facial recognition which have been the most popular form of regulation. Only Portland, Oregon has &lt;a href="https://www.portland.gov/smart-city-pdx/news/2020/9/9/city-council-approves-ordinances-banning-use-face-recognition"&gt;included private businesses&lt;/a&gt; in a facial recognition ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiJr9"&gt;Fight for the Future also points out that the coronavirus pandemic has expanded the use of facial recognition-adjacent surveillance in stores, which includes software for customer counting and social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
