    <title>President of Elon Musk’s Neuralink venture tweets that he’s left the company</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJpqJE"&gt;Neuralink President Max Hodak tweeted Saturday that he has left the company he co-founded with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk xxx. Hodak didn’t elaborate on why he left the company or elaborate on the circumstance for his departure. “I am no longer at Neuralink (as of a few weeks ago),” he tweeted. “I learned a ton there and remain a huge cheerleader for the company! Onward to new things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCy8cC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;✨Some personal news:✨ I am no longer at Neuralink (as of a few weeks ago). I learned a ton there and remain a huge cheerleader for the company! Onward to new things.&lt;/p&gt;— Max Hodak (@max_hodak) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/max_hodak/status/1388620553569726467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXJ6Lk"&gt;Neuralink is focused on developing brain-machine interfaces. Last month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374749/elon-musk-neuralink-monkey-pong-brain-interface"&gt;posted a video to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to show a monkey with a Neuralink implant in its brain moving a cursor on a computer screen using only its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYaAcU"&gt;Musk and Hodak founded Neuralink along with several other people in 2016, and Musk has invested millions of dollars of his own money into the venture. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/25/elon-musk-neuralink-update-brain-machine-implants/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that some former employees described a chaotic internal culture at Neuralink, saying that its scientists weren’t always given enough time to complete projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaCURu"&gt;While Neuralink didn’t invent brain-machine interfaces, its technology includes thin, flexible wires and more electrodes than other devices, potentially providing more data. Musk has stated that Neuralink’s technology could one day be used to allow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380316949087854595?s=20"&gt;paraplegics to walk again&lt;/a&gt; and allow humans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;achieve “AI symbiosis,”&lt;/a&gt; merging the human brain with an artificial intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6q4DU"&gt;But some in the scientific and medical communities have criticized Neuralink and are skeptical of its scientific claims; after an August 2020 demonstration of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;a pig that had a Neuralink device&lt;/a&gt; implanted in its brain, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/30/1007786/elon-musks-neuralink-demo-update-neuroscience-theater/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; called the company&lt;/a&gt; “neuroscience theater,” and said “most of the company’s medical claims remain highly speculative.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9Myuw"&gt;And as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493224/elon-musk-neuralink-neuroscience-brain-machine"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Nicole Wetsman wrote&lt;/a&gt; last year, “fixing the brain isn’t an engineering problem.” Scientists need to learn much more about how the brain works before any of the concepts Musk describes can come to pass, she added. “The brain is still mysterious, and the neurological causes of things like anxiety and addiction are still unclear,” Wetsman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gA2YEj"&gt;Hodak didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are we seeing the return of the closed-door office? I hope not.</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A 1960s-style open office, with rows of desks and people working." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/md2CsyEq1lunbNeKSc3Lj7D9FLc=/184x0:817x422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222357/Apartment_Office_United_Artists.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An open office, 1960s-style.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: United Artists&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5XPYK"&gt;So it seems that Google, the exemplar of the open-office concept, is trying now to figure out how to keep its design ideals intact while offering its employees at least some feeling of safety in these 6-foot-apart times. Apparently, these measures may include a number of interesting concepts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"&gt;such as inflatable walls&lt;/a&gt;. (A GIF of one of those walls slowly unfolding nearly had me doing a spit-take with my morning coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9sHDaq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s answer to the problems of open plan offices? Inflatable walls","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3UehDn"&gt;These rather complex measures may have some people wondering whether we should abandon the entire open-office concept and go back to a more old-fashioned — but in these pandemic days, safer — plan of separate offices and high-walled cubicles. To tell you the truth, it doesn’t sound like a bad idea. But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5kNAq"&gt;First, let me assure you that I am not a great fan of the whole open-office concept myself. As someone who worked out of a home office for many years, and in a traditional office setting before that, while the comradery that the open office encourages is nice, I don’t love the need to dash for a closed-door “phone booth” every time I receive, or need to make, a personal call — or, in fact, any call. I don’t enjoy having to hide in a cubicle in the ladies’ room if I am even a little upset or angry. In fact, before the pandemic hit, I was strongly tempted to put a photo from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crowd_(1928_film)"&gt;1928 film &lt;em&gt;The Crowd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apartment"&gt;1960’s &lt;em&gt;The Apartment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; up at my desk to show that, well, open offices aren’t exactly new to our times.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The open office circa 1928, in King Vidor’s classic silent film The Crowd." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aubfm7IuA7hhVN7pnYReEjkHlm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481773/the_crowd_1928_king_vidor.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The open office circa 1928, in King Vidor’s classic silent film &lt;em&gt;The Crowd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="89uARa"&gt;On the other hand… One thing I definitely do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; miss about the traditional office structure is what having a private office represented. It was status. It showed what your boss thought of you and your potential. It represented your place in the organization — both to you, and to everyone else. In &lt;em&gt;The Apartment&lt;/em&gt;, for example, Jack Lemmon plays a worker who is promised his own office if he allows executives to use his apartment for their extramarital flings. In other words, he is strongly tempted to compromise his own ethics in order to gain this status symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4q3g3"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Apartment&lt;/em&gt; is just a movie. There are also real-life examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN4FMQ"&gt;Years ago, a newly-appointed editor-in-chief at a publication where I worked decided that he didn’t like me, but didn’t want to look bad by firing an employee who had a good record with the company. So he reassigned me from a private office to a cubicle next to the sales department, where I had to try to do my work while the guy next to me spent the day shouting into his phone. I, and everyone I worked with, recognized the significance of the move. It was meant to tell other workers that I was a pariah. It was meant to tell vendors and PR reps that I was not respected by my publication, and perhaps they should be dealing with someone else. It was meant to convince me to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Today’s open offices are somewhat different." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8lVTdybtOsR9TW4IHmgLeO1kqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8839029/IMG_0158.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Dami Lee&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A more current type of open office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mne2pR"&gt;In a truly open office, where nobody (including the editor-in-chief) has their own office, that is no longer an issue. There are other ways, of course, to mistreat an employee — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318369/google-hr-advised-mental-health-leave-racist-sexist-behavior"&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21314714/ubisoft-harassment-kotaku-toxic-culture"&gt;ways&lt;/a&gt;. But the use of the office as an indication of your status within the company can be incredibly toxic. If Google, and other current companies, can combine the better features of the open-office system with an increase in privacy and safety, then more power to them — even to their weird, inflating walls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX Crew Dragon Resilience safely returns four astronauts to Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASAs SpaceX Crew-1 Splashdown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j--fdvc1FgBqTrE_psiVCi4w3rQ=/168x0:3833x2443/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222303/1232642553.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YetoPH"&gt;Four astronauts returned from the International Space Station early Sunday morning aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico nearly six months after arriving at the orbital laboratory in November last year as the first operational, long-duration crew under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqsV5u"&gt;NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, and Shannon Walker, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Soichi Noguchi boarded Crew Dragon and undocked from the space station at 8:35PM ET Saturday to begin their roughly six-hour trek home. The crew splashed down off the coast of Panama City, Florida at 2:56am ET on Sunday, NASA said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/crew-1-astronauts-safely-splash-down-after-space-station-mission"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSqwGB"&gt;The crew’s return was initially set for Wednesday, April 28th, but was delayed due to high winds in the splashdown zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HqDE2"&gt;The astronaut quartet tallied 167 days aboard the space station, a science laboratory orbiting Earth 250 miles above ground that has continuously housed international crews of astronauts for over two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6R36x"&gt;This particular Crew Dragon spacecraft, dubbed &lt;em&gt;Resilience&lt;/em&gt; by its crew, was the second SpaceX capsule to fly humans, coming after SpaceX’s first crewed mission, Demo-2, in May 2020. &lt;em&gt;Resilience &lt;/em&gt;broke the record for the longest-serving US spacecraft to be docked on the ISS, surpassing the 84 days tallied by the 1974 Skylab 4 crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSRCf5"&gt;Crew Dragon &lt;em&gt;Resilience’s&lt;/em&gt; return marked the first nighttime splashdown of a crewed US spacecraft since December 1968, when Apollo 8 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, NASA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0LawK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21350663/nasa-spacex-crew-dragon-astronauts-bob-behnken-doug-hurley-splash-down"&gt;The first splashdown&lt;/a&gt; of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule took place in August 2020 for the Demo-2 mission, returning NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley from space after a two-month test mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFVF7f"&gt;That splashdown, in the Gulf of Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21351811/spacex-capsule-boaters-splashdown-boats"&gt;attracted a swarm of Florida boaters&lt;/a&gt; coming dangerously close to Crew Dragon. NASA and the US Coast Guard beefed up protections for Crew-1’s splashdown to make sure no one comes close. (The concern: Crew Dragon might leak highly flammable fuels that, if ignited, would endanger anyone coming too close. The crew inside would be safe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inN26H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MI9SD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdP5dx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Chromebook Spin 513 review: a chip off a new block</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A sleek, but slow, Chromebook&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="c4AR1O"&gt;The $399.99 Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (currently listed at $349) is one of the very first Snapdragon-powered Chromebooks to hit the market. Specifically, it’s powered by the Snapdragon 7c Compute SC7180, the type of chip you’d generally expect to see in a tablet or phone. Just from seeing that name, some readers can probably predict exactly what this device is going to be: a lightweight, mediocre performer with excellent battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 open, seen from the back, on a stone bench." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POZKfbR9jgVDkQCLrCSZOKfgihE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480601/mchin_20190722_4563_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Say hello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="urY4aB"&gt;That’s pretty much what it is — but you get some other nice bonuses, too. The display is much nicer than those I’ve seen on other Chromebooks at this price. It’s portable at 2.65 pounds, its speakers and microphones are serviceable, and it has a really smooth Gorilla Glass touchpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWWZUU"&gt;If performance is your priority, there are Chromebooks with better processors you can get for this price. But if it’s not, the Chromebook Spin 513 outshines even more-expensive competitors in a few other areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bZt89N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10475676"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 on a stone bench, seen from above, open. The screen displays a pastoral landscape." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OKipoVnpQd2IIyXi9qHyhE3sxnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480602/mchin_20190722_4563_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could fool me into thinking this was $600.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uFeCgG"&gt;Look through the Chromebooks available at the $300-$400 price point, and you’ll see a whole lot of clunkers. Take a look at Lenovo’s $349 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400085/lenovo-ideapad-flex-3-chromebook-review-price-screen"&gt;Flex 3 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or its $309 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Fstudent-chromebooks%2FLenovo-Chromebook-C340-11%2Fp%2F88LGCC31288&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22412759%2Facer-chromebook-spin-513-review-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chromebook C340&lt;/a&gt;. They’re thicker than the Spin 513, with big bezels, and they both look like they were built in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ6TDO"&gt;But the Spin 513 looks and feels like it belongs in a higher price category. Acer’s model is thinner than both of these devices at 0.61 inches, and has a much more modern look. The lid is made of aluminum, and the reflective Acer logo adds some flair. The bezels on the sides and top are reasonably small, while still leaving plenty of room to hold as a tablet. It’s also quite portable at 2.65 pounds — easy to carry with one hand, and to slip into a backpack or briefcase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 on a stone bench, half open, seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y6NL1m7suvbUVxlne5Do2SgfBJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480595/mchin_20190722_4563_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C, USB-A, audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 on a stone bench, closed, seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o876F34nXOWj3njeHTtB2-GmoZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480596/mchin_20190722_4563_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And another USB-C on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amn8xF"&gt;Speaking of tablet mode, the hinge is sturdy, and you need two hands to open the lid. I’m okay with this, though, because there’s also almost no screen wobble (and screen wobble is the worst). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CQOw6v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10475703"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjmgXL"&gt;The chassis has some other features you don’t often see at this price point. The keyboard is backlit, which is a huge surprise. It also offers a comfortable typing experience, with satisfying keys that are still quiet. I’m picky about touchpads, but this one is quite roomy, with a smooth Gorilla Glass surface — I’d choose it over plenty of touchpads I’ve used on multi-thousand dollar Windows laptops. And you get a good, modern port selection including two USB Type-C ports (supporting USB 3.2 Gen 1, DisplayPort, and DC-in), one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and a 3.5mm combination audio jack. There’s a USB-C on both sides, which I’m very happy about for charging convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CQKU0"&gt;But the biggest highlight for me is the display. I generally expect to see bad panels at the $349 price point — the Flex 3 and the C340 are both small (11.6 inches), low-resolution (1366 x 768), and dim. But the Spin 513 has a quite nice 1920 x 1080 screen, which is as good of a resolution as you’ll ever see on any laptop at this price. It delivers a crisp picture, and it gets bright enough for even some outdoor use (if you’re in the shade). If you’re looking for an affordable Netflix machine, the Spin is a great candidate — especially given its movie-friendly 16:9 aspect ratio. Oh, and it even has USI stylus support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8K1F"&gt;My one disappointment was audio. The Spin comes with two stereo speakers, as well as two microphones. The Chromebook delivered decent volume — certainly enough to fill a room — but percussion was tinny as I listened to music, and you can forget about bass entirely. I also heard some occasional distortion at maximum volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 keyboard deck seen from above, angled slightly to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YHY6qzs01ejvZ-_snRtqbGa-v8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480600/mchin_20190722_4563_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer calls this the “FineTip” keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SySAnv"&gt;Inside, the 7c processor comes paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Some models will support LTE connectivity, though my test unit did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7n7ej"&gt;The 7c certainly works — but the experience was a bit slow. I’ve been using the Spin as my primary work driver for a week, and I was able to get done &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the things I needed to — Google Docs for work, emailing, tweeting, etc. But I got impatient at times. Resizing a window or sending it to fullscreen, for example, takes just a bit longer than it does on $600 devices. There were occasions where my Google Doc would freeze, and I’d have to wait a couple seconds to resume working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krtsMq"&gt;Unlike with ARM Windows machines, the Spin 513 doesn’t come with restrictions on which Android apps you can download. But some of them were glitchy. Slack, for example, was only usable in a tiny phone-sized window, and completely froze whenever I tried to fullscreen it. Gmail also occasionally froze when I tried to archive messages by swiping, and I sometimes had to repeat the action. I didn’t have either issue when using the same apps on the Intel-based Flex 3 last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxilwd"&gt;And some things didn’t work at all. Zoom meetings in the Zoom app weren’t possible on this device — despite using the same internet connection I always use, my audio lagged so far behind on calls that people couldn’t understand me. Editing a batch of photos in Google Photos was also a slow and stuttery experience that I wouldn’t recommend. It’s hard to know whether these can be attributed to Snapdragon compatibility issues that will improve over time, or whether they’re beyond what the processor can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2f13N"&gt;Now, none of this means the Spin 513 is a bad laptop. But it does mean I’m not the target audience for this Chromebook, and my standard office workload is a bit above its ideal ceiling. You certainly wouldn’t want to use this if you’re doing anything more than what I was doing. That includes anything elaborate with Linux, and anything that requires an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 seen from the left, half open, on a stone bench.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just want to Zoom, man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The top right corner of the Acer Chromebook Spin 513 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zh9C9sBOdlE-jNkt7Lh7LNexA0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480599/mchin_20190722_4563_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No fingerprint sensor on this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="50oFTc"&gt;For comparison, the Spin 513 is largely competing with Mediatek and Intel Celeron machines. It’s difficult to compare the Snapdragon 7c to these chipsets (in terms of power) because their architecture is completely different. The best I can say is that anecdotally, I had a slightly faster experience on the Flex 3 with the Celeron N4020. Zoom calls were more feasible on that machine (though they were still bad). With that said, I don’t think the difference is noticeable enough to make the Flex 3 a better buy unless you’re really picky. Both devices are really only meant for basic tasks. Think more elementary school level as opposed to high school or college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ROe2l7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10475715"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvD5rQ"&gt;The flipside of this low performance is that the Spin’s battery life is really excellent. I averaged 10 hours and 15 minutes to a charge. That was continuous use, with a more intense workload than anyone should really be putting this Chromebook through, and screen brightness at 50 percent. If your brightness will be lower, you’re doing easier things than I am, and you’re taking some breaks (likely on all three counts), I imagine you’ll be able to go a couple days without needing an outlet. The 45W charger is also quite small, and won’t add much weight to your backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 513 sits on a stone bench, open. The screen displays a pastoral scene." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kISaT_FNIA5KDjORQajNlqumZDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22480592/mchin_20190722_4563_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No glare here. (This was in the shade.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q06Nvf"&gt;The big question with a Chromebook that costs $399.99 is whether the drawbacks are things you can live with. In this case, the big drawback (and the big area where the Spin 513 is a bit behind competitors) is the processor and the limited RAM. It’s important to understand what this system &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;made to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fspPs7"&gt;But if you’re mostly looking for YouTube and light browsing, this Chromebook is definitely the best value I’ve seen at its price point. When it comes to the keyboard, touchpad, and screen, as well as the sturdy build, hinge, and modern port selection, it’s more comparable to something like the $649 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt; than to other budget Chromebooks like the Flex 3 and the C340. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9pMtg"&gt;The more interesting comparison is to Lenovo’s $279 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chromebook Duet,&lt;/a&gt; which also comes with 4GB of RAM, as well as a MediaTek chip. If you’re open to a tablet form factor, that device has better battery life, and its processor flies. But it’s also quite a small device (10.1 inches), so it won’t be a better buy if you’re looking for a full-sized laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yWpAa"&gt;The Chromebook Spin 513 won’t be for everyone. But it’s certainly the device it set out to be — a long-lasting, portable machine for light workloads — and if you’re shopping in the $399 range, it’s certainly worth a look. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft wants to reduce its Xbox store cut and shake up console gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8MpbBOLoTfsXQZzhzATOhiw224=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69222090/acastro_210429_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yeZTYx"&gt;Microsoft has been planning to cut its Xbox store cut to just 12 percent, according to confidential documents filed in the Epic Games vs. Apple case. The software maker details its store fees and changes in a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.551.7.pdf"&gt;document from January&lt;/a&gt;, where it also lists the 12 percent cut to PC games it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;announced this week&lt;/a&gt;. While most of the important parts of the document are redacted, one page reveals Microsoft also wants to reduce its 30 percent store cut on the Xbox console side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxjUaN"&gt;A table reveals “all games will move to 88 / 12 in CY21,” which means Microsoft had been planning a significant cut to Xbox transactions for some point in the 2021 calendar year. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;Microsoft has announced its PC cut&lt;/a&gt;, which is also listed in the same table, the company has stayed quiet about any Xbox plans. A change to 12 percent would be significant, particularly because Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo all currently take 30 percent on digital game sales.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_qa0SW4eWNY7v2T2R3rj2T2WzI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486068/TVaAAxV.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s confidential plans from January.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AlBZzl"&gt;“We have no plans to change the revenue share for console games at this time,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;about these documents. That suggests these plans have either fallen through, changed significantly from January, or Microsoft isn’t ready to announce any changes yet. Either way, Microsoft has clearly been planning this change, and wants to cut its Xbox fees somehow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKwr0w"&gt;This document is part of the Epic Games vs. Apple trial that commences on Monday, and there could be questions over Microsoft’s fee plans here. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;Both Epic and Apple are calling on&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s Lori Wright, VP of Xbox business development, as a third-party witness next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z2Mni"&gt;The documents also reveal that Microsoft had been planning to adopt this lower store rate on the PC side with an important caveat. “There is a proposal currently under Gaming Leadership Team consideration to adopt 88 / 12 as a public PC games revenue share for &lt;em&gt;all games&lt;/em&gt; in exchange for the grant of streaming rights to Microsoft,” reveals the document. We asked Microsoft whether this proposal went ahead, but the company refused to comment in time for publication. Microsoft is planning to cut its share of revenue for PC games to 12 percent in August, but it’s not clear if the streaming rights clause is still included. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jC6rLRv_T5XQo4DTfziJzSNxifI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486069/QRSIzcT.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft may have a caveat for the PC gaming cut.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VxcEbq"&gt;The streaming rights clause would mean developers have to ensure games are available on xCloud for this improved revenue cut. Cloud gaming rights, and in particular Xbox Game Pass, have becoming an emerging battle ground for console exclusivity rights in many contracts recently. Nvidia also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing"&gt;generated pushback from publishers and developers&lt;/a&gt; after publishing some games to its GeForce Now cloud gaming service without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpihoZ"&gt;Any changes to Xbox store fees in exchange for streaming rights would put pressure on Sony, Nintendo, Valve, and even Apple. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;As we noted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has also been quietly backing Epic Games’ action against Apple. Microsoft has previously defended its 30 percent cut for Xbox digital game sales, and Epic Games has been happy to keep it in place. “Game consoles are specialized devices optimized for a particular use,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/08/app-store-fairness-caf-interoperability-principles/"&gt;said Rima Alaily&lt;/a&gt;, deputy general counsel at Microsoft, last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8cMhq"&gt;Alaily argues that the “business model for game consoles is very different to the ecosystem around PCs or phones,” because Microsoft subsidizes the hardware and consoles “are vastly outnumbered in the marketplace by PCs and phones.” An Epic Games executive also revealed in a court deposition this week that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;company has never sought to negotiate&lt;/a&gt; with Microsoft to avoid using its commerce engine on Xbox. Despite defending its Xbox cut, Microsoft did admit last year that the company has “more work to do to establish the right set of principles for game consoles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtrrOV"&gt;Elsewhere, another confidential document shines a light on exclusivity with Xbox games. &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt; is listed with a three-month console exclusivity deal, &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected &lt;/em&gt;with six months of exclusivity on connected updates, and &lt;em&gt;The Gunk&lt;/em&gt; with perpetual exclusivity to Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vg5aZZBwqbGqCKtuoMSr3lsQPmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22486070/G6ckBUj.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The court documents also detail Xbox exclusivity deals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u77jhz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, May 2nd 6:50AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with additional streaming rights details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As Epic v. Apple approaches the courtroom, Valve is getting sued over Steam too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Steam Box Header alt 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b0N3Bi3b0ocvgPZlxBIRwhd7o98=/8x0:1013x670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69220436/steam_box_header_alt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrKVAp"&gt;Just two days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Apple gets dragged into a California court&lt;/a&gt; to justify its 30 percent App Store fee — and two days after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;axed its 30 percent cut on PC&lt;/a&gt; — we’re learning that gaming giant Valve is now facing down lawsuits against its own 30 percent cut and alleged anticompetitive practices with its PC gaming platform Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PA9iFx"&gt;“Valve abuses its market power to ensure game publishers have no choice but to sell most of their games through the Steam Store, where they are subject to Valve’s 30% toll,” argues indie game developer and &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33272/GDC_2011_Humble_Indie_Bundle_Creators_Talk_Inspiration_Execution.php"&gt;Humble Bundle creator&lt;/a&gt; Wolfire Games, in a lawsuit filed Tuesday (via &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/humble-bundle-creator-brings-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-over-steam/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okv3S3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clear parallels to Epic v. Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5SABB"&gt;Much like Epic v. Apple, the new suit argues that a platform owner is using an effective monopoly over the place where people &lt;em&gt;run &lt;/em&gt;their software (there, iOS; here, Steam) to dominate and tax an entire separate industry (alternative app / game stores), an industry that could theoretically flourish and produce lower prices for consumers if not for (Apple’s / Valve’s) iron grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Glk30U"&gt;Wolfire claims that Valve now controls “approximately 75 percent” of the entire PC gaming market, reaping an estimated $6 billion in annual revenue as a result from that 30 percent fee alone — over $15 million per year per Valve employee, assuming the company still has somewhere in the vicinity of the 360 employees &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-misses-deadline-to-respond-to-washington-state-gambling-regulator-but-says-its-coming-soon/"&gt;it confirmed having five years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATDBol"&gt;As to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Valve might be abusing its power, there’s a laundry list of complaints that you might want to read in full (which is why I’ve embedded the complaint below), but the arguments seem to boil down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zn2Kxd"&gt;Every other company’s attempt to compete with Steam has failed to make a dent, even though many of them offered developers a bigger cut of the profits, such as the Epic Game Store’s 88-percent revenue share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qm0oks"&gt;Steam doesn’t allow publishers to sell PC games and game keys for less money elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="It91Pm"&gt;That in turn means rival game platforms can’t compete on price, which keeps them from getting a foothold &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OAW0GX"&gt;Most of those rival game stores have largely given up, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937055/ea-games-steam-access-subscription-service-pc-storefront-jedi-fallen-order-sales"&gt;like how EA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;Microsoft have each&lt;/a&gt; brought their games back to Steam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TwWpGS"&gt;That ensures Steam stays the dominant platform, because companies that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have become competitors are reduced to simply feeding the Steam engine with their games or selling Steam keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="rV2Q2R"&gt;Wolfire says that the Humble Bundle in particular has been a victim of Valve’s practices — the lawsuit claims that “publishers became more and more reluctant to participate in Humble Bundle events, decreasing the quantity and quality of products available to Humble Bundle customers,” because they feared retaliation if Humble Bundle buyers resold their Steam keys on the grey market for cheap — and though Valve once worked with Humble Bundle &lt;a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/212341218-How-to-link-your-Steam-account?mobile_site=true"&gt;on a keyless direct integration&lt;/a&gt;, the lawsuit claims that Valve abruptly pulled the plug on that partnership with no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsbqq1"&gt;As you’d expect, the lawsuit doesn’t waste much ink considering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; gamers might prefer Steam to the likes of EA’s Origin or Microsoft’s Windows Store &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; the simple matter of price; I’d argue most Steam competitors have been somewhat deficient when it comes to addressing PC gamers’ many wants and needs. But that doesn’t excuse Valve’s anticompetitive practices, assuming these claims are true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGDf3j"&gt;Valve didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KKMYpG"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20695071-wolfire-games-v-valve-corporation-complaint/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Wolfire Games v. Valve Corporation complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhk7YA"&gt;This isn’t the first lawsuit brought against Valve; a group of individual game buyers &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-30-new-lawsuit-accuses-valve-of-abusing-steam-market-power-to-prevent-price-competition"&gt;filed a fairly similar complaint in January&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve embedded the new amended version of that complaint below as well. But that earlier complaint also accused game companies alongside Valve — this new one lawsuit is by a game company itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cve2Zn"&gt;Each suit is hoping to win class-action status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gm40hE"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20695227-colvin-et-al-vs-valve-corp-amended-complaint/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Colvin et al. vs. Valve Corp, amended complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="udhOLu"&gt;Whether these plaintiffs succeed against Valve or no, the pressure is clearly mounting to reduce these app store fees across the industry, and Valve may have a harder time justifying them than most — it’s seemingly more dominant in the PC gaming space than either Apple or Google are in the smartphone one, even if there are far fewer PC gamers than phone users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOakF9"&gt;Valve also hasn’t necessarily made a huge concession to game developers so far. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120577/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition"&gt;Valve did adjust its revenue split to give bigger companies more money,&lt;/a&gt; reducing its 30 percent cut to 25 percent after a developer racks up $10 million in sales, and down to 20 percent after they hit $50 million. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;Apple and Google drop their cuts to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; for developers with under $1 million in sales, theoretically helping smaller developers instead of bigger ones.) But the Epic Games Store only takes 12 percent, and Microsoft’s Windows Store just copied that lead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;by dropping its 30 percent cut to 12 percent as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSDYir"&gt;The EU may also add additional pressure in the future; yesterday, European Commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager revealed it would also “take an interest in the gaming app market” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;following its conclusion that Apple has broken EU antitrust laws &lt;/a&gt;around music streaming apps. The European Commission already has Valve on its radar, too; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240330/valve-steam-geo-blocking-european-commission-eu-fine-bandai-namco-capcom-focus-home-zenimax"&gt;it fined the company earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for geo-blocking game sales.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Newsmax apologizes to employee of Dominion Voting Systems over false election accusations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twOsONtJWnZyTK4DNlnkzGXBf9A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69220249/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fnBX7N"&gt;Conservative news channel Newsmax has posted an apology to an employee of Dominion Voting Systems, after it reported without evidence that he was involved in manipulating results of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lcIks"&gt;“On behalf of Newsmax, we would like to apologize for any harm that our reporting of the allegations against Dr. Coomer may have caused to Dr. Coomer and his family,” &lt;a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/eric-coomer-dominion-voting-systems/2021/04/30/id/1019671/"&gt;a statement posted to Newsmax’s website states&lt;/a&gt;. According to the statement, there was no substance to the allegations made about Eric Coomer, Dominion’s director of product strategy and security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bcWHOe"&gt;“Newsmax would like to clarify its coverage of Dr. Coomer and note that while Newsmax initially covered claims by President Trump’s lawyers, supporters and others that Dr. Coomer played a role in manipulating Dominion voting machines, Dominion voting software, and the final vote counts in the 2020 presidential election, Newsmax subsequently found no evidence that such allegations were true. Many of the states whose results were contested by the Trump campaign after the November 2020 election have conducted extensive recounts and audits, and each of these states certified the results as legal and final.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ39JX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/dominion-worker-eric-coomer-sues-trump-campaign-conservative-media-n1252205"&gt;Coomer filed a lawsuit in December&lt;/a&gt; against Newsmax, One America News Network, the Trump campaign, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and other people and groups that spread the false reports that Coomer had somehow rigged the election against the former president. His &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484940/Complaint_20201222_Eric_Coomer_Suit.pdf"&gt;attorneys wrote in their complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Coomer had been “vilified and subjected to an onslaught of offensive messages and harassment” as a result of the false claims. Coomer was forced to go into hiding following numerous death threats, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAG7zf"&gt;In its statement, Newsmax said that it had  “found no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so. Nor has Newsmax found any evidence that Dr. Coomer ever participated in any conversation with members of ‘Antifa,’ nor that he was directly involved with any partisan political organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNrUwi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/newsmax-apologizes-to-dominion-worker-for-false-allegations/2021/04/30/39945c04-a9f9-11eb-a8a7-5f45ddcdf364_story.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Coomer has dropped Newsmax from his lawsuit, and his attorney confirmed that Coomer had reached a settlement agreement with the network, but declined to disclose the terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeGqIX"&gt;Despite the glut of conspiracy theories, there has been no evidence there was any manipulation of November’s election results. &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election"&gt;According to a November 13th statement&lt;/a&gt; from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the November 3rd election “was the most secure in American history.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic-backed expert says Apple’s app store profit is as high as 78 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUiI_MPTLosJoewIUa2j5t8SLnw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69219619/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9a9cP"&gt;An expert witness for Epic Games testified that Apple’s App Store had operating margins above 70 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484513/ned_barnes_testimony.pdf"&gt;new court documents show.&lt;/a&gt;  Ned Barnes testified that information from Apple’s Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis group show the App Store had a 77.8 percent operating margin in 2019, and 74.9 percent in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPK8V"&gt;The figures are close to Barnes’ calculations of the App Store’s profits, he testified, and “also refute criticisms of my report proffered by certain Apple expert witnesses that it is not possible to calculate reliably or usefully the operating margins of the App Store.” Barnes also testified that Apple has been tracking its App Store profits for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGe68"&gt;Apple has hotly contested that interpretation of the data. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s chief compliance officer said at a congressional hearing last month that “we don’t have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store,” and that Cook has made similar statements about the App Store and how it’s structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8YE6T"&gt;An Apple spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that Barnes’ figures were incorrect: “Epic’s experts calculations of the operating margins for the App Store are simply wrong and we look forward to refuting them in court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7wd8x"&gt;The question of how much profit Apple makes from the app store is at the center of the ongoing court case between Apple and Epic Games. Epic argues that the App Store provides no real service, but simply serves as a way for Apple to extract money from developers. Epic is suing Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;for antitrust violations&lt;/a&gt; on those grounds, after launching an unauthorized in-app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;payments system for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. But Apple insists the App Store review process is a pivotal part of the broader platform safety efforts around iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQsHN3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22484567/schmalensee_testimony.pdf"&gt;Court documents show Apple’s expert witness Richard Schmalensee&lt;/a&gt; also disputed Barnes/Epic’s figures. “Mr. Barnes’ estimate of the App Store’s operating margin is unreliable because it looks in isolation at one segment of the iOS ecosystem in a way that artificially boosts the apparent operating margin of that segment,” Schmalensee said in his written direct testimony. “When one looks at Apple’s device and services ecosystem as a whole, the operating margin falls to an unremarkable level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Un5tXR"&gt;Schmalensee further testified that “it makes no sense” to try to measure the App Store’s profitability in isolation since it’s part of the iOS platform and relies on all of Apple’s intellectual property. “As top Apple executives will testify, Apple does not calculate P&amp;amp;Ls by products and services because they view it as an unproductive exercise,” according to Schmalensee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Iroz"&gt;Court proceedings for the trial are due to begin on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California appeals court finds Amazon responsible for third party sellers’ products</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VZB0njmuI4Qv0iAMUtXOJySSPI4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218814/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9PXCby"&gt;An appeals court in California has ruled that Amazon can be held liable for products sold through its marketplace by a third-party seller, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-04-29/column-amazon-product-safety-ruling"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367966/amazon-liable-defective-products-california-marketplace-third-party"&gt;second major case in California&lt;/a&gt; where an appeals court has rejected Amazon’s long-held position that it is merely an intermediary between buyers and its third-party sellers. Amazon collectively refers to these sellers as its “Amazon Marketplace” even though it’s not a separate or distinct part of Amazon’s website. Third-party sellers’ products typically appear in Amazon listings, with a small line of text to indicate that Amazon itself is not the actual seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1iZvC"&gt;At issue was the case of a woman who suffered burn injuries after a hoverboard she purchased on Amazon in 2015 via a third party merchant caught on fire. Amazon argued that it was merely the platform connecting customers with sellers, but the appeals court found there was a “direct link in the vertical chain of distribution under California’s strict liability doctrine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cezcp1"&gt;Christopher Dolan, an attorney for the plaintiff in the hoverboard case, said in a statement that the ruling was a major victory for consumers. “Amazon can’t escape liability for defective products it sells to consumers by claiming it is not involved in the marketing, sale and distribution of goods and is just an ‘advertiser,’” Dolan said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Wgf74"&gt;Last August, the California Fourth District Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21758700/Bolger_Opinion_8_13_20.pdf"&gt;reversed a 2019 trial court ruling&lt;/a&gt;, reinstating claims from a woman who says she suffered third-degree burns when a defective laptop battery she bought from a third-party seller on Amazon caught fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAB2nJ"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. A spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; that it “invests heavily in the safety and authenticity of all products offered in our store, including proactively vetting sellers and products before being listed, and continuously monitoring our store for signals of a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sry1k3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Netflix executive convicted of money laundering</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRUdCXDcN8rEOz0gvk8Ih-0rijQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218532/acastro_200302_3922_SuperTuesday_gavel.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzYZzt"&gt;A former Netflix executive was convicted of taking bribes and kickbacks from vendors doing business with the company, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-netflix-executive-convicted-receiving-bribes-and-kickbacks-companies-contracting"&gt;according to the US Department of Justice. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uh8mBU"&gt;Michael Kail, who was Netflix’s vice president of information technology operations from 2011 to 2014, was found guilty by a jury of money laundering, and wire and mail fraud. According to the DOJ, Kail used his position at the company to “unlock a stream of cash and stock kickbacks” for himself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHHx84"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-26/netflix-claims-former-executive-took-kickbacks-on-sales"&gt;Netflix sued Kail in 2014&lt;/a&gt; claiming he hid payments from vendors by directing them to his personal consulting company. According to the DOJ, Kail accepted bribes totaling more than $500,000, as well as stock options from nine tech companies that provided products or services to Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcnKea"&gt;Kail’s attorney Julia Mezhinsky Jayne said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they were disappointed in the verdict, which she called “inexplicable and clearly unsupported by the actual evidence and the law.” They plan to appeal. Jayne said Kail was “a tremendous asset to Netflix and helped drive their success as a cutting-edge technology company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6OSzB"&gt;Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdPaP4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
