    <title>Twitter launches new process for reporting COVID misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOR5shwF0-aU9ukrxB1rgkeFw-4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737830/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="euxgUJ"&gt;On Tuesday, Twitter announced that it will begin testing a new reporting feature for users to flag tweets containing possible misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYkvnT"&gt;Starting today, users will be able to report misinformation through the same process as harassment or other harmful content, through the dropdown menu at the top right of every tweet. Users will be prompted to select whether the misleading comment is political, health-related, or falls into another category. The politics category includes more specific forms of misinformation like content related to elections. The health category will also include an option for users to flag COVID-19-specific misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQcwqx"&gt;The new feature will be available on Tuesday for most users in the US, Australia, and South Korea. Twitter said it expects to run this experiment for a few months before deciding to roll it out to additional markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XGfbHy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not every report will be reviewed &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3hl0iZ"&gt;Twitter said that not every report will be reviewed as the platform continues to test the feature. But the data obtained through the test will help the company determine how it could expand on the feature over the next few weeks. The test could be used to identify tweets containing misinformation that have the potential to go viral as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxkvLZ"&gt;Last month, the Biden administration took a stronger stance against misinformation as new variants of COVID-19 have continued to spread. President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; in July that social media platforms like Facebook were “killing people” with vaccine misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="916uUj"&gt;The statement followed a coordinated campaign from the White House pressuring platforms to more aggressively remove coronavirus misinformation. The US Surgeon General’s office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; outlining new ways platforms could counter health misinformation. The report called for “clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate” a platform’s rules and for companies like Facebook and Twitter to redesign their algorithms to “avoid amplifying” false information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQUHIY"&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588903/covid19-misinformation-section-230-facebook-joe-biden-white-house"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that would remove Facebook and other social media platforms’ Section 230 liability shield if they amplified harmful public health information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon removed Hub lockers from two Chicago parks after public outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_efPfqG5MR83nWxsJlKrAxhAVY=/0x131:2016x1475/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737633/AmazonHubLockerChicaog.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqdLdl"&gt;Amazon has removed two of its Hub lockers from parks in Chicago after public outcry over blocked sidewalks, &lt;a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/08/14/amazon-removes-delivery-lockers-from-chicago-parks-after-furor-over-installing-them-on-sidewalks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Club Chicago&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. While they offer a convenient place to pick up packages and drop off returns, a locker making a public park less accessible might not be the kind of tradeoff even a devoted Amazon customer is comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkvVEF"&gt;Photos shared by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426215483288788995?s=20"&gt;33rd Ward Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; make it pretty clear how egregious the placement was, at least in Brands Park. Technically, you could still roll by the locker and get to the rest of the park, but that possibility goes away as soon as someone stands in front to get something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="80TtXv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; I’ve spent a good part of my morning handling the placement of an Amazon box at a park in my ward. On this instance apparently it was installed in the wrong spot &amp;amp; will be moved. But the fact that Amazon gets to use our public parks for this because of austerity is enraging. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5Rbabgcwt7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5Rbabgcwt7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez    ✊    (@RossanaFor33) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426215483288788995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E6raE5"&gt;The natural response was outrage, including comments that the locker placement looked too absurd to be real. &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/chicago-park-district-remove-amazon-from-parks-keep-public-spaces-community-focused?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_30321202_en-US%3A4&amp;amp;recruiter=12705437&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_petition"&gt;An online petition followed&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RossanaFor33/status/1426976743592710144"&gt;the Brands Park locker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nadignewspapers.com/2021/08/13/amazon-hub-locker-to-be-removed-from-forest-glen-park-at-alderman-nugents-request-lockers-also-installed-at-rosedale-wilson-other-area-parks/?fbclid=IwAR223XuvVcGUOAV28bqlbtv1uiEH86AZ7v7Q9jHia4e3G8c9GW5mMj-5Yzo"&gt;another locker at the Forest Glen Playlot&lt;/a&gt; were removed. Amazon also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it plans to review future locations to prevent other problems. According to Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yF3h0Q"&gt;We value the community’s feedback and took immediate action to respond to these concerns, working with the Chicago Park District to remove the Amazon Locker. We are also reviewing our other Locker installations in partnership with Chicago Park District to ensure they are all located in appropriate areas that serve both customers and the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o8sNZa"&gt;What’s not entirely clear is how something like this happened. The Chicago Parks District tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it reviewed all of Amazon’s location choices beforehand “to ensure they met park needs,” but maybe sidewalk accessibility wasn’t a top priority? There’s also the larger question of why the city is cutting deals to put the private property of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;trillion-dollar companies&lt;/a&gt; in public parks in the first place. Rodriguez suggested to &lt;em&gt;Book Club Chicago&lt;/em&gt; that lockers popping up in parks is a result of underfunding: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5XsF5t"&gt;When you have public institutions that are not well-funded, and can’t function with the budget they’re provided by the government, they need to look for other sources of revenue. This is how we get a company like Amazon to have a presence in our public parks. It’s disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pECZU3"&gt;Whatever the reason, the slow creep of the private and paid into public goods like parks always feels icky. It seems like the Chicago Parks District still plans to move forward with its Amazon deal, but hopefully, future placements are more thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGmjIC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBawjB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME9nRr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf just made the iconic Aliens Pulse Rifle into a badass foam blaster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPwRB1yHQPSMmmqBJdPsTw84WaY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737604/Nerf_LMTD_Aliens_M41_A_3_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1JeqBn"&gt;That huge carry handle, pump-action underbarrel grenade launcher, and digital ammo counter on the side: is there a more iconic sci-fi weapon than the &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; M41A Pulse Rifle? Now, it’s about to become an iconic Nerf blaster as well, because Hasbro has just announced a $95 version that flings&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;foam darts — enough of them that it might actually be viable in a stock Nerf war! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uli7jYcmdqpnpsPpR_wOimuGN48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787876/aliens_nerf_pulse_rifle_spin_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f8dSCU"&gt;You see, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;Nerf’s $130 blaster rifle from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or most of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/6/17657140/nerf-overwatch-guns-foam-shooting-blasters-blizzard"&gt;its &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; toys&lt;/a&gt;, this 28-inch long blaster isn’t just a prop with a few token foam projectiles inside: it’s a fully-automatic blaster that takes Nerf Elite-sized dart magazines a la &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/RapidStrike_CS-18"&gt;the fan-favorite RapidStrike&lt;/a&gt;, powered by four C batteries, plus “movie-inspired blast sounds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV2waa"&gt;Oh, and Hasbro tells me that’s a genuine digital ammo counter on the side: it actually counts darts even if you hold the trigger down! The standard mag contains 10 darts, but it should fit less screen-accurate aftermarket ones to increase your capacity, and you can set the ammo counter as high as 99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7OGTna9zErJffeJvv-EgCo6Qs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787903/aliens_nerf_pulse_rifle_4.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gL8jbo"&gt;That underbarrel grenade launcher actually fires Nerf Mega darts (one at a time) and has a genuine spring-loaded plunger tube inside connected to a secondary trigger you can actually pull — unlike, say, the pitiful underbarrel rocket launcher on &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Demolisher_2-In-1"&gt;Nerf’s old Demolisher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/HAMP"&gt;similar blasters&lt;/a&gt; where you had to pull hard on a manual plunger to pop a rocket out. There doesn’t seem to be an internal magazine for additional Mega darts, though, so you might have to keep those in a pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NXY6VqAn5jRFCNnNk2tl49FhXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788025/Hasbro_Nerf_Aliens_Open2_FINAL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uaEXJ7"&gt;For years, toy blaster fans have been trying to replicate the features and functionality of the iconic &lt;em&gt;Aliens &lt;/em&gt;Pulse Rifle, converting their Thompson airsoft replicas and Nerf blasters into full-scale props. They’d often zip-tie or meld Nerf’s own blasters beneath their RapidStrikes or Stryfes to get an underbarrel blaster like this. My favorite so far is Campbell Nerf Works’ &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4569308"&gt;Stryfle, a 3D-printed set of parts&lt;/a&gt; you can use to combine a Stryfe and a handleless &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Magnus"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; to great effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="czKkO0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DreGO7bXpRQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xaHtIA"&gt;I’m actually working on a “Vitamin C Edition” of the Stryfle &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1427700378070503424"&gt;myself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hh7SZL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My in-progress Stryfle &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZFLKeUHGTZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZFLKeUHGTZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1427700378070503424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3kmW8"&gt;But now, you don’t need to be a modder to have a fully functioning &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; Pulse Rifle that fires Nerf darts and looks far more the part. Well, at least you don’t once &lt;em&gt;October 2022&lt;/em&gt; rolls around, because today’s preorders aren’t expected to ship for a very long while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpGKyK"&gt;And while $95 is a lot, it’s a good bit less than many of Hasbro’s other licensed collectibles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18760160/nerf-overwatch-soldier-76-blaster-hasbro"&gt;like the $130 Soldier 76 pulse rifle from &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not every day Hasbro gets a licensed blaster right (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;I lay out some examples here&lt;/a&gt;), but this feels like it might be one of them. You can find preorders &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/nerf-lmtd-aliens-m41-a-blaster"&gt;at Hasbro Pulse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=Verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-games%2Fnerf%2Fproducts%2Fnerf-aliens-lmtd-aliens-m41a-pulse-blaster%2F11155847.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, with EB Games Canada to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says SharePlay won’t be part of initial iOS 15 release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV1QOYraAdCGnrD9LKF3x-VKrc=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737506/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCkPhu"&gt;One of iOS 15’s marquee new features, SharePlay, has been delayed and now won’t be rolled out until after the major update is released this fall. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/"&gt;Apple has informed developers&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will be disabled in the next betas of iOS 15, iPadOS15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. SharePlay allows people to enjoy entertainment (TV shows, movies, music, etc.) together at the same time and syncs everything up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlzp23"&gt;The company has confirmed that this feature will be absent in the official release of iOS 15 when it widely rolls out in the fall. Apple now says that SharePlay will return “in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOg5i"&gt;“We’re thrilled with the high level of enthusiasm we’ve seen from the developer community for SharePlay, and we can’t wait to bring it to users so that they can experience your apps with their friends and family in a whole new way,” Apple said in its update to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4G10w"&gt;This is the first major new aspect of iOS 15 to be pulled back from the launch release, but it will undoubtedly raise questions about which other features might also have to wait for a later update. Apple has yet to include Universal Control, one of the most impressive tricks it showed off at WWDC, in any of this summer’s beta releases. Universal Control will allow iPad and Mac owners to work seamlessly across both products with the same keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLdpC"&gt;Apple has held back some of its promised features from previous major iOS releases until they were more polished and ready to go. As just one example, Group FaceTime was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684154/apple-group-facetime-chats-delay-ios-12"&gt;delayed from the initial release of iOS 12&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 until a smaller update that rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18040034/apple-ios-12-1-release-date-october-30-features-group-facetime-beautygate"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAdXX"&gt;Check out our preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; for a rundown of all the new features that Apple says will be available — at some point, anyway — later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thrilling new trailer for Star Wars’ anime anthology series is filled with action and style</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4Fx6o"&gt;Disney has shared an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAsl-0o3O0"&gt;impressive trailer for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its anime anthology series premiering September 22nd on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1128412/9358?subId1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus.&lt;/a&gt; The trailer oozes style and flair, and it looks like the series will tell some thrilling new stories in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTxk8H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; will feature nine animated shorts from seven anime studios. Disney also revealed the English dub voice cast, which features some big names including Alison Brie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Harbour, Neil Patrick Harris, Lucy Liu, and Temuera Morrison (who is reprising his role as Boba Fett). You can see more of the cast here on &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-visions-trailer-and-cast"&gt;the official &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;. And Disney says that you’ll be able to watch the series both with the English dub cast and the original Japanese voice cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTtHZ9"&gt;The series is the latest &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; show to hit Disney Plus. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; premiered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418964/star-wars-the-bad-batch-disney-plus-streaming"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; series on the horizon, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a spinoff starring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168641/star-wars-andor-cassian-disney-plus-2022-diego-luna"&gt;Diego Luna as Cassian Andor from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones appear again in leaked promotional photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-F405X-1BdHBLozQ7-qZT3RG88s=/0x0:1025x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737199/1DCA3BF9_1097_47CE_BF94_B3A57331EC07.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfMEWb"&gt;After first surfacing last month in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583264/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-qc45-fcc-filing-leak"&gt;an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; (which Bose quickly withdrew), the company’s upcoming QuietComfort 45 headphones have now been leaked more extensively &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html"&gt;courtesy of &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Set to be priced at $329, the QC45s certainly look the part of a successor to the popular QC35s. The overall design is very similar, with some modern refinements like a USB-C port thrown in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoVaAr"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the QC45s will offer active noise cancellation, an Aware Mode for piping in outside noise, and be tuned with Bose’s signature Active EQ. Battery life is expected to be up to 24 hours of continuous playback. A quick 15-minute charge will give the headphones 2.5 hours of listening time. Multipoint pairing to two devices at the same time will be supported. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-N2iBnHsDVWeDgAcbRgCixkB970=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787786/CB3B0436_173C_43FB_9B53_DD2757BB905F.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124669.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QC45s looks very similar to the prior QC35II headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zT8MDP"&gt;Bose’s last flagship headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a much different, more premium design than the QC35s. They also gave customers more control over the balance of noise cancellation and ambient sound. But they came with their own set of tradeoffs. The headphones couldn’t be folded down for compact storage, and they couldn’t match the airy comfort of Bose’s prior cans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOCgLy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t know how strong the ANC on the QC45s will be, but Bose has every reason to exceed expectations. With the QC35 and QC35II headphones, there was a long saga where some customers insisted that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696186/bose-qc35ii-headphones-worse-noise-cancellation-problems"&gt;noise cancellation had been rendered less effective&lt;/a&gt; after a firmware update. There were enough complaints for Bose to conduct an in-depth examination of the perceived problem, and it even sought out independent third-party testing. But the company ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209974/bose-qc35-qc35ii-noise-canceling-investigation-firmware"&gt;concluded that its firmware hadn’t caused any ANC degradation&lt;/a&gt; and pointed to “hardware related issues with ear cushions, aftermarket parts, or mechanical integrity” as the reason some customers ran into problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOs2xF"&gt;With the QuietComfort 45s leaking to this degree, it seems an official release can’t be that much farther off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 to require proof of vaccination for attendees, exhibitors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The 2017 Consumer Electronics Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/on9xFC5AOs8eX89IBNpF98XI8sA=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737042/631003660.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9okc1"&gt;After an online-only event this year, the CTA is still planning to put on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407494/ces-2022-in-person-conference-event-tech-show-las-vegas-january"&gt;CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; as a hybrid event with in-person and digital components. Today &lt;a href="https://www.ces.tech/News/Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=c2667de6-cc7d-4887-beb7-e216f165a584"&gt;the CTA announced&lt;/a&gt; that if you’re planning on showing up in Las Vegas, then you will need to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uv8nzp"&gt;PROOF OF COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIRED&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHhcSr"&gt;On August 17, CTA announced that all attendees and exhibitors will need to show proof of vaccination in order to attend CES. CTA continues to monitor guidelines for health safety measures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nevada and Clark County. CTA will follow applicable federal, state and local laws, adapting CES plans accordingly and sharing updates with you and other CES audiences. We are also working closely with the Las Vegas community, including the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, exhibit venues and hotels, and if they adjust their plans, we will communicate that as well. While the situation will continue to evolve over the coming months, read the information below for just some of the precautions we will implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DBYUtc"&gt;Navigating the CES show floor without picking up an infectious disease is tricky even when there isn’t a global pandemic, so the guidelines shouldn’t come as a surprise. The announcement comes at the same time as New York City rolls out its&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607882/key-to-nyc-pass-covid-vaccine-proof-new-york-city"&gt; Key to NYC Pass&lt;/a&gt; plan, and concert promoter &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/live-nation-updates-covid-19-vaccination-negative-test-1212323/"&gt;Live Nation says it will require vaccination or a negative test&lt;/a&gt; for attendees and crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdLSeL"&gt;As far as those who are not vaccinated, whether by their own choice or because they live somewhere without access to vaccines, the CTA says it’s “assessing the acceptance of proof of a positive antibody test as an alternative requirement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MJLmB"&gt;It’s also unknown how this will apply to events happening beyond the show floor and keynote ballrooms, or outside the CTA’s umbrella entirely. We expect to hear more details about all of this long before the CES 2022 media days start on January 3rd, or when the show floor opens on January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Platforms struggle with Taliban policy amid chaotic US withdrawal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Four men facing away from the camera carry military rifles along an empty street, flanked by concrete barriers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_pSXXPwdkdbfc9uWZERh8hz0LI=/0x0:4783x3189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736955/1234727262.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Taliban fighters patrol a road in Kabul | Photo by WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywR2hD"&gt;Social platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are coming under new scrutiny for the way they treat Taliban accounts, as the militant Islamist group emerges as the dominant power in Afghanistan in the wake of the US withdrawal. While none of the platforms have publicly changed their policies on the group, moderation practices have come under close scrutiny, and many are shifting resources to ensure the policies are appropriately enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRAVaz"&gt;A particular question &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/17/technology-202-facebook-twitter-youtube-face-high-stakes-question-whether-recognize-taliban/"&gt;raised by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is whether the group will be allowed to wrest control of the official Facebook and Twitter accounts for the government of Afghanistan. While the Taliban has seized effective control over the government, granting access to official accounts could be seen as legitimizing their control over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6TRkkB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JisP0r"&gt;Despite a number of official bans, Taliban forces appear to have embraced tech platforms when reclaiming territory. Early Monday, an official spokesperson for the Taliban &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1427126736026836995"&gt;used Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to claim control of the capital city of Kabul, saying the situation there was “under control.” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/taliban-leaders-used-twitter-and-whatsapp-to-help-capture-kabul/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Taliban officials were circulating WhatsApp numbers that could be used by former regime members to coordinate surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGljGP"&gt;The Taliban is officially banned from all Facebook services, including WhatsApp, but the service’s end-to-end encryption makes it easy for Taliban accounts to avoid moderation action. A WhatsApp spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; that moderators take action against violating accounts when moderators become aware of them — but without access to user communications, it is rare that WhatsApp would become aware of a Taliban account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmBSEg"&gt;Twitter does not have a blanket policy on Taliban activity, but told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it takes action against accounts violating existing rules against violent content or platform manipulation. “The situation in Afghanistan is rapidly evolving,” a spokesperson said. “We’re also witnessing people in the country using Twitter to seek help and assistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVHW1g"&gt;Reached for comment by The Verge, YouTube said it terminates all Taliban-linked accounts based on its interpretation of US sanctions law. “YouTube complies with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws, including relevant &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20061219"&gt;U.S. sanctions&lt;/a&gt;,” a representative said. “As such, if we find an account believed to be owned and operated by the Afghan Taliban, we terminate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Czo5"&gt;Facebook has designated the Taliban as a dangerous organization, which means it removes accounts representing the group and prohibits praise or support of it in user posts. The company has devoted more resources to enforcing that policy in light of the ongoing unrest in Kabul. Still, the company said it is waiting for guidance from outside organizations as to whether the Taliban should be recognized as the de facto government of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnF7yh"&gt;“Facebook does not make decisions about the recognized government in any particular country but instead respects the authority of the international community in making these determinations,” a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Regardless of who holds power, we will take the appropriate action against accounts and content that breaks our rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hswf54"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:10pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from YouTube spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 5A comes with a bigger battery and screen, smaller price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vCRMtLNtw-FxlEYDSAOV8ZwR-_I=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736882/Pixel_5a_5G_Product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 5A features a 6.34-inch display and IP67 water-resistance rating.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVJd9p"&gt;Google has officially revealed the Pixel 5A 5G, a phone it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;kind of announced in April&lt;/a&gt; to contradict rumors that it had been canceled. It comes with a short list of updated features compared to its 4A 5G predecessor, including a slightly bigger screen, a much bigger battery, and an IP67 rating for water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UkhGL"&gt;Few though they may be, these are some important tweaks to an already good midrange phone, and the best part is that the price has gotten smaller: in the US it will cost $449, which is $50 less than the Pixel 4A 5G’s introductory price. The 5A goes on sale in the US and Japan on August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dLQBUh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22392246"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUk7QBzrXEbAutV8xElm6bDgbU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786010/Pixel_5a_5G_Lifestyle_Charging__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 5A supports wired charging only, and Google says it’s the last Pixel phone that will ship with a charger in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dFP4Ys"&gt;The Pixel 5A’s screen gets a slight boost to 6.34 inches, a small increase over the 4A 5G’s 6.2-inch display. It’s still a 1080p OLED with a standard 60Hz refresh rate, despite rumors of a faster 90Hz display. The battery gets an increase to 4,680mAh, up from 3,885mAh, which Google says will last through a full day of typical use or two days using Extreme Battery Saver mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94D0WL"&gt;The 5A is also the first A-series Pixel to get an official water resistance rating. With IP67 protection, the phone is able to withstand immersion in up to three feet of water for up to 30 minutes. That’s an uncommon feature in the under-$500 class where IP ratings are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KozyrT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10704284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xagOMn"&gt;The Pixel 5A works on all major US carrier networks and continues to offer support for sub-6GHz 5G. Unlike last year, Google will not sell a mmWave-compatible version of the phone. That’s no great loss — mmWave 5G is very fast, but range is highly limited and hard to find. Unfortunately, the 5A is also missing support for C-band 5G frequencies, which Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T will start using at the end of this year to bolster their struggling nationwide 5G networks. Google says it could add the necessary software support later, but won’t commit to doing so at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9NKf7G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b0wE2W"&gt;Other specs remain unchanged from the previous model. It still uses a Snapdragon 765G chipset with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The 12.2-megapixel main and 16-megapixel ultrawide rear cameras and 8-megapixel selfie camera are the same. There’s a rear fingerprint scanner for biometric unlock, an honest-to-god headphone jack, and an 18W charger included in the box (Google says this will be the last Pixel phone to offer one). The phone will ship with Android 11 and is guaranteed Google’s standard three years of OS platform updates and security patch support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08GvuipPmUn5G-8Opsns7neL2YM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786075/Pixel_5a_5G_Cases_Lineup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case options for the Google Pixel 5A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tZCRck"&gt;Unlike the 4A 5G, the Google Pixel 5 won’t be sold through any of the major wireless carriers in the US. Instead, it’ll be offered directly from the Google Store and through Google Fi. It will be sold in just one finish — “mostly black” — with four colorful case options available separately to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Google Pixel 6 won’t ship with a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWtKPEFDCN0HQefeC0SXQdK8RF0=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69736930/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google joins Apple and Samsung by ditching the in-box charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hXmmGZ"&gt;Google is the latest manufacturer to bid farewell to the in-box charging brick, saying it expects the Pixel 5A will be the last phone to include one. That means the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; won’t include one when they arrive this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWjePu"&gt;The company says that most people already have a USB-C charging brick, so there’s no longer a need to include one with its phones. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231954/samsung-to-gradually-remove-chargers-earbuds-from-future-phones"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; made similar arguments when they announced they would no longer be offering an in-box charger. That may be true, but it’s likely that the cost savings of not including a charger played a big role in those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says it expects the Pixel 5A to be the last phone to include the charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aAa6hI"&gt;There’s also an environmental argument for ditching the charger: fewer redundant chargers being shipped to customers theoretically reduces e-waste. That’s tough to prove, though, and potentially just means that the greenhouse gas emissions of producing and shipping accessory chargers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;will be spread around between more companies&lt;/a&gt; as people buy them from third-party manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vxa6t"&gt;One thing seems certain, though: with these three major phone manufacturers committed to removing the charger, smaller companies will have an easier time following suit and doing the same. While phone shoppers may feel like it’s a case of paying the same price and getting less, this is likely a reality that we’ll all have to make peace with, so hold your wall chargers tight.&lt;/p&gt;
