    <title>Florida’s justification for raiding COVID data whistleblower Rebekah Jones is looking a little shaky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FE2cK9HKOihMIRe4DBVD7FdN8ak=/31x0:369x225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487687/emfGgCL9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Io8uS"&gt;On Tuesday, Florida state police entered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;the home of Rebekah Jones with guns drawn&lt;/a&gt;, seizing her computer and phone, in an attempt to prove that she’d sent an unauthorized “group text” through “a Department of Health messaging system” that is “to be used for emergencies only,” according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56danA"&gt;There are now two reasons why that’s significant. First, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160181/rebekah-jones-raid-seizure-search-warrant-covid-19-whistleblower-florida"&gt;as we reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Jones isn’t just any former Florida Department of Health employee: she’s the whistleblower who built Florida’s once-celebrated COVID-19 tracking dashboard, then accused her bosses &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;of ordering her to manipulate Florida’s data&lt;/a&gt; to justify reopening the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sKQUA"&gt;Second, it’s now come to our attention that the supposedly private messaging system that Jones might have accessed might have effectively just been an email address — an email address that the Florida Department of Health may have inadvertently published &lt;em&gt;for anyone to see&lt;/em&gt; on the open web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDfZdG"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/florida-posted-the-password-to-a-key-disaster-system-on-its-website/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, Redditors discovered that not only does the Florida Department of Health have a &lt;em&gt;single &lt;/em&gt;shared username and password, but that username and password is also freely accessible on the web. Here’s a redacted screenshot that Ars captured of &lt;em&gt;just one&lt;/em&gt; of at least seven PDFs that contain the information, PDFs that I also easily found with a Google search. All of them are still online at the time I type these words:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TzJL1qpK6DDyrbrNFX5OODbm0ls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158498/FLORIDA__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/florida-posted-the-password-to-a-key-disaster-system-on-its-website/" target="_blank"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qq8AHB"&gt;But it’s not just the username and password that are listed: these pages also have the email address of the exact group Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) claimed was hacked: “StateESF8.Planning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7b0yS"&gt;In the FDLE’s affidavit — which is how it got a search warrant for Jones’ home — the department characterizes StateESF8.Planning as a “multi-user account group” and talks about how Florida uses it to “coordinate the state’s health and medical resources, capabilities, and capacities.” That all sounds very official and important:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9sdmvWdxaQlhUGiIgheUjIj36k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158531/Clipboard01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small portion of the affadavit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0CuEXd"&gt;However, the publicly available usernames, passwords, and email addresses suggest it might have just been a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bog-standard mailing list with an awful lot of users, not something particularly private or secure. The email address still appears to be valid, though the Florida webmail application no longer seems to be online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrJ6s"&gt;None of this necessarily means that Jones didn’t send the message (though she &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/07/us/florida-search-warrant-raid-rebekah-jones-invs/index.html"&gt;vehemently denies she did&lt;/a&gt;). An FDLE agent under oath says the “group text” was specifically sent from a Comcast ID associated with her home address, and that’s why her home was raided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqY9v6"&gt;But if Jones did happen to send an email to a giant mailing list she used to be part of, one listed on the open web, would that be much of a crime? (I am not a lawyer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPbWgi"&gt;I asked the FDLE to explain how it could have been accessed illegally, if the email address might have required someone to use private credentials somehow, but a FLDE spokesperson declined, citing the active investigation, simply saying that my suggestions were “not accurate,” and that “this was not simply an email.” The Florida Department of Health didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhibof"&gt;On Wednesday, a Republican attorney appointed by Florida governor Ron DeSantis to nominate judges &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonGOPVet4Biden/status/1336339189374152704"&gt;resigned in protest&lt;/a&gt; over the raid on Jones’ house, calling it “unconscionable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YEnpjM"&gt;

    <title>Facebook calls antitrust lawsuits ‘revisionist history’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SLMvzV5m91Jp6dMakv-4w_xbZfo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487638/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bjt85p"&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of 48 state attorneys general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed broad antitrust charges against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a reversal of its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. Now, Facebook has responded to those charges in an extensive post titled &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/lawsuits-filed-by-the-ftc-and-state-attorneys-general-are-revisionist-history/"&gt;“Lawsuits Filed by the FTC and the State Attorneys General Are Revisionist History,”&lt;/a&gt; written by general counsel Jennifer Newstead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxvNUX"&gt;Newstead’s primary defense is that both acquisitions resulted in better products for consumers — an implicit reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21524886/google-market-power-justice-department-antitrust-lawsuit-consumer-harm"&gt;the “consumer harm” standard&lt;/a&gt; that has also been central to the Department of Justice’s case against Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fCzTtt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCDTzT"&gt;“These transactions were intended to provide better products for the people who use them, and they unquestionably did,” Facebook argues. “The FTC and states stood by for years while Facebook invested billions of dollars and millions of hours to make Instagram and WhatsApp into the apps that users enjoy today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCHvmU"&gt;Facebook also takes issue with the retroactive nature of the breakup. Both acquisitions are more than five years old, and were approved by regulatory agencies at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wlnq8U"&gt;“Regulators correctly allowed these deals to move forward because they did not threaten competition,” the post reads, detailing the FTC and European Commission reviews of the deals. “This lawsuit risks sowing doubt and uncertainty about the US government’s own merger review process and whether acquiring businesses can actually rely on the outcomes of the legal process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0TF6o"&gt;The question of retroactive review is an open topic in legal circles, but &lt;a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Menesh%20Patel.pdf"&gt;some scholars&lt;/a&gt; have argued it is beneficial for regulators to revisit previously cleared transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mynQrw"&gt;The post also directly addresses one if the central allegations of both lawsuits — that Facebook locks out potentially competitive products from its platform, starving competitors of a much-needed user base. This behavior was particularly stark in the case of Vine, which was locked out of Facebook’s social API functions as soon as it was acquired by Twitter, reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents"&gt;at the direction of Mark Zuckerberg himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF4RDA"&gt;In the post, Newstead claims this kind of API restriction is standard practice for platforms. “Where platforms give access to other developers — and many do not provide access at all — they usually prohibit duplication of core functions,” the post reads. “LinkedIn, The New York Times, Pinterest and Uber, to name a few, all have similar policies.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX flies Starship prototype rocket to highest altitude yet — but doesn’t stick the landing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-vtNxB2PzPrRUaWSt4PVtIlYmY=/0x21:1716x1165/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487628/starship.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecJeDn"&gt;During a test flight on Wednesday, SpaceX flew a prototype of its next generation Starship rocket to its highest height yet in the skies above Texas — but failed to stick the landing, with the vehicle exploding when it hit the ground. Propelled by three main engines, the vehicle launched to an altitude of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, before crash landing into the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Ef04"&gt;The nearly seven-minute test flight took off at around 5:45PM ET from SpaceX’s facility at Boca Chica, Texas. The prototype climbed to its target altitude, but during the flight, two of its three main engines seemingly shut down while it ascended. Eventually all three engines cut off, and SpaceX attempted to perform a “bell flop” maneuver, with the vehicle falling horizontally on the way down to Earth. Just before reaching the ground, the prototype reignited its engines — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336809767574982658?s=20"&gt;but the vehicle came in way too fast&lt;/a&gt; and blew apart when it hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P6UDVz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The flight was the most ambitious test yet of SpaceX’s Starship&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5zxMK"&gt;The flight was the most ambitious test yet of SpaceX’s Starship, meant to test out the launch and landing capabilities of the future rocket. Made out of a steel alloy, the silo-shaped rocket is supposed to act as a spaceship, a rocket, and a lander all in one, carrying people and cargo to deep-space destinations. SpaceX plans to launch the vehicle to orbit on another massive rocket called the Super Heavy. Once in space, Starship is supposed to use its main engines to land upright on other worlds — such as the Moon or Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu3jD5"&gt;Despite the explosive landing, SpaceX still considered the test a win. On its livestream of the event, the company included a banner that read: “Awesome test. Congrats Starship team!” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also expressed enthusiasm for the flight on Twitter, noting that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336808486022258688?s=20"&gt;the test succeeded in a number of its objectives&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier, Musk only gave the flight a one-third chance of success, noting that a “lot of things need to go right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MDuwR"&gt;Even before the flight occurred, SpaceX had noted on its website that completing a perfect flight wasn’t the marker for success. “With a test such as this, success is not measured by completion of specific objectives but rather how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship,” &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/index.html"&gt;the company wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk-RFQJKPR5MgSdcUZJ150aT8RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158572/starship_10.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StPAs4"&gt;SpaceX has been cranking out Starship prototypes over the last few years at the company’s test facility in Boca Chica, performing incremental tests and flights on the vehicles in preparation for sending one to orbit. The one that flew today is the eighth major prototype the company has crafted. SpaceX has flown a few Starship prototypes before, but only to just under 500 feet, or 150 meters, in the air. Those prototypes were also smaller in size than the final Starship design, and didn’t sport the nosecone at the top of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zsl7D4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1331388984023461888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 25, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kPuDy6"&gt;The prototype that flew today bore a much stronger resemblance to the finalized Starship, including the nosecone, as well as flaps on the side of the vehicle meant to help with steering during landing. The vehicle was also equipped with three Raptors, giant engines that SpaceX has developed just for Starship. The final Starship will supposedly be equipped with six main Raptor engines — three optimized to be used at sea level and three optimized for use in the vacuum of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m6XTVNRip7mTj-5gPDCUrk9XCiQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158548/starship2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TRVzCv"&gt;SpaceX already has two other prototypes built, similar in size and shape to today’s prototype — dubbed SN9 and SN10. It’s possible those vehicles will see some upcoming flights, as well, especially now that the eighth prototype is no longer in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLUfCd"&gt;SpaceX has a lot riding on these tests, as the company hopes to use Starship to fulfill Musk’s ambitions of starting a settlement on Mars. NASA is also considering using Starship as a lunar lander for its Artemis program. It’s possible NASA astronauts could take SpaceX’s Starship down to the surface of the Moon as a part of the agency’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BaY05x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ap-BkkrRg-o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVNeIc"&gt;Meanwhile, SpaceX has started construction on another important piece of the Starship system: the Super Heavy booster that will loft Starship into orbit. It’s unclear when the vehicle will take its first flight. In September of 2019, Musk predicted that SpaceX would send a Starship into orbit within six months. More than a year later, the timeline for the first orbital flight is murky — but today’s flight puts SpaceX closer to that important launch&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A secretive treasure hunter is unmasked by a court case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7m_a5O9X__j1LeYkxOF1Gg5VbLY=/0x63:479x382/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487620/fenn002_enl_2fbdab7583766a0b345136cc8b5528ba8302dd79_s1400.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of the chest hidden by Forrest Fenn. | Photo: Forrest Fenn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0i0YTO"&gt;Finding a long-hidden treasure in the woods of Wyoming seems like a tall tale that would be told around a campfire, but it happens to be reality for Jack Stuef. As with many treasure hunting stories, though, the intrigue isn’t over just because the prize has been found. Stuef had been trying to stay anonymous and had done so until this week, but now he says he’s been forced to reveal his identity &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-treasure-chest-rocky-mountains-forrest-fenn-20200608-xltbeao5zvbkjiby732x73fhxe-story.html"&gt;after a lawsuit was filed&lt;/a&gt; alleging that he obtained the treasure through hacking and stalking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfKhyu"&gt;The chest in question, &lt;a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/forrest-fenn-confirms-his-treasure-has-been-found/article_37006cfe-a8d7-11ea-8653-873ca96e31ef.html"&gt;filled with 22 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of treasure-y things like gold coins and jewelry, was hidden by Forrest Fenn, a Santa Fe art dealer, and has been the object of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/forrest-fenn-treasure-chest-pictures-trnd/index.html"&gt;widely publicized hunt&lt;/a&gt; that’s been going on since 2010. Stuef’s desire for his identity to remain hidden is understandable, as some treasure hunters have gone as far as to &lt;a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1233629/pennsylvania-man-arrested-at-forrest-fenns-house.html"&gt;break into Fenn’s house&lt;/a&gt; and file lawsuits against him after he announced the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUziT3"&gt;Stuef now has to deal with a lawsuit of his own, which was filed against him (as “Unknown Defendant”) and Fenn by Barbara Anderson, another treasure hunter who says she’s spent a considerable amount of time and money on the search. She filed it in an attempt to find the identity of the finder and alleges that the treasure’s finder followed her and hacked into her computer and email to steal the information and clues she had gathered. Anderson had been searching in and around Santa Fe, though the treasure ended up &lt;a href="https://dalneitzel.com/2020/08/27/18/"&gt;being found in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;. She claims that she had found the final clue that led to the treasure’s actual location but that Stuef followed her to it and was able to beat her to the treasure’s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIvSeI"&gt;Stuef denies that any of this happened, but he says developments in the case will soon lead to his identity becoming a matter of public record, so he wanted to beat it to the punch and reveal himself on his own terms. “The U.S. District Court for New Mexico has ruled that Forrest’s estate must provide some of my personal information to a woman I do not know and with whom I have never communicated,” he says &lt;a href="https://thefinder.medium.com/a-statement-on-the-disclosure-of-my-identity-602d95f04b9f"&gt;in his Medium post revealing his identity&lt;/a&gt;, before calling the lawsuit “meritless.” He says that he “found the treasure as [Fenn] designed it to be found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1tiAr"&gt;Alongside the Medium post, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2419429/forrest-fenn-treasure-jack-stuef"&gt;a story in &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that has more details about Stuef’s two-year search — except for the one many treasure hunters were hoping to learn: where he found it. Stuef says that he’s keeping that secret to honor what he believes would’ve been Fenn’s wishes. (Fenn &lt;a href="https://thefinder.medium.com/a-remembrance-of-forrest-fenn-1be2a8646ff2"&gt;died in September&lt;/a&gt;.) He doesn’t want the location to “become a tourist attraction” for treasure hunters. For now, he still has the treasure chest hidden away in a vault somewhere (as all treasures should be), but he hopes to sell it to someone who will let other treasure hunters see it (though exactly where that is, he’s keeping a secret for now). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical to become an actual one-night Broadway-style show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pavg5LXanwee5B9zvJ97iRNlwHQ=/44x0:607x375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487423/Seaview_Work_Featured_Images_Ratatouille_650x375.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d3pgHB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/ratatouille-musical-tiktok.html"&gt;TikTok’s fan-made crowdsourced &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; is making the jump from social media to the stage. &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille: The TikTok Musical&lt;/em&gt; is going to debut as an actual show for a one-night-only concert on January 1st, which will benefit The Actors Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmByGX"&gt;The streamed show will be produced by &lt;a href="https://seaviewprods.com/work/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical/"&gt;Seaview Productions&lt;/a&gt; (best known for producing &lt;em&gt;Slave Play&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/theater/tony-award-nominations.html"&gt;most Tony Award-nominated show&lt;/a&gt; in Broadway history) and is being presented “in association with TikTok.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMKWIG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-oral-history-1091547/"&gt;so-called &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical&lt;/a&gt; — based on the 2007 Disney / Pixar film — has been percolating over the past several months on TikTok. What started as a one-off bit has slowly snowballed into a massive undertaking, with bored Broadway fans, composers, set designers, costume makers, choreographers, and more working together to build bits and pieces of the (until now) fictional show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KluXDL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678" data-video-id="6885475193410620678" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@danieljmertzlufft" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft"&gt;@danieljmertzlufft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remy: The Musical OG Song @e_jaccs add.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4jUXiA"&gt;There aren’t many details yet on what the actual show will look like, although the musical promises to “celebrate the delectable crowd-sourced creation by giving it the full high-kicking, lip-smacking Broadway treatment.” Just what that means in terms of the scope of the show is, as of yet, unclear. The cast and creative team have similarly not yet been announced, although some of “Broadway’s biggest and brightest talents” are apparently involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hafpIQ"&gt;Many of the viral TikTok stars that have helped contribute to the crowdsourced show in the past few months are involved in the production, too. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blakeyrouse?lang=en"&gt;Blake Rouse&lt;/a&gt; (the composer behind two of the more popular songs on TikTok, “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjU_p3uvlkU"&gt;The Rat’s Way of Life&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvI0Lg8JmPQ"&gt;Ratatouille Tango&lt;/a&gt;”) tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his songs will be featured in the show. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tinymallet/status/1327652187980312579"&gt;Jess Siswick&lt;/a&gt; — another TikTok creator — is having her &lt;a href="https://www.playbill.com/article/presenting-the-official-fake-ratatouille-playbill"&gt;mocked-up Playbill program&lt;/a&gt; for the show appear as the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaytix.com%2Fx%2Fnyc%2Fshows%2F22803-Ratatouille--The-TikTok-Musical&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22166215%2Fratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;actual promotional artwork&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGdFSw"&gt;Two of the &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; musical’s original creators also appear to be involved, or at least approve of the project: both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344"&gt;Emily Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;@e_jaccs&lt;/a&gt;), who wrote the original “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@e_jaccs/video/6859521038418447622?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6859521038418447622"&gt;Remy the Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt;” song for TikTok, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljmertz/status/1336765015911768069"&gt;composer Daniel Mertzlufft&lt;/a&gt;, whose viral &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6885475193410620678"&gt;theatrical arrangement of that song&lt;/a&gt; helped kickstart the &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/em&gt; frenzy, have both tweeted about the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bGlIPL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SOOOO wild! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ratatouillemusical?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ratatouillemusical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratatousical?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ratatousical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/xgGdUSU5nB"&gt;https://t.co/xgGdUSU5nB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emily Jacobsen (@anEmilyJacobsen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uWJphu"&gt;Most importantly, though, the project appears to have Disney’s blessing: “Although we do not have development plans for the title, we love when our fans engage with Disney stories. We applaud and thank all of the online theatre makers for helping to benefit The Actors Fund in this unprecedented time of need,” notes a Disney statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0tckV"&gt;The show will stream through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todaytix.com%2Fx%2Fnyc%2Fshows%2F22803-Ratatouille--The-TikTok-Musical&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22166215%2Fratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TodayTix&lt;/a&gt; on January 1st at 7PM ET, with tickets ranging from $5 to $50 (depending on the desired donation); following the premiere, the show will be available to watch on demand for 72 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic turned the volume down on ocean noise pollution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Humpback Whale, Mother and Calf, Megaptera novaeangliae, Socorro, Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZRynkAygy9J6YN0Mb7QvWM_V-T4=/0x0:5315x3543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487402/550595891.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tnNvUL"&gt;The economic fallout from COVID-19 has temporarily muted some of the noise coming from maritime traffic. That’s given scientists a rare opportunity to study what happens to marine life when humans quiet down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxZpZU"&gt;Humans today pollute oceans with whirring ship propellers and booming air guns searching for oil and gas deposits. Seeing whales and other creatures’ behavior now that the pandemic has quieted things down is like a peek into what marine life was like before humans drastically turned up the volume over the past 200 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kRh3wP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Once in a lifetime opportunity to study whale communication in natural quiet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfPG9I"&gt;“It’s like this horrible pandemic confined us humans into really small spaces but gave the whales back a lot of room to grow, both physically and acoustically,” Christine Gabriele, a wildlife biologist at Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, said in a press briefing. “I’m lucky actually to take this once in a lifetime opportunity to study whale communication in natural quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Soiwsr"&gt;Without the presence of cruise ships and tour boats that bring hundreds of thousands of visitors to Glacier Bay, Alaska, each year, humpback whales had a chance to take up more space and relax. Researchers observed them socializing and even taking naps out in the middle of channels that typically would have been loud and busy with vessels. Median daily sound levels in the bay in 2020 were 50 percent quieter than they were at the same time last year, according to Gabriele. It was so quiet, Gabriele was able to &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/nature/soundclips.htm"&gt;listen in&lt;/a&gt; on what she believed was a long exchange between a mother and calf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWWa3J"&gt;Gabriele and other researchers are tuning into a network of hydrophones, which are basically underwater microphones, to document these changes. She was one of several scientists with the National Park Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Texas A&amp;amp;M University at Galveston who shared preliminary findings from their research today. They held a briefing on ocean noise during the annual American Geophysical Union Fall meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrl4dU"&gt;Along the coastlines of the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, ocean noise levels dropped by about 30 percent this spring, thanks to fewer vessels. Human-created noise off the shorelines of California and Massachusetts also decreased, researchers said during the briefing. They’re still conducting their studies and have yet to publish much of their work. They plan to collaborate with scientists from other regions of the world to get a better global picture of the pandemic’s effects on ocean soundscapes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Gwiwy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Research can inform policies and technological advances&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PuMafw"&gt;The researchers will also continue watching humpback whales closely. They’ll take biopsy samples from the whales to see if there are any differences in their stress hormones this year and next year. And they’re listening in on how the whales’ communication might change. They’re curious about whether whales’ vocalizations get more complex when they can hear each other better and vice versa. Studies in the past have found that whales raise their voices as ambient noise increases — just like humans might in a noisy environment — which doesn’t usually make for drawn-out exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgS2X5"&gt;There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/science/oceans-whales-noise-offshore-drilling.html"&gt;other ways&lt;/a&gt; that diverse sea life depends on sound to navigate their worlds, find food, and avoid becoming food for something else. Scientists are scrambling to make the most out of this quiet reprieve to better understand all that. The hope is that some of this research can inform policies and technological advances that might be able to keep the ocean clamor down to bearable levels in the future, even as economic activity picks back up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2klJc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYxnNa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At his last Space Council meeting, Mike Pence announces new cadre of lunar astronauts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5mza40o0O3iXglhta8Wv9ezXtI=/135x0:1494x906/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487186/Screen_Shot_2020_12_09_at_2.48.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EydK9M"&gt;On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence hosted his last meeting of the National Space Council in Florida, using the opportunity to announce a list of NASA astronauts who will be considered for future missions to the Moon as part of NASA’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIRPPY"&gt;This cadre of astronauts — &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-team/"&gt;dubbed the Artemis Team&lt;/a&gt; — includes 18 astronauts, some with past flight experience and some who have yet to fly to space. The list includes some notable names, such as Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, the two women who made history by performing the first all-women spacewalk. Two of the astronauts, Victor Glover and Kate Rubins, are currently living on board the International Space Station. Five of the 18 made an appearance at the National Space Council meeting today at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida: Meir, Jessica Watkins, Anne McClain, Matthew Dominick, and Joe Acaba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArWqn6"&gt;With no flight assignments made yet, it’s unclear which of the nine women in the group will be the first chosen to fly to the Moon — a goal that NASA has been touting since the creation of the Artemis program. And it’s possible that this group will change, according to NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. “This is the first cadre of our Artemis astronauts,” he said at the meeting. “I want to be clear, there’s going to be more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LGlhe6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s unclear which of the nine women in the group will be the first chosen to fly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NNsXoE"&gt;The meeting didn’t just focus on the astronauts. Pence also announced that President Trump released a new National Space Policy, a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National-Space-Policy.pdf"&gt;32-page document&lt;/a&gt; laying out the president’s space vision for the executive branch. “It emphasizes that space is critical to our security and our way of life, and lays out the fundamental principles to put America first in space,” Pence said of the policy. The previous National Space Policy was issued in June 2010 under the Obama administration. Pence also announced today that the administration would be renaming two Air Force bases — the Patrick Air Force Base and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station — to Space Force bases. Another base will also be named after the pioneering aviator Chuck Yeager, who died at the age of 97 on December 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="do7fxm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG2JwwOphLQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6xCjb1"&gt;The astronaut announcement, in particular, is an interesting statement to make as the country prepares for a new administration. In the past, transitions have resulted in abrupt changes to space policy. Under the Obama administration, NASA had been focused on putting people on Mars, but in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16761862/nasa-moon-mission-mars-donald-trump"&gt;President Trump signed a space policy directive&lt;/a&gt; tasking NASA with returning people to the Moon. Ever since then, NASA has been hard at work crafting a program to get astronauts to the lunar surface, using a mixture of hardware that’s long been in development as well as spacecraft that still needs to be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oag1H"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282598/nasa-mike-pence-vice-president-space-policy-lunar-landings-2024-gateway-sls-orion"&gt;Pence famously challenged NASA&lt;/a&gt; with achieving its first lunar landing under the Artemis program by 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/18629403/nasa-artemis-moon-program-funds-hardware-apollo-11-anniversary"&gt;an incredibly ambitious deadline&lt;/a&gt; that would be difficult to meet. Bridenstine has worked hard to secure extra funding, lobbying Congress to spend an extra $3.4 billion next year to help fund lunar landers that will take humans to the surface of the Moon. So far, lawmakers have drafted legislation that would partially fund these landers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558572/nasa-senate-appropriations-artemis-program-moon-landers"&gt;but they seem reluctant to provide the full amount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NGVMjH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An interesting statement to make as the country prepares for a new administration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TkVvhR"&gt;With President-elect Joe Biden set to take office in January, the future of the Artemis program is even more uncertain. No officials associated with the incoming Biden administration have provided any hints of what the new president’s space agenda will look like, especially in regards to the human exploration program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCIUF1"&gt;But for now, NASA is still working toward its Moon goal. The Space Launch System — the giant rocket that the space agency plans to use to send people to the Moon — is about to undergo a key test in Mississippi ahead of its first uncrewed flight, scheduled for late 2021. Early next year, NASA also plans to select two companies to move forward with creating new lunar landers. And now, NASA has a distinct group of astronauts it can pick from when it’s time to actually fly people to the Moon again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k65vxB"&gt;With all of these pieces in place, it may make it more difficult for the new administration to cancel the Artemis program. But it’s possible that some significant changes are still in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58grB4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fwam7K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing’s 737 Max is back in service</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DPYGdc"&gt;Boeing’s troubled 737 Max made its first commercial flight since March 2019 today, marking the end of a 20-month grounding following two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. Brazil’s Gol Airlines was the first in the world to put paying customers on the plane again since the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573113/boeing-737-max-cleared-fly-grounding-faa-crashes"&gt;approved its return to flight in November&lt;/a&gt;. A 737 Max 8 ferried passengers from Sao Paulo to Porto Alegre, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-737-max-back-in-air-2-years-after-grounded-by-crashes/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9I7rRc"&gt;Gol Airlines told the publication it plans to use the 737 Max in regular service starting later this month, and passengers who don’t want to fly on the plane will be able to exchange their tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLrAbJ"&gt;Other airlines are getting ready to bring the plane back into their fleets, too. American Airlines &lt;a href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/Return-of-the-Boeing-737-MAX-to-service-OPS-DIS-11/default.aspx"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; it plans to reintroduce the 737 Max to its fleets by first flying without passengers and then slowly restoring commercial service starting at the end of the year. Southwest Airlines, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20927213/boeing-737-max-southwest-planes-crash-budget-airlines-grounded-cost-maintenance"&gt;made the biggest bet on the 737 Max&lt;/a&gt; when it was introduced a few years ago, says it will restart commercial flights &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.southwest.com%2F737-max%2F%23return-to-service-plan&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22165956%2Fboeing-737-max-flight-brazil-gol-airlines#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no sooner than the second quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuMCKq"&gt;One thing holding up a wholesale return to the skies for the 737 Max is airlines must put pilots through new &lt;a href="https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/safety-ops-regulation/how-much-time-will-new-boeing-737-max-pilot-training-take"&gt;FAA-approved training specific to the problem that doomed the flights in 2018 and 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Planes that were in storage also need to be “&lt;a href="https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/how-long-will-flight-crew-training-take-boeing-737-maxs-return"&gt;depreserved&lt;/a&gt;,” or brought back into flying shape, and &lt;a href="https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/how-long-will-flight-crew-training-take-boeing-737-maxs-return"&gt;updated with new wiring and software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnjCVX"&gt;The two deadly crashes in late 2018 and early 2019 were caused in part because Boeing originally obscured the need for training on a tricky new piece of the 737 Max’s software. While trying to keep pace with rival Airbus’ fuel-efficient A320neo aircraft, Boeing had redesigned the prior 737 to use bigger, more economical engines. But the placement of those engines could cause a stall in certain takeoff situations. So Boeing developed software known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which counteracted the stall by automatically pushing the plane’s nose down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sx8VGP"&gt;In an effort to save time and money, though, the company didn’t tell the FAA or customers about MCAS. That meant the pilots of the two fatal crashes were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18518176/boeing-737-max-crash-problems-human-error-mcas-faa"&gt;fighting a system they didn’t even know existed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe just released the last Flash update ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Adobe Flash Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bHLBA_dPBaAcuHeGoZ0f7QnExOw=/0x23:600x423/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487031/adobe-flash-logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rEA041"&gt;Adobe has released the final scheduled update to its Flash Player plugin, weeks before Flash’s official retirement. As noted &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_32_air_32_release_notes.html"&gt;on Adobe’s site&lt;/a&gt;, yesterday marked the last update for Flash outside mainland China, which has a separate version of the software. Adobe will stop supporting Flash on December 31st, 2020, and it will block Flash content from running on January 12th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ietqEh"&gt;Adobe offered a brief farewell in its release notes. “We want to take a moment to thank all of our customers and developers who have used and created amazing Flash Player content over the last two decades,” the note says. “We are proud that Flash had a crucial role in evolving web content across animation, interactivity, audio, and video. We are excited to help lead the next era of digital experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Arpp2a"&gt;Flash has been on the chopping block since 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/25/16026236/adobe-flash-end-of-support-2020"&gt;when Adobe announced&lt;/a&gt; it would finally end support. Flash was already being phased out in major web browsers, and Adobe had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/1/9827778/stop-using-flash"&gt;urged developers&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 to switch to newer standards like HTML5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v60Kxh"&gt;There were good reasons to disable Flash, including frequent and numerous security holes. But it threatened the survival of countless old games and animations — a problem for web preservationists and anyone who fondly remembers platforms like Newgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b5bV9"&gt;Fortunately, we’ve seen numerous efforts to keep Flash media alive. An open-source emulator &lt;a href="https://ruffle.rs/#"&gt;called Ruffle&lt;/a&gt; will enable old Flash files through a desktop app or web browser. The Internet Archive is using Ruffle to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578616/internet-archive-preservation-flash-animations-games-adobe"&gt;preserve over 1,000 games and animations&lt;/a&gt; on its site. And Flash mega-portal Kongregate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311318/kongregate-stops-accepting-new-game-submissions-flash-discontinued-layoffs"&gt;partnered with a museum&lt;/a&gt; to preserve its library of projects. But Adobe is about to finally say goodbye for good.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Privacy group files complaint against five online test-proctoring services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BULGARIA-HEALTH-VIRUS-EDUCATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jDc4iFRX5-C5HCeIUarEdxOmL20=/4x0:4713x3139/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68487023/1229868184.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNOamV"&gt;The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/EPIC-complaint-in-re-online-test-proctoring-companies-12-09-20.pdf"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the DC Attorney General’s office against five online test-proctoring services: Respondus, ProctorU, Proctorio, Examity, and Honorlock. EPIC claims that the firms violate the privacy rights of students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5waCJ0"&gt;The five companies sell software designed to prevent cheating in online tests and exams. Some are designed to track applications that are running on test-takers’ computers or restrict access to certain programs during the testing period. Others track students’ activity during the test via their webcams and microphones and flag potentially suspicious behavior to their instructor, using either algorithms or live monitoring. In some cases, test-takers need to show a proctor their surroundings and verify their identity with personal information before the test can begin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnPNDO"&gt;These methods — the collection of personal information and the use of “secret algorithms” — amount to “unfair and deceptive trade practices,” EPIC argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNn1wT"&gt;“Respondents’ collection of sensitive personal information, including biometric data, is unjustified, excessive, and harmful to students who have no meaningful opportunity to opt out of such systems,” the complaint further reads. “Forcibly collecting personal information from test-takers, including sensitive biometric data, is inherently invasive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fzkf0p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Respondents’ collection of sensitive personal information, including biometric data, is unjustified, excessive, and harmful.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DFaegV"&gt;The use of remote test-proctoring services has skyrocketed with this year’s rise in online instruction at all grade levels. So, too, has scrutiny on its providers. Proctorio (one of EPIC’s targets, which over 400 universities use) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year for its suite of “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies,” which monitor the position of a student’s head while they take their test and flags possible signs of cheating. Critics called the service discriminatory, anxiety-provoking, and an invasion of privacy. Thousands of students have signed &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/amy-klobuchar-stop-the-use-of-online-proctoring-exams-at-the-university-of-minnesota?recruiter=1147745069&amp;amp;recruited_by_id=81b9d6d0-f2d4-11ea-8282-0d71d6651892&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard"&gt;petitions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ams.ubc.ca/news/open-letter-regarding-the-usage-of-proctorio/"&gt;open letters&lt;/a&gt; calling on their schools to get rid of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBQQmS"&gt;Examity, which provides live proctors who watch test-takers through their webcams, has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21232777/examity-remote-test-proctoring-online-class-education"&gt;unpopular on some campuses&lt;/a&gt;. “Every student I know finds this the creepiest thing ever,” one University of Arizona student said of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfcjcR"&gt;The attorney general will need to act on EPIC’s complaint for it to result in any charges. But the group has made clear that it’s not backing down. It’s also &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/index.html#legal"&gt;sent letters&lt;/a&gt; to all five companies warning them that it’s prepared to sue unless they agree to “limit their collection of personal data, comply with basic requirements for trustworthy AI, and submit to annual third-party audits.”&lt;/p&gt;
