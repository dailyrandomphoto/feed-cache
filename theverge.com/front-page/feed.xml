    <title>Bose headphones and Apple iPhone accessories are on sale today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bose QuietComfort 35" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFa9sV6MwJK-8ixh2-6yCYbBbYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994166/theverge10_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c8qrAq"&gt;There are many great deals to be had today, especially if you enjoy a variety of options to browse and online window-shop. Amazon’s highlighted daily sale, currently coined as Epic Daily Deals, has several Bose headphones and earbuds discounted. There is a little bit for everyone here, ranging from the popular mainstay QuietComfort 35 II Bluetooth headphones and its gaming-accessorized counterpart to noise-canceling and sport-focused earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vS7NSQ"&gt;First, let’s dive into the QC35 II. These noise-canceling headphones became the industry standard for folks wanting comfortable and lightweight everyday headphones, especially for commuting and traveling on planes where the ANC can be most effective. There is a new model that just came out, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;Bose QC45&lt;/a&gt;, so the QC35 II may be phased out at some point, but the time is ripe for discounts. Amazon’s daily deal price on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the QC35 II for today is $249&lt;/a&gt;, saving $50 off its usual $300 price and a full $80 cheaper than the brand new model that succeeds it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wVotej"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLKakm"&gt;If you want to keep using your commuter headphones once you’re home, you can also score the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DVCNYJC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QC35 II in its gaming-adorned load-out for just $279&lt;/a&gt; — that same $50 discount. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439699/bose-quiet-comfort-35-ii-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-pc-bluetooth-price"&gt;QuietComfort 35 II Gaming Headset is the same set of cans&lt;/a&gt; but with an attachable mic boom and USB controller for volume and monitoring adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tsOSMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFypL"&gt;If you’re not the full-size headphones type and prefer the convenience of earbuds or the flexibility of open-ear listening, there are even more options today. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sit at the top of these offerings, with active noise canceling that bests the AirPods Pro and takes the crown as the ANC champ. Just be aware that the bulky case makes these larger earbuds a bit less convenient to tote around. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Noise-Cancelling-Earbuds/dp/B08C4KWM9T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s sale price of $199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is the best price to date on these earbuds that launched at the tail end of 2020, with a significant savings of $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PoINHk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="G6U4Gf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HlVxM1"&gt;Capping off all these Bose sales at Amazon today, here is a lightning round of earbuds and open-ear options to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2DbRnW"&gt;The smaller, workout-focused Bose Sport Earbuds are IPX4 sweat and weather resistant and down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sport-Earbuds-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B08CJCTG6Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149 — a savings of $30&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zO6sdL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215281/base-sport-open-earbuds-ambient-noise-workout"&gt;Bose Sport Open Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; also offer the same environmental resistance without blocking your ear canal, keeping you aware of the general space around you. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sport-Open-Earbuds-Headphones/dp/B08VRLZGMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s price of $179 saves $20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5kT7IG"&gt;For a more stylish take on open-ear Bluetooth wireless listening, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Frames-Audio-Sunglasses-Black/dp/B07P7VVCDD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Frames Alto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Frames-Tempo-Sunglasses-Connectivity/dp/B08CZL53F3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Frames Tempo&lt;/a&gt; are discounted by $24 and $25, respectively. The Alto is the more fashion-focused everyday wear version, while the Tempo is better suited for an active lifestyle like cycling or running. Both keep your ears unblocked to keep you better in tune with your surroundings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="PNPQ7I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10806953"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="FFwYz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwy94m"&gt;Shifting from Bose deals to Apple accessories deals, AT&amp;amp;T’s online store is offering 15 percent discounts on myriad iPhone accessories. If you recently got a new iPhone, there might be an accessory for you here that is now on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axu7V5"&gt;Some notable highlights include the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/chargers/apple-20w-usb-c-power-adapter-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W USB-C fast charger&lt;/a&gt; for ensuring your iPhone gets topped up quicker, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/browse/all/apple_clear" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clear silicone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/browse/all/apple_works-with-magsafe_apple-new" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leather cases&lt;/a&gt; for protecting the full iPhone 13 range, the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/specialty-items/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-midnight.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe leather wallet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/batteries/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeals101421/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/chargers/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Duo wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="TuQhC6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ml9ge2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10807025"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ScA8vn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JhYr9f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5xgee1"&gt;OH, WE’RE NOT DONE HERE: A FEW MORE DEALS TO CHECK OUT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0pLaLU"&gt;Costco members can get what is effectively a &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/razer-homerun-gaming-bundle-keyboard-+-mouse-+-pad-+-headset.product.100742101.html"&gt;PC gamer’s peripheral starter pack from Razer for just $80&lt;/a&gt;. The hilariously named Razer Homerun Gaming Bundle includes a Razer Kraken V3 X Gaming Headset, DeathAdder V2 Gaming Mouse, Ornata V2 Gaming Keyboard, and Gigantus V2 Mouse Pad. That’s a lot of RGB for 80 bucks. Perfect for jumping all-in on Razer peripherals or for gifting to the mad gaming lad in your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kWiyGF"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are still available from &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F%3D%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkBX8bWR1ykOzY0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_10451%26clickid%3D0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkBX8bWR1ykOzY0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D567111%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals101421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $180&lt;/a&gt;. We might see new base model AirPods at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;upcoming Apple event&lt;/a&gt;, but the Pros will most likely stick around and only get cheaper around Black Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HcItNi"&gt;Adorama has &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fnl427003h7pa.html%3Fsdtid%3D15330853%26sterm%3DX6p2ms0xpxyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkBX8e1p1ykOzY0%26utm_source%3Drflaid62905&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals101421"&gt;$70 off the Nanoleaf Hexagon starter kit&lt;/a&gt;, which includes seven light panels and an accessory kit for $230. It is backordered, but you can still lock in the deal price, and your card will not be charged until it ships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The $499 HTC Vive Flow is VR for people who don’t like VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rlMtg6aNshLqJE1H4W9Rbo9axKs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994113/akrales_211005_4774_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;HTC wants to find a new VR market — but what is it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3k75EG"&gt;After years of focusing on business-oriented virtual reality, HTC is launching a $499 entertainment-focused headset called the Vive Flow in November, with preorders starting globally today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px43Xw"&gt;The new Vive Flow looks radically different from most HTC Vive devices. It’s a standalone piece of hardware modeled after a pair of sunglasses, and at first glance it could pass for an &lt;em&gt;augmented&lt;/em&gt; reality headset, not just a VR one. But behind those slightly bug-eyed mirror shades, you’ll find a lighter version of earlier Vive headsets — minus some major features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssvVAYZB2p5r_er-wSMldIKiKZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908700/akrales_211005_4774_0376.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vive Flow features focus dials on the inside of the headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Pe4G"&gt;The Vive Flow, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721337/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-vivport-verse-metaverse"&gt;leaked heavily&lt;/a&gt; before HTC’s reveal today, is a compromise between capability and approachability. The device has a 1.6K-per-eye display (HTC didn’t provide the exact resolution) with a 100-degree field of view at a 75Hz refresh rate. That’s a little more limited than the 120 degrees and 90Hz rate that you’ll find on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588917/htc-vive-focus-3-vr-headset-review"&gt;the more costly Vive Focus 3&lt;/a&gt; and roughly the same refresh rate but a lower field of view than the original Quest. It’s also slightly comparable to the Oculus Quest’s refresh rate before a recent upgrade and a little more cramped than its 110-degree field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S33DQB"&gt;Two front-facing cameras handle inside-out motion tracking, and HTC plans to support hand tracking as well, although the feature wasn’t available during a pre-launch demo and didn’t give an exact timeline for its rollout. It’s using the last-generation Qualcomm XR1 chipset (as opposed to the Quest 2’s XR2), and it’s got a respectable 64GB of storage space but — unlike the Focus 3 — no slot for an expansion card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpr4Du"&gt;Lightweight hardware is a big selling point for HTC. “We wanted to get to something lighter, more wearable, easier to travel with,” says Dan O’Brien, HTC’s head of VR. The Flow weighs 189 grams, compared to around 500 grams for the Oculus Quest 2, and has a hinged design that folds up to fit in a $49 carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6YmYLkj-8Iq2cieaGsGcbZn5uU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908694/akrales_211005_4774_0177.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lzT2mc"&gt;Unlike earlier Vive headsets, the Vive Flow won’t come with a controller. Instead, you connect the headset wirelessly to an Android smartphone and use the phone as a combination remote / touchpad. Similar to the mobile Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR remotes, it’s basically a virtual laser pointer with buttons for selecting items and calling up the homescreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vGX0j"&gt;Leaked photos showed the Flow plugged into a black box, which some people speculated might be an external computing device. It’s actually a $79 battery pack that should let you use the headset for four to five hours. The Flow technically has its own battery, but HTC says it only lasts a few minutes — it’s designed to let you swap power sources without turning off the headset. So you’ll need either the HTC battery, which is sold separately from the headset, or (according to HTC) any 10,000mAh power bank and a USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5McNzYw9hbRfK9ATk-Q5NJaITU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908698/akrales_211005_4774_0416.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxbJ23"&gt;In addition to controlling the device, the phone connection lets you mirror Android apps, calling up a virtual copy of your phone’s homescreen and letting you launch apps like streaming video services in a floating window. The headset doesn’t pair with iPhones, and while HTC hasn’t ruled out future support, it indicated there were serious barriers to making iOS play well with the Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SMTg7"&gt;HTC wants people to use the Vive Flow for visually immersive but mostly stationary experiences. So you can watch a 360-degree video or sit in a virtual environment, but you can’t use apps that require full-fledged virtual hands. (This rules out most well-known VR games.) The camera tracking gives you a more natural experience than a headset that can only detect the angle of your head, but the app catalog and the somewhat loose-fitting glasses-style design mean you probably won’t be walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7sC8p"&gt;HTC says the Flow will launch with 100 apps and support 150 by the end of the year. In addition to uses like streaming video, its release announcement promotes the Tripp meditation app and the VR therapeutic service MyndVR, which is tailored for older adults. You can also engage with VR social spaces like Vive Sync and watch streaming video, something that’s proven &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22700782/nreal-air-smart-ar-glasses-release-date-shipping-countries"&gt;popular on AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;. The Flow will support a limited subset of the apps on HTC’s Viveport store, and users can subscribe to a discounted, Flow-focused $5.99-per-month version of Viveport’s app subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow with carrying case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_vBv4ACPINAIXdOSQGO4fwZY4JI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926215/Vive_Flow_Lifestyle_Image_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HTC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow with phone controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8aG6A08VbpHcsXw6EWnvFII5XrE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926216/Vive_Flow_Lifestyle_Image_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HTC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGz8Ry"&gt;The Vive Flow seems basically pitched as a VR headset for people who find current VR headsets overcomplicated or intimidating. O’Brien describes the device as something that’s easy to put in a bag while traveling without worrying about extra pieces like controllers. “We wanted to make something that was super easy and flexible,” he says. Instead of directly competing with gaming-oriented headsets, HTC is trying to carve out a new category of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVU23f"&gt;HTC’s focus on older users (“the huge Boomer population,” as a MyndVR representative put it) is part of this strategy. So is the push for a glasses-like design instead of the straps you’ll find on most headsets. “There’s the user that really just wants this thing to be un-intimidating and easy to pop on and off,” O’Brien says — and that’s who the Flow is made for. The result has a lot in common with the now-discontinued Oculus Go, but with a svelter look and upgrades like the inside-out camera tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wlTPTDFi72KIwoa_nAtqX23_sRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908697/akrales_211005_4774_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a1SZAuNt51nupsEA-v40rkX1wWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908695/akrales_211005_4774_0043.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIh0gg"&gt;My brief experience with the Vive Flow was a mixed bag. The Flow is, in fact, remarkably light — presumably in part because HTC offloaded its battery. But without a strap system to keep the headset in place, the screen kept slipping down my face and blurring the top half of my VR experience. HTC plans to offer alternate swappable face gaskets for different fits, and one of them worked better than the original. But I still had to be careful while turning my head, and the feeling of carefully balancing the headset wasn’t exactly relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbPJBe"&gt;The Flow was exponentially more bearable than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/10/12405354/dlodlo-v1-virtual-reality-headset-sunglasses"&gt;earlier “glasses-style” VR headsets&lt;/a&gt; I’ve tried. It’s just still a lot more unsteady-feeling than the Focus 3, Quest, or practically any other major headset, and there’s no alternate strap option for people who want a more secure fit. There’s a diopter adjustment dial so you can change the focus on each eye individually, but like the Quest 2, you inconveniently can’t change the focus while you’re actually looking at an image — you have to take the headset off, twist the wheels a notch, and then put it back on again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L99GL"&gt;The smartphone-based controller, the Vive Flow’s biggest departure from standard VR design, is theoretically reasonable but practically awkward. I used an HTC-provided Android device that worked fine as a VR laser pointer. But thanks to the long-running trend of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus"&gt;ever-bigger phones&lt;/a&gt;, I could barely fit my hand around HTC’s phone to tap virtual buttons on the screen. It’s also a strange choice for any headset aimed at older users, who are &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/"&gt;dramatically less likely&lt;/a&gt; to own smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJlOfH0HqmI8pXjaQDT6Jw2Ml6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908699/akrales_211005_4774_0296.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A soft, swappable gasket sits between your face and the lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IgtrFT"&gt;Hand tracking could partly solve the interaction issue. But gesture interfaces remain frustratingly hit-or-miss and typically require holding your fingers up to perform fine motions, which also seems like a bad option if your hands have limited mobility, and I didn’t get to try HTC’s version in my demo. O’Brien says HTC is still toying with options for other control systems — its plan is to release the headset and then tweak its design based on how people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LVAy8"&gt;More generally, it’s not clear HTC’s emphasis on portability is the key to winning over VR doubters. Companies have been pitching “VR you can throw in your bag” for years now, and outside of people whose jobs involve headsets, I haven’t seen a single human being cite that as a selling point — while I’ve heard even skeptics praise bulkier headsets for being comfortable. HTC also says people will feel less awkward wearing this glasses-like design in public settings like airplanes. As someone who actually has worn a VR headset on an airplane, I’m not sure that’s enough to erase its fundamental weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EahLpo"&gt;There isn’t really a clear audience for the Flow in the US market. It’s far more expensive and less feature-rich than the Facebook-subsidized Oculus Quest 2 but without specialized features that might make it appealing for businesses or other organizations. (Film festivals and schools could use a no-frills VR headset for 360-degree video, for instance... but the Flow isn’t it.) HTC has designed social apps like Sync that could have relatively broad appeal. But outside its meditation and video options, my Flow demo didn’t offer a great sense of its day-to-day value. I found mostly small games that I might play occasionally, not tools I’d spend $499 to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5dpgpf"&gt;But HTC has built a strong base of VR business hardware, and for now, it seems content to release the Flow as an experiment. At the very least, you won’t find another major headset like it — even if it does make you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723442/htc-vive-pro-headset-leaked-photos-evan-blass-bug-look"&gt;sort of look like a bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is letting you register for the chance to buy a PS5 for the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5-VrHa1xQdbrNCg4eTa64audlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994014/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="46htYb"&gt;Sony has launched &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/register-to-buy/"&gt;a landing page where you can register for the opportunity to buy a PS5 later this year&lt;/a&gt;, in time for the holidays. The company says it will have “a limited amount of PS5 consoles” for US customers through its PlayStation store. It’s probably a good idea to fill out the registration sooner than later, and you’ll need a PlayStation Network ID to do so. Though, unlike its queueing system for distributing consoles, the selection process here doesn’t seem entirely like a first-come, first-served situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYeQzt"&gt;Sony will begin to send out invitations with instructions to purchase a PS5, along with a slate of accessories if you’d like, in November. And it says that recipients of invites will be “based on previous interests and PlayStation activities.” That’s vague, but perhaps it’ll reward longtime players, or those who have checked the right boxes for its marketing emails. If you get an invite, you’ll want to act quickly, as each will be open for a limited time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="260x6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not everyone will get an invite&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GyxNfy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403245/sony-playstation-5-preorders-invite-only-registration-dualsense-accessories"&gt;This isn’t the first time&lt;/a&gt; that Sony has accepted registrations for a chance to snag a PS5. But toward the middle and end of 2021, console restocks have been increasingly rare. As we approach the holidays, we anticipate that retailers like Amazon and Best Buy may lock further restocks behind their paid memberships (Prime and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17382014/best-buy-total-tech-support-geek-squad-subscription"&gt;Totaltech&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) to incentivize joining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j02t9V"&gt;On one hand, this is good, since it should keep bots at bay, as well as people who may just be focused on flipping consoles for a profit. So in other words, this planned console restock from Sony might be your best chance to secure a console without an extra membership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f21rPk"&gt;Make sure to check out the frequently asked questions section at the bottom of the registration page to make sure you know all the steps ahead of time, to make your checkout process as seamless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>They’re putting guns on robot dogs now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyTiPb8v78C03YvoJle7iZVvZWI=/0x0:1395x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994006/sword_spur_robot_dog_gun.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not clear if this gun-equipped quadrupedal robot is for sale, but it’s only a matter of time. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sword International&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIBQcz"&gt;Quadrupedal robots are one of the most interesting developments in robotics in recent years. They’re small, nimble, and able to traverse environments that frustrate wheeled machines. So, of course, it was only a matter of	 time until someone put a gun on one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdGR8m"&gt;The image above shows a quadrupedal robot — a Vision 60 unit built by US firm Ghost Robotics — that’s been equipped with a custom gun by small-arms specialists Sword International. It seems the gun itself (dubbed the SPUR or “special purpose unmanned rifle”) is designed to be fitted onto a variety of robotic platforms. It has a 30x optical zoom, thermal camera for targeting in the dark, and an effective range of 1,200 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKHLeV"&gt;What’s not clear is whether or not Sword International or Ghost Robotics are currently selling this combination of gun and robot. But if they’re not, it seems they will be soon. As the &lt;a href="https://sworddefense.com/spur/"&gt;marketing copy&lt;/a&gt; on Sword’s website boasts: “The SWORD Defense Systems SPUR is the future of unmanned weapon systems, and that future is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCFoXJsgjjBD_R-4cRsS2bJWDQU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926431/SPUR_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sword International&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The robot base is built by Ghost Robotics, and carries a specially-designed gun built by Sword International. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M79WdP"&gt;The machine was shown off for the first time at the Association of the United States Army’s 2021 annual conference earlier this week. The conferences bills itself as a “landpower exposition and professional development forum” held in Washington DC, October 11-13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oKbIfl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US military has started testing robot dogs on patrol duty&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="scj5Y9"&gt;Details about the partnership between Ghost and Sword are unclear, but Ghost’s quadrupedal robots are already being tested by the US military. Last year, the 325th Security Forces Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida became the first unit in the Department of Defense to &lt;a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2413766/computerized-canines-to-join-tyndall-afb/"&gt;use quadrupedal robots&lt;/a&gt; in regular operations. It uses them to patrol the base’s perimeter, navigating swampy areas that “aren’t desirable for human beings and vehicles,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/38000/here-is-what-the-air-forces-new-robot-dogs-are-actually-capable-of"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Ghost Robotics CEO Jiren Parikh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0AKsN"&gt;Although reconnaissance is one of the most obvious use-cases for robot dogs, manufacturers are slowly experimenting with other payloads. As well as providing remote video and mapping, the machines could be used as mobile cell towers, to defuse bombs, or to detect chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear matter (otherwise known as CBRN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9Xn3j"&gt;And, of course, they can become weapons themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9d7zcWUbrRdn9LSjdgkrJ_mp28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926436/ghostrobotics2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ghost Robotics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike the better-known Boston Dynamics, Ghost Robotics seems eager to find military customers for its quadrupedal machines. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3EvVs8"&gt;Boston Dynamics, the best-known manufacturer of quadrupedal robots and makers of Spot, has a strict policy agains weaponizing its machines. Other manufacturers, it seems, aren’t so picky. After all, plenty of companies already sell uncrewed gun platforms that use tank treads or wheels, so adding the same basic kit to legged machines isn’t much of a stretch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5ApTK"&gt;The bigger question is how these robots will be deployed in the future and what level of oversight will be required when they start firing lethal rounds at humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q49Sd"&gt;For a while now, experts have been warning about the slow rise in the use of “killer robots” (known as lethal autonomous weapon systems, or LAWS, in official jargon), and &lt;a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11150.pdf"&gt;official US policy&lt;/a&gt; does not prohibit their development or deployment. Many groups are campaigning for a &lt;a href="https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/"&gt;preemptive ban&lt;/a&gt; on such systems, but, in the meantime, it seems companies will continue to build what is possible. And that means putting guns on robot dogs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to ‘sunset’ LinkedIn for China, and replace it with an app lacking social media features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BSfsJLv50Sy3wR9nh6ZB1GCrDUQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993944/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UxOR3V"&gt;Microsoft announced this morning that it’s shutting down the localized version of LinkedIn for China that has been available there since 2014. The move comes after increasing claims from academics and reporters that they’ve received notifications stating their profiles on the service are blocked in China, as reported recently by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/academics-bristle-over-linkedin-blocking-their-profiles-in-china-11624366667"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCJ3PJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/october/14/china-sunset-of-localized-version-of-linkedin-and-launch-of-new-injobs-app"&gt;its blog post announcing the move&lt;/a&gt; and a plan to launch a new China-only standalone product called InJobs, Microsoft did not directly reference those reports. Instead, it says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="m0yicA"&gt;While we’ve found success in helping Chinese members find jobs and economic opportunity, we have not found that same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed. We’re also facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oHQjtb"&gt;Today, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-abandons-linkedin-in-china-citing-challenging-operating-environment-11634220026?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Chinese government instructed Microsoft to better regulate its content in March, with a 30-day deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HM17ah"&gt;Last year when the Trump administration tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356787/go-read-this-microsoft-chinese-tech-roots-tik-tok-acquisition-financial-times"&gt;arrange the acquisition of TikTok by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; (CEO Satya Nadella called it the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697565/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-tiktok-acquisition-drama-strangest-thing"&gt;strangest thing I’ve ever worked on&lt;/a&gt;”), the company’s “immense soft power” in the country was part of making that possible. Outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908713/github-ceo-china-transcript-leak-microsoft"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon’s review system, LinkedIn was the only other foreign-owned platform allowed to host user-generated content in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b0zM0b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"China is making the internet less free, and US tech companies are helping ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18053142/china-internet-privacy-censorship-apple-microsoft-google-democracy-report"},{"title":"Trump pushing Microsoft to buy TikTok was ‘strangest thing I’ve ever worked on,’ says Satya Nadella ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697565/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-tiktok-acquisition-drama-strangest-thing"},{"title":"Why Google might return to China, even if it means censorship ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17647716/google-return-to-china-censorship"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pWDdkM"&gt;Twitter and Facebook have been blocked in China since 2009, while Google &lt;a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; its search operations from mainland China to Hong Kong in 2010. Meanwhile, Microsoft has sanitized Chinese language search results on Bing and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14998644/microsoft-windows-10-china-custom-version"&gt;offered a customized version of Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;. However, as China’s government has broadened a crackdown on tech giants in a manner affecting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615392/china-lawsuit-wechat-tencent-youth-mode-tech"&gt;gaming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22562912/china-regulator-orders-didi-ride-hailing-app-removed"&gt;ride-sharing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;, and more, its requests apparently crossed Microsoft’s self-identified threshold to reevaluate its LinkedIn operations. Apple continues to operate in the country unconstrained.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC is building a new chip factory in Japan, but warns of ‘tight’ supply through 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) logo..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3N9OPsyay4ViA386TrLCLHd5fw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993592/1235442658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SSH6z"&gt;TSMC has announced plans to expand its chipmaking efforts with a new factory in Japan during its Q3 2021 earnings call, marking the latest expansion for what’s already the world’s largest chipmaker, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/taiwans-tsmc-posts-138-rise-q3-profit-global-chip-demand-surge-2021-10-14/?taid=616821a30fbc4500016a4c12&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the news comes as the company also cautions that supply will be “tight” for chips throughout 2022 as a result on the ongoing shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w99kqr"&gt;The new plant is planned to focus on producing chips with older technologies, instead of the bleeding-edge processors that TSMC is best known for providing to companies like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. That’s particularly important, given that it’s those older chips — like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;those found in cars for controlling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;the airbags and seatbelts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;or the power management chip in an iPhone&lt;/a&gt; — that are the ones having the biggest supply issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdutcX"&gt;But it’ll still be a while before the new fab comes online, with production not expected to start until “late 2024.” TSMC is also still finalizing plans for the new factory, with CEO C.C. Wei noting on the company’s earnings call that the new Japan fab still needs approval from TSMC’s board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHjFEX"&gt;TSMC had previously cautioned in April that shortages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;could last through 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Wei noted then: “In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers. At that time, we’ll start to see the supply chain tightness release a little bit.” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has also echoed concerns about 2022 supply, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57996908"&gt;telling the BBC in July&lt;/a&gt; that it would be “a year or two” before shortages end. And while AMD CEO Lisa Su was more optimistic when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;speaking at the 2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;, she too noted that supply for at least the first half of the year will be “likely tight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="S3x7Qt"&gt;And investing to expand its capacity to meet that skyrocketing demand — and help prevent future shortages — is a key priority for the TSMC.

    <title>TCL’s budget 20S and 20SE phones beat expectations</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Big phones with small price tags&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QTp9Ss"&gt;If the TCL 20S and 20SE phones were on &lt;em&gt;The Price Is Right&lt;/em&gt;, you would probably guess much higher prices than their retail ones. With the 20S retailing for $250 and the 20SE going for $190, these sub-$300 4G phones are the real deal. They check all the boxes for what you’d want in a smartphone: they have big and bright screens, large 5,000mAh batteries, 128GB of internal storage, and “good enough” cameras. You even get a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqCcrM"&gt;TCL certainly knows a thing or two about manufacturing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;budget 4K Smart TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493125/tcl-alto-soundbar-9-plus-8i-6-plus-3-bluetooth-airplay-google-assistant-dolby-atmos-surround-sound"&gt;affordable soundbars&lt;/a&gt;, and many other gadgets. Heck, it was already quietly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;producing phones for the likes of BlackBerry, Alcatel, and Palm&lt;/a&gt; before starting its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21049747/tcl-10-pro-10l-5g-phones-brand-folding-prototype-ces-2020"&gt;eponymous line in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s taking those skills building other accessibly priced gadgets to its phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da4rRU"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;the fancier TCL 20S Pro&lt;/a&gt;, neither the 20S nor the 20SE has the latest and greatest processor, nor do they support 5G networking — those aren’t unsurprising omissions at these price points. But given TCL’s history, it’s no wonder the real stars of the TCL 20S and 20SE are their brilliant displays — though they each use different panels. Both phones look and feel more luxurious than they are because of their solid build quality, as well as attention to the details users really actually care about: long-lasting battery life, strong performance, ample storage, as well as ingenious design. Who says good things can’t come in budget-friendly packages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="AjyYRY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wvub5R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8TsFX1"&gt;The $190 20SE has a 6.82-inch display, which, at 720 pixels wide, is too low-resolution for a screen this large (720 x 1640 pixels; aspect ratio 20.5:9). I tried watching the 4K Dune trailer on YouTube, and it looked too dim and fuzzy at 720p for me to enjoy the video. Nevertheless, this display offers vibrant colors even at 50 percent brightness, whether or not you turn on the NXTVISION display optimization software (I did not see much difference either way). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qu6nF"&gt;The higher-priced 20S has a brighter yet slightly smaller 6.67-inch screen, with a higher-resolution FHD+ LCD display than the 20SE (1080 x 2400 pixels with 20:9 aspect ratio). When I watched the same Dune trailer at 1080p on the 20S, I could actually see sharper lines and more details this time around. Both displays look bright enough outdoors that I can read text if I boost the screen to 100 percent brightness. I also appreciate how unobtrusive the pinhole front camera is on the 20S compared to the 20SE’s tear-drop design, the latter of which actually cuts into the top of the display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6H0ZSg1qQQL_QOlehzk-1_D9ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911279/gsin_190125_4797_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the TCL 20S and 20SE have relatively bright displays with vibrant colors, thanks to TCL’s television know-how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ORMeyW"&gt;Of the two models, the 20S is slightly more manageable to use. But it’s still a big enough phone that I need two hands to use it safely. It can be a bit of a reach for my fingers to navigate different parts of the screen and hold it in the same hand, so I need my other hand to balance the device. At 0.23 inches (5.84mm) taller and 0.25oz (7.1g) heavier, the 20SE is physically bigger than the 20S, but its technical components are not in the same weight class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhqb2d"&gt;With a price that is $60 less than the 20S, TCL had to find savings in the $190 20SE anywhere it could. For one thing, the 20SE uses the lower-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chipset, whose slower processing speed can’t make up ground with 4GB of RAM. The 20S, on the other hand, is powered by the faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and is also supported by 4GB of RAM. The difference between the two isn’t very noticeable in basic texting and social media doomscrolling, but I would occasionally have to open an app or webpage twice on the 20SE because it wouldn’t load the first time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y23HLKFT4D2eX5y-WPCxRJk6IUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911281/gsin_190125_4797_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20SE’s 13-megapixel front camera and tear-drop design cuts into its display, but you don’t notice it after awhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaAVol"&gt;To see what these devices are capable of, I played a couple rounds of Pokemon Unite to see how they’d fare. Both TCL phones took about as long to load the game, whereas the OnePlus 9 Pro (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip) loaded the same round in about half the time. Since the 20SE has a lesser quality display and processor, I was not surprised that my Pikachu moved with a bit of lag. It was only slightly more responsive on the 20S, however. The 20SE’s dual speakers are also louder and buzzier than the 20S speakers, which sounded quieter but produced a more nuanced sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTbqi4"&gt;Despite their differences, both devices offer plenty of internal storage at 128GB and give you the option to expand that storage via microSD. The 20S’ microSD slot accepts up to a 1TB card, while the 20SE only supports up to a 256GB card. Both phones run Android 11 out of the box, with a TCL skin called TCL UI. Since the 20S will get one major OS update (TCL won’t commit to the same for the 20SE) and both phones will get two years of security updates, you’ll have ample room to install these upgrades and stash your content for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTtJ7csyZMadmbrhuKLkxFMI55E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911285/gsin_190126_4797_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20S’ integrated fingerprint sensor in the power button was a delight to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbu5lC"&gt;The fingerprint sensors on the 20S and 20SE deserve a special mention as they’re quick to recognize my fingerprint and unlock the phones. I especially love the fingerprint sensor that is built into the 20S’ power button, located on the right side of the phone. With just one touch, you not only wake up your phone but also unlock it in an elegant and intuitive way. The 20SE has a more traditional round fingerprint sensor on the back of the device that works just as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Zl0Q"&gt;Facial recognition on the 20SE can be rather useless. It either doesn’t recognize my face or asks me to touch an icon on the lock screen so that I can unlock the phone with my face, which entirely defeats the purpose of using a hands-free method to unlock. (Thankfully, you can disable this “feature.”) Facial recognition simply worked more consistently on the 20S than on the 20SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvglcj"&gt;Both phones include a 3.5mm audio jack on top, volume rocker on the right side, non-customizable Google Assistant button on the left, plus a USB-C port and a pair of bottom-firing dual speakers. The 20S has an understated back that looks curved from various angles, but the layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ actually makes the back cover really fingerprint-resistant. The 20SE’s back cover is the complete opposite: it’s a fingerprint disaster zone, thanks to its shiny, nano-photoetched back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfWDPMO5nGAdmxi2MR5kDvnP_1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911288/gsin_190126_4797_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE include a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2FSO2"&gt;With a 5,000mAH battery inside both phones, it was a challenge to use up that much power on deadline without doing anything out of the ordinary. My normal phone diet includes: checking my two email accounts, texting on WhatsApp and Google Hangouts, tweeting on Twitter, visiting my usual slate of websites like Reddit, as well as listening to a podcast or two. Due to the pandemic, I was home during my testing but tried to use a mix of Wi-Fi and 4G service to mimic real-world use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40nTeP"&gt;I actually got results that are close to TCL’s claims. I used the 20S for about 31 hours on one charge (TCL suggested 36 hours on 3G/4G) and took around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device, which is hardly a “fast charge” as claimed by TCL’s product sheet. Similarly, the 20SE lasted around 32 hours on one charge, compared to TCL’s estimate of 31 hours of use on 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a33xGW"&gt;Don’t get too excited about the cameras on the 20S or the 20SE, though: they can take great snaps in natural light, but I wouldn’t hang these photos on my wall. Both phones have a quad-camera setup, but each model uses different sensors. While the 20S has a 64-megapixel main and a 15-megapixel front camera, and the 20SE has a 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel front camera, these numbers don’t really say anything about the quality of their photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZeUT9L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDsaah"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTOxVs"&gt;I snapped a bunch of wide-angle and main camera shots (of the same area) using both phones. The ones from the 20S look more balanced with plenty of details, compared to the ones from the 20SE, where the water fountain area looks more over-exposed, especially at 4x cropped zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVI7ry"&gt;There’s a noticeable difference in color between the photos captured with the main cameras and the ultrawide angle cameras on both phones (8-megapixel on the 20S; 5-megapixel on the 20SE). There is also a problem with the Super Macro mode on both phones’ 2-megapixel macro cameras. Photos of the fuchsia flower look pixelated and flat, while the colors from the indoor photos of the blue hydrangea look way over-saturated in the yellow channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5newt"&gt;Based on the price point of these phones, I was surprised when any of the night shots came out somewhat presentable (I know they’re in varying degrees of blurriness). To be fair, even the photos from my Pixel 5 weren’t perfect. Both the 20S and 20SE struggled to focus with so many different light sources in the dark, and each photo required many awkward seconds to process. The 20S produced the sharper photo, while the 20SE’s photos look much less detailed, especially if you look at the lights from the office towers in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nn5y2T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fTXeF"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20SE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDTYKb"&gt;At first glance, both front-facing cameras captured decent selfies. But I have to give the edge to the 20S’ 16-megapixel camera for the more realistic colors and brighter photos. The selfie from the 20SE’s 13-megapixel front cam just looked more over-exposed: my sunglasses looked frosted, and my skin looked unnaturally pale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzmjQQKUh-mGOy2MMqKXfwEeRWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911280/gsin_190125_4797_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE feel solid in-hand, with nice details like nano-photoetching and fingerprint-resistant crystal coating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TNF7iu"&gt;I can’t really think of a higher quality budget phone in the $250 range that can beat the TCL 20S. It’s got all the hallmarks of a more expensive device but with a more affordable price tag. Its vibrant 6.67-inch 1080p display doesn’t look out of place next to other flagship phones, and it feels luxurious with that fingerprint-proofed layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z0mh1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better phone for $250 than the 20S&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvGFC9"&gt;Sure, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;$250 Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt; has an equally large battery and a slightly newer processor. In exchange, you get a meager 64GB of internal storage, which is a far cry from the 128GB plus microSD card slot that is offered by the 20S. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$269 OnePlus Nord 10&lt;/a&gt; (global GSM unlocked version) is also an option. It uses a newer Snapdragon chip that is 5G-compatible but still runs Android 10 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; is ready to drop. If you don’t care about having a 5G-ready phone right now, then the TCL 20S makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gQL3S"&gt;If you’re looking for an unlocked phone that is compatible with Verizon and most 4G GSM networks like AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, I don’t think you can go wrong with this unlocked TCL 20S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Us9CdG"&gt;If your budget is strictly sub-$200 and won’t be using Verizon as your carrier, then TCL 20SE is a smart choice. While the $180 OnePlus Nord N100 might save you $10, you’ll lose half the amount of internal storage for minimal savings (from 128GB on the TCL 20SE to 64GB on the N100) — that’s a terrible trade-off. You’ll be happier with a big bright screen, ample storage and battery life, as well as the ability to choose any GSM network (including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). If you don’t mind spending an extra $60, though, the 20S is worth the upgrade — your future self will thank you.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s latest Sonos lamp speaker is still an acquired taste</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Better looks, easier bulbs, still niche&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TNsk1S"&gt;The first table &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;lamp speaker from Ikea and Sonos&lt;/a&gt; was a little… strange. With its bulbous, mushroom-esque lampshade, fabric-covered speaker, and a plate beneath it all, the original Symfonisk lamp wasn’t exactly a universal fit for home decor. But the concept of a lamp that also doubles as a capable speaker was in itself a good idea — so the companies are back with their second try at it. The new Symfonisk has a more traditional design, fixes the original’s frustratingly limited bulb compatibility, and has a revamped speaker architecture that does a better job spreading sound throughout a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTlzgT"&gt;Ikea is now selling the base/speaker and lampshade separately; the former costs $140, and you can pick between a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-speaker-lamp-w-wi-fi-glass-shade-white-s79478292%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22724889%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-speaker-lamp-2021-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; ($39) or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-speaker-lamp-w-wi-fi-textile-shade-black-s99478291%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22724889%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-speaker-lamp-2021-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; ($29) shade. The glass shade — I reviewed the black one — is now open-ended and has a secondary, opaque glass cylinder running up the middle, which encircles the bulb. It’s still not going to be everyone’s taste, but the overall style is a bit more conservative and less likely to stand out for the wrong reasons. That said, if you despised how the original looked, I doubt you’ll reverse course after seeing the new model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TTmwCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jjFxAB"&gt;The lamp base has ditched the bottom saucer plate, which was where the controls were located on the older model. It’s noticeably shorter as a result and looks quite similar to Apple’s original HomePod. Ikea also moved away from the looks-like-a-dimmer-but-isn’t knob for turning the lamp on or off. Instead, there’s now a small circular button on the lower front area of the base for powering the light. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pRNFXOLSVSjMzZUYpYf8bXauanc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924391/IMG_0027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of a knob, the new lamp has a simpler power button for the lightbulb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EE1Qsy"&gt;One downside of this change is that while the old knob could be left to “on,” this simpler button doesn’t preserve the bulb’s state in the event it gets unplugged or if you lose power. That can get annoying if you’re using smart bulbs since you’ll have to walk over to the lamp and toggle the bulb power back on to control them remotely again. Around back are the usual Sonos controls for volume and play / pause. The volume buttons are easy to operate by feel since one is concave, and the other is convex. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vsmyd6CQVAiWva3oO9ozSAFvCVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924389/IMG_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lamp’s controls are around back and easy to use by feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gAoCWY"&gt;The 2019 Symfonisk lamp only supported lightbulbs with an E12 base, which came with a double whammy of being harder to find and outputting lackluster brightness for a table lamp. With the new model, Ikea has switched to the much more common E26 / E27 base. The company includes one of its own LED bulbs in the box, but you’ve got plenty of choices for smart bulbs from Philips Hue, LIFX, and others that will screw into the lamp if you want a dash of color or more flexible ways of controlling the light remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pt4Ei"&gt;Setting up the lamp speaker is a short process in the Sonos app: plug in the detachable, braided power cord, and it’s automatically detected and added to your whole-home audio system a few moments later. For the final step, you hold your phone near the device to finish linking it to your Sonos account through NFC. After that, the Symfonisk lamp acts like any other Sonos speaker you’ve got. You can group them together to get the same song playing throughout your living space or just have the lamp do its own thing. Like other modern Sonos speakers, the lamp supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, so it’s easy to play audio on it from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. If you buy two of the lamp speakers, they can be used as a stereo pair or serve as rear surrounds for one of Sonos’ soundbars. Assuming the design is to your taste, it’s a more subtle solution for surrounds than putting speakers on stands or wall-mounting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1i5SEr643BkU7-hBXDcBMEt1f5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924407/DSCF5823.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea is selling two different styles of lampshades for the Symfonisk lamp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tx9FQM"&gt;None of the Symfonisk products so far have come with built-in microphones, and that remains true with the second-gen lamp. To add voice controls to your Sonos system, you’ll either need one of the company’s voice-enabled speakers or to set up &lt;a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3439?language=en_US"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3486?language=en_US"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; if you already own a compatible device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Zt61rf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10805665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGQfWI"&gt;Ikea and Sonos say the second-generation Symfonisk lamp has a totally redesigned acoustic architecture. The most significant addition is a waveguide that’s meant to better disperse and spread the speaker’s sound around a room. (There’s a similar waveguide in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;picture frame speaker&lt;/a&gt;.) This means you won’t have to worry about a narrow “sweet spot” when finding a spot for the lamp; it should sound consistent regardless of where you place it in a room. But the re-engineered guts have changed the overall sound enough that the Symfonisk doesn’t sound as close to a Sonos One as the original did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToNfUZ"&gt;For its size, there’s a very satisfying level of bass, and vocals come through with good clarity. But other parts of the mix can sound less detailed compared to most Sonos speakers, and some instrumentation falls deeper into the background than I’d like. Listening to Kacey Musgraves’ new album &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, this speaker noticeably lacked some brightness and definition on her vocals and acoustic guitars on a song like “Hookup Scene.” There are EQ adjustments for treble and bass in the Sonos app, and you can also run TruePlay (if you have an iOS device) to further optimize the sound. But there’s always a slight muddiness to the speaker, though it’s not as present or obvious depending on what you’re listening to. That’s the tradeoff you’re making for the wider sound dispersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdOZbQ"&gt;If you’re looking for a decent speaker for a bedroom or office — and you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want it to double as a lamp — the new Symfonisk makes good on that hybrid functionality. But to me, the $99 bookshelf speaker remains the best value and most practical device in the Symfonisk lineup, especially when you put two of them together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9eK7NH"&gt;When it comes to the wall art speaker or the lamp, they are less versatile. You’re either looking for this very specific dual-purpose thing, or you’re probably not interested at all. If you are interested, the second-generation Symfonisk lamp fixes a lot of what Ikea got wrong the first time. It looks (slightly) more conventional, supports an easier-to-source bulb, and gets a wider audio spread out of the drivers inside. The notion of cloaking technology inside other, more inviting household appliances will definitely be a big plus for some. But if you’re already set on lamps and okay with displaying speakers that don’t hide their true purpose, you can do better for the money.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Every PC can now run Crysis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QkETamfJA3x2XZCNokTrsf7YOE=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993375/GFN_Thursday_Crysis_Remastered.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ifk895"&gt;But can it run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;? The answer is now yes, no matter what PC you own. Nvidia is bringing &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered &lt;/em&gt;to its GeForce Now streaming service this week, alongside &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Crysis 2 Remastered&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Crysis 3 Remastered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksHKsU"&gt;The remastered version of &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt; includes ray tracing and DLSS support, which can both be enabled by Founders or Priority members of Nvidia’s GeForce Now service. &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; will be available from Steam and Epic Games Store on GeForce Now today, with the full &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; available at launch tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qzz0sM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most PCs on the market today can stream ‘Crysis’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1QeeE"&gt;The vast majority of PCs on the market today, and even some of the budget gaming PCs that existed in 2007, can run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt; by streaming it from GeForce Now. Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce-now%2Fsystem-reqs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22725953%2Fcrysis-remastered-nvidia-geforce-now-available-streaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;system requirements&lt;/a&gt; include a dual-core 64-bit CPU (2GHz or faster) running Windows 7 or newer, 4GB of RAM, a GPU that supports DirectX 11 or newer, and at least a 15Mbps internet connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CCQ8N"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;, released in 2007, had a reputation for having high system requirements, and struggled to run on many PCs at the time of its release. “But can it run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;?” became part of internet culture, a long-running meme about PC hardware requirements. Several games have come close to the notoriety of &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;, including the release of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite multiplayer feels like an exciting return to form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8P4sBf8cMbUm-V_UperlQ3ghj8w=/0x0:1782x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993314/halo_infinite_mp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We couldn’t get enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TQ39AU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; arrives on December 8th, 2021, after over a year of delay, but the game seems truly worth the wait. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to launch alongside the Xbox Series X in November 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;but got pushed back&lt;/a&gt; after an underwhelming initial reveal that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21336060/halo-infinite-graphics-xbox-series-x-microsoft-one-windows-fan-reaction-memes"&gt;made the game into a meme&lt;/a&gt;. As of late 2021, it appears Microsoft may have turned things around big time. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665435/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview-september-24th"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer preview&lt;/a&gt; has gotten rave reviews and we’ve enjoyed it so much, we can’t wait to play more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWhCQU"&gt;Here’s what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Tom Warren and Sean Hollister loved, hated, and what we’re hoping to see when the full game comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMlxgW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Warren&lt;/strong&gt;: My favorite part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer is the new grappleshot. It’s game-changing for &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, both in terms of moving around maps and also the ability to grab objects. I’ve been using it mainly to parkour around as if I’m playing &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;, but once you master its uses beyond mobility, you can quickly grab the power weapons or repel yourself back onto a ledge if you just got hit by a repulsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uh5Cly"&gt;Some of the most entertaining clips I’ve seen throughout the beta have been by people grappling back onto ledges, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mintblitz/status/1445744553412030464?s=21"&gt;grabbing vehicles out of the sky&lt;/a&gt;, or just generally using the mobility of the grappleshot to get some truly impressive plays. It really feels like a mix of &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and Pathfinder’s grapple hook from &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="4Y7fvm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYqNCjG1vPw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QNLwPl"&gt;You need to find the grappleshot and pick it up before you can actually use it to grab things or move around quickly, and there’s a small cooldown and limited amount of uses so it doesn’t feel too overpowered. You can configure the training mode with unlimited grappleshot, and I almost want a dedicated mode where everyone has it equipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02Aq3E"&gt;If you haven’t managed to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; beta yet, it’s one of the tools you’ll want to master early on for multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPGfwq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean Hollister: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m a sucker for a great grappling hook, and I’ll echo Tom here: I’d love a mode where I could use it nonstop to grapple into, onto, and around everything. I’ve seen some amazing plays with the repulsor, too — like a single Spartan bouncing away a fully loaded Warthog like it was a two-ton tennis ball, securing a CTF victory for their team — but more often it seems like a way to boop people into bottomless pits. I prefer pulling myself &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of those pits with the grappling hook, and it’s exhilarating to do things like intentionally throw myself under a bridge, swing underneath, and pop up behind foes on the opposite side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="G0YrgU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is possibly the best use of the repulsor I've seen in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;November cannot come soon enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Via: &lt;a href="https://t.co/2yLSp6FhQ4"&gt;https://t.co/2yLSp6FhQ4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DIhklRpw1Y"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DIhklRpw1Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Looter Universe (@LooterUniverse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LooterUniverse/status/1444983093496975364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B9CB65"&gt;But my favorite part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;is simple: the gunplay. From the booming audio to the tremendous amount of damage they can put out against a shielded, armored soldier, every weapon feels incredibly powerful, every fight leaves me on the edge of my seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InvQZ1"&gt;Stray projectiles and covering fire are deadly enough, I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the pressure to put my head down, let my shield regenerate, or try another angle of attack entirely instead of poking out from cover again and again. I’m constantly calculating the risk / reward of a devastating melee attack or a grenade toss, because they’re just as satisfying as they’ve always been in classic &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games, as are the classic headshot-friendly pistol and spray-and-pray assault rifle you get by default in most matches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HqRzA"&gt;With a few obvious exceptions like the rocket launcher, sniper rifle, and giant spike thrower (which have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/godsewa/status/1443232801231417346"&gt;counters of their own&lt;/a&gt;), the weapons feel balanced enough that I never felt penalized for picking a different one just for fun variety. It’s the most fun I’ve had with &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; in years, after the most recent games tried to get a bit too tricky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTGrLucpuf2Yks1-20j7TjTM3HI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925717/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_12_131.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A grappling hook doesn’t keep you from getting shot out of the sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w85j3d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom: &lt;/strong&gt;I also love the movement in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. Mobility is always a key aspect of first-person shooters, and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;really encourages it with smooth sprinting, sliding, and vaulting. &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; really took movement mechanics to the extreme, with mechanics like the thrust slide that could boost your movement and allow you to outsmart opponents. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s movement changes are a lot more refined, very subtle, and have a clear skill gap to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSd4w"&gt;YouTuber Shyway demonstrated this really well, with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rKBzaSqHMeE"&gt;a 17-second clip&lt;/a&gt; showing off curb slides in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. While the comments are full of people saying &lt;em&gt;Titanfall &lt;/em&gt;movement is better (and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGWRAbSKXEI"&gt;he addresses that, too&lt;/a&gt;), these curb slides are actually a big change to a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game that doesn’t have easy-to-use thrust slides and lots of movement mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="nd2lNH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rKBzaSqHMeE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1KpgaF"&gt;I’ve also seen people demonstrate the mobility in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; really well on Twitter, and slide jumping is a fun mechanic, especially when you combine it with things like the grappleshot. I’m used to playing &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, which has a big focus on movement and mobility, so &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t feel slow in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mki0Fn"&gt;Once people start to master the curb slides, we’ll see some wild clips go viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c26nj0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;Frankly, I’m hoping there aren’t too many mobility tricks like the curb slide, and that they don’t dominate the game. Skill ceilings can make a lot of shooting games inaccessible to those who don’t play for a living, and so far I’ve been impressed that most skirmishes&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I’ve had in &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; felt like fair fights — losses where I’d have won if I’d played my cards right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEWoVr"&gt;We don’t know what the meta will be like quite yet, of course, since we were playing against foes with a similar lack of experience. We also don’t necessarily have a good handle on the maps: the test flights dropped us into a bare handful of small and / or extremely symmetrical levels, and I wonder if I’ll enjoy larger ones as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nu4mX"&gt;Not that any of those things will factor into my purchase decision: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;multiplayer will be free to play&lt;/a&gt;, a super exciting move that should hopefully ensure it’ll be easy to find a match at my skill level for years to come. Microsoft will be making its multiplayer money entirely off cosmetic items, it seems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZPn3O3cDbtbeap2dQKIukioe6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925721/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_25_237.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I call shotgun. HEY, wait for me!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6wAfjH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom:  &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t like the battle pass system, though. There are credits which appear to be available to purchase for real money, too. You can use credits to level up the battle pass and unlock rewards like consumables (double XP), armor, and other items. You can also level up the battle pass by completing challenges, but you don’t earn XP through regular play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAQCHk"&gt;I’m fine with the challenges existing, but I feel like there should be a way to earn XP based on the amount of time you’re playing the game. If you can truly buy credits from the store that let you level up the battle pass, then that’s veering too close to pay to win for me even if all you’re getting is cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PprZlF"&gt;The battle pass system is the only part of &lt;em&gt;Infinite &lt;/em&gt;that I’ve felt confused and irritated by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2YRxdLJMkWq3xrD5NnOe4zGt7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925723/HaloInfinite_2021_10_02_14_56_13_996.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We had high hopes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;for Microsoft’s 32:9 monitor support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It looks neat on an ultrawide &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Odyssey G9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, but I’m afraid the edges are pretty distorted.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8q7ZWP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;I do wonder how Microsoft will keep it engaging enough to keep paying players paying. I took a look at the different armor variants and colors, but there are only so many ways you can skin a set of armor, and Halo’s guns don’t have the mountains of attachments or variants you’d find in a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty,&lt;/em&gt; nor the unique heroes of an &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; to keep people buying and costuming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13Z63W"&gt;I’m fine just ignoring the paid extras, like I do in all free-to-play games. But here’s something I’d genuinely pay for: a mode that makes the vehicles bouncy and indestructible, like they were in the original 2001 &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. Want a good time? Get everyone on an OG &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; server to put their guns away and start Warthog jousting instead, then watch as the game’s bonkers physics system launches those vehicles spiraling into the sky. No shooting allowed: you’ve got to knock your foes out of their futuristic Humvees and run them over to win. It becomes a big floaty bullfight, or — with enough players — a piranha feeding frenzy. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; made vehicles destructible in &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt;, and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="SgpIBh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5d7AiVMoEM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VI1QfL"&gt;Either way, if &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; stays as fun as it was in these test flights, I’ll be playing a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of it. The bite-sized matches go by so quickly it’s hard to resist — it’s easy to fit one or two into my busy dad schedule, perhaps during my lunch break. Tom, you in?&lt;/p&gt;
