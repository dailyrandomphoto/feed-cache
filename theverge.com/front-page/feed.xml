    <title>Deck out your new Oculus Quest 2 with discounted accessories</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNjXUu"&gt;During the Christmas holiday, it was easy to pick up on the theme on Twitter that &lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;of you either bought or received an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. Well, in perfect timing, Oculus has discounted many of its official accessories for the Quest 2, which can help to protect your headset, as well as make it more comfortable to wear. We’ve seen promotions that discount these add-ons when you purchase a headset, but never by themselves, so that’s why they’re prominently featured today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnLZic"&gt;Best Buy has the best deal on the Elite Strap that replaces the fabric strap that comes with your Quest 2. It distributes the weight of the headset more evenly on your head, with adjusters on the top and rear of the Elite Strap. Normally $49, it’s just $34 at Best Buy (it’s $34 at Amazon, too, but it’ll ship in five to six weeks, apparently). It costs $39 at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my6nUQ"&gt;I recently bought one, and I’m about to buy another — not because I love them &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much, mind you. Based on my experience, they tend to last about a year under normal wear-and-tear, with the plastic side arms eventually breaking. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176820/oculus-quest-2-elite-strap-extended-warranty-quality-problems"&gt;Oculus now offers a two-year warranty on this product&lt;/a&gt;, and the company can replace broken straps free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8EKSeH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nghmP"&gt;I also recommend the Oculus Quest 2 zip-up case, which provides a safe place for your headset and controllers to reside when they aren’t in use. We’re also seeing this product discounted for the first time, from $49 down to $39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D05JMy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949359"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp04YA"&gt;Micro Center retail stores aren’t too common to find in the US, but if you have one near you, you can get the best price on Apple’s new AirPods Pro that offer MagSafe charging. These launched at $249.99, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/643985/apple-airpods-pro-active-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-with-magsafe-white"&gt;but they’re all the way down to $159.99&lt;/a&gt;. You can reserve a set online at the store closest to you, but you’ll need to actually make the trek to a Micro Center store to pick them up. That might be worth it to some, but don’t fret if it’s a no-go with you. We’re likely to see this deal at other retailers in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fn5wft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10934767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcMN6Y"&gt;The Microsoft 365 Family plan (one-year, auto-renewing, up to six people) — which gives you access to apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, as well as 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage for each person, and more — is selling for its normal $99.99 cost, but it comes with a complimentary $50 gift card. You’ll receive a digital code for Microsoft 365 Family, but the $50 Amazon gift card will be delivered by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LBWIAP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7NPcy6"&gt;In the latest round of “deals I should have had the patience to wait a few more weeks for,” &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei V&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is down to $34.99 from its normal $59.99 price. This game is often compared to &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s not an unfounded comparison, given that the franchise was spun out of &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niJ5Uj"&gt;You’ll find some similarities, primarily in the turn-based combat, the foes you’re up against, and the fact that they’re both long-lasting RPG adventures. Though, &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; has a reputation for being more difficult and brooding than &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;. They’re each great in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3UEPU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949375"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJb5co"&gt;Other deals that may interest you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZjkuIB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds-2nd-Gen-Wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-and-Alexa/dp/B085WTYQ4X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; with active noise cancellation and USB-C charging cost just $69.99 at Amazon, down from their normal $119.99 price. This model comes with a wired charging case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lgJHsK"&gt;We saw the bronze-colored Ember Smart Mug 2 selling at a discount before the holidays, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiidQHszZJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the white-colored mug is discounted&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy right now, costing $99.99. This is $30 off the usual cost.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>10 great games for your new gaming PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qq-NTAKtQxEt_Kmslg-0oH3UXG8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70319892/RoundUpArt_PCGames.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Armies, aliens, automobiles, the legendary mascot of the Xbox, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GFHxPA"&gt;Getting a new gaming PC is a bit like opening Pandora’s Box when it comes to deciding what to play. With frequent releases on Steam, a never-ending flow of free games on the Epic Games Store, a plethora of indie arthouse games on &lt;a href="http://itch.io"&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, and countless other launchers and storefronts to install and choose from, it can feel like the Netflix effect of paralysis by choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6gOx5"&gt;So if you got yourself a new PC for the holiday, or even earlier, this list of excellent games released this year is a primer on what to consider. Some may be no-brainers because they are the biggest releases of the last few months, but others should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IQNqTf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft rebrands Xbox Game Pass for PC to just PC Game Pass","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dnp1IP"&gt;Many titles featured here can be downloaded and played via a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fpc-games&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22803171%2Fgaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PC Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; subscription, the PC version of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, while subscribers to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22803171%2Fgaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; get access to games on both Xbox and PC platforms. Whether you prefer to buy each title individually or subscribe to gain access to many, here are our top games with which to initiate your new gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTOG50"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10929478" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lpYJYT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/riUhAOaGM7EavFnk8UI7wLk6GRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066588/HaloInfinite_Campaign01_3840x2160_WM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 343 Industries/Xbox Game Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite is the sixth installment in the mainline Master Chief saga.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7FtYW"&gt;This may be the most obvious first choice, as it’s arguably the biggest game release of the holidays, but &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s &lt;/em&gt;open world&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;promises to be both a technological test of PC hardware and a compelling title for some throwback solo campaign fun. Combine that with free-to-play online multiplayer that launched early, and &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;is back, baby! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzBI0f"&gt;Now, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821522/halo-infinite-campaign-levels-replay-mission-select-343-industries-microsoft"&gt;some oversights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;key features missing at launch&lt;/a&gt;, but there is still a lot to enjoy with &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; in its current form. It hopefully only gets better from here as they eventually expand it with campaign co-op and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816491/halo-infinite-multiplayer-deathmatch-slayer-dedicated-playlist"&gt;continue to grow the multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GNMgFs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Halo Infinite campaign review: playing the hits","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"},{"title":"Halo Infinite multiplayer feels like an exciting return to form","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22725770/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jqEcJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911150" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mXwXk4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HeNTbL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilyRfFzOxJ7w-U4eXC6JQ2Ou9K8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983830/ForzaHorizon5_Launch_Preview_06_16x9_WM.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 takes the open-world racer to the lush backdrop of Mexico.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBXiKW"&gt;What happens when you mix together a ton of cars, Playground Games’ open-world arcade racing franchise, and the beautiful landscape of Mexico? You get the best racing game of 2021, complete with AI Drivatars based on your friends list to challenge you. Part of the fun of &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;is you can play it however you want. Looking to embrace its hardcore motorsports side? There are cars and courses for that. Want to take it off-road in the mud and the muck? That’s here, too. Prefer to take it easy and just enjoy driving around? The rewind feature makes it easy to undo any careless errors that could cost you a race. &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;makes for a great pick-up-and-play experience, and there’s a lot to experience among all the cars and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sd8zMC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Forza Horizon 5 is the perfect portable Xbox game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762183/forza-horizon-5-perfect-portable-xbox-game-series-x-s-pc-steam"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ujow7l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911194" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n123m2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZGU1D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENjZLMU-vOM3c2vLD_xEw-5zwRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22976467/2021_10_27__7_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Daniel Mullins Games/Devolver Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inscryption mixes horror tones with a roguelike card game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LmkkLG"&gt;It doesn’t have to be spooky season for you to get into one of the top indie hits of the year. &lt;em&gt;Inscryption &lt;/em&gt;is a horror-themed deck-building card game with a blend of roguelike loop progression. The real trick, though, is how the game keeps changing things on you as the story progresses. We’re not going to get into spoilers here but be prepared for some unexpected turns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4qsXp"&gt;Even if you’re scarcely a fan of card games or escape rooms — even if you just played a couple of games of &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering &lt;/em&gt;as a kid or did one escape room with friends at their peak a few years ago — you should try out &lt;em&gt;Inscryption.&lt;/em&gt; It may not put your PC’s graphics to the test, but if you have a good monitor with quality black levels, you can really immerse yourself in the creepy aesthetic as you play cards and sacrifice little monsters to battle your eery AI opponent hiding in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="il2ieu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inscryption is part card game, part horror, and all-consuming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22757407/inscryption-review-pc-steam-devolver-digital"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="FNIDfX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911206" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TtCPC3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qx9cB9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20RUMuvIuxd5V2ymzgjdtuwqL-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071311/back4blood_thumbnail_05_en_18feb21.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Turtle Rock Studios/Warner Bros. Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood features four-player online co-op with card-based power-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk72TY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood &lt;/em&gt;is the spiritual successor to the &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;franchise of four-player co-op zombie shooters. It not only carries a similarly styled title but also maintains some of the original &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt; developers of Turtle Rock Studios. Now, &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; merges the classic, co-operative FPS action of &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead &lt;/em&gt;with a modern take on power-ups based around a card system. The cards make each session feel a bit different, keeping you on your toes as you mow down hordes of zombies and have to adapt to what fate draws you. Aside from the cards, the weapons and quip-filled characters are the stars of the show. Get yourself three friends to team up with and blast zombie after zombie until you’ve had your fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rMI3Dz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911258" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9qGP21"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zMIjgw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW8AwG7MYgxc9murgnGf7F5WIog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432857/aoe4_campaign_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV is the latest installment for the RTS series that first started in 1997.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xCZV09"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires &lt;/em&gt;series is old enough to be past its college life and struggling through a middling job while living in a crummy apartment, but &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV &lt;/em&gt;is a captivating new sequel that feels just like its roots. Anyone who has played a classic RTS before will be right at home here, though judging by conversations in &lt;em&gt;The Verge S&lt;/em&gt;lack channels, that home is a very addictive one. &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV &lt;/em&gt;expertly scratches that itch for base building, troop placement, and massive battles. The campaigns are quite dense, but be sure to try playing as the Mongols for a new twist on the old formula — with hit-and-run tactics and mobility being the new keys to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pZTWMm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The team behind Age of Empires IV wants you to learn history while playing the game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22375911/age-of-empires-4-history-lesson-documentary-footage-music-languages"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Rjudy3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911271" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sLTouM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NGJkHL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death’s Door&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkJZFKban6KfuQCebNRG7zaHzb8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071321/ss_dd9b5a2e40d3d512d1c978a5dfda5999c458a517.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acid Nerve/Devolver Digital&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death’s Door is an isometric souls-like action RPG with highly stylized artwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUeM6Y"&gt;There is no prettier game from 2021 than &lt;em&gt;Death’s Door. &lt;/em&gt;It’s enough of a joy just to look at, with a lush world that’s beautifully animated, but the gameplay feels part-&lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, part-&lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and all-satisfying when in action. The Nintendo Switch release just came out last month, but playing it on a PC to ensure the visuals are as juiced up as possible does wonders to make this lovely virtual space as immersive and captivating as can be. Don’t sleep on this indie hit. It’s a great way to spend a dozen or so hours of your time, and come on — the protagonist crow is just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; dang cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vkV74z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911277" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2B32MV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5iIxGo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels: Unleashed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRPMrz0XV7HwdTcplFkYBdbp15g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071342/hotwheelsunleashedsteam.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Milestone S.r.l.&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels Unleashed supersizes the stunt toy racers with a sense of speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nR6e0o"&gt;Imagine you’re a kid again and given an unlimited budget to build and race the zaniest Hot Wheels track you could possibly imagine. Now, even better, you’re an adult, and instead of tying up all your money and floor space in plastic tracks and 1:64 scale die-cast metal cars, you can play &lt;em&gt;Hot Wheels: Unleashed.&lt;/em&gt; But before you write this off as a kids’ video game, you must see the dedication the developers at Milestone put into all these toy car models. There are 60 cars for you to collect and race, with each one lovingly rendered down to its tiny toy details, with visible vehicle damage that looks a whole lot like the way actual Hot Wheels develop wear and tear. Add those visual stylings to the high-speed racing with split-screen support, and you have a fun arcade racer that looks and plays great on a high-end PC.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LnKuyH"&gt;If a game like &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; sounds appealing for its co-op chops, but you feel that zombies are a bit tired, check out &lt;em&gt;Aliens: Fireteam Elite. &lt;/em&gt;This is a three-player, third-person shooter pitting you against the xenomorphs of the storied &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; franchise lore. There’s a touch of RPG passive buffs to choose in your class loadouts, but in the end, it’s alien-shooting fun with friends. Keep your comms open and your tactics tight because these acid-blooded monsters like to swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the original Xbox title from 2005.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="scfyZW"&gt;Few games have had such critical acclaim and fan anticipation for a sequel as the original &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts&lt;/em&gt;. Now, 16 years later, the classic Double Fine action-adventure game finally gets its follow-up. Just like the original, &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 &lt;/em&gt;is brimming with charm, excellent voice acting, and fun writing that, while lighthearted, also tackles some deeply personal themes. It feels a bit like an older game, for better and worse, but with a fantastical-level design that is supremely unique. &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 &lt;/em&gt;takes you on a journey of joyous platforming and thought-provoking empathy. Don’t pass this one up, especially if you already have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boomerang X is a single-player first-person arena action game focusing on movement and speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bDP9WA"&gt;Few games exhibit a sense of speed and agility quite like &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X.&lt;/em&gt; The first-person action game is all about maintaining momentum as you fly around arenas by way of your character’s thrown boomerang. Throw it at enemies to slice them up, then vault towards it for aerial combos reminiscent of the visceral mid-air stunts of old &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; rocket jumps. The visual style and lighting of &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X &lt;/em&gt;ensure that each arena is fun to explore, and the enemies keep it fresh and challenging. While &lt;em&gt;Boomerang X &lt;/em&gt;is also available on Nintendo Switch, I believe playing it with a mouse and keyboard is the better experience. You get more pinpoint control, and it truly feels like a shooter of a bygone era with very fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation is a post-apocalyptic first-person photography game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CGnxjt"&gt;OK, so I cheated a little. &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;first&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;came out in 2020, not 2021. But double-check that headline and do the math — consider this just an added bonus because I cannot pass up any opportunity to recommend &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;and its &lt;em&gt;Macro &lt;/em&gt;DLC to anyone. The Nintendo Switch version did come out in 2021, but while it does feature new tilt controls, I believe it’s worth playing this excellent indie darling on a PC for the best representation of its awesome visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATEN5j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation &lt;/em&gt;is a first-person photography game that drips with style and weaves an excellent narrative through environmental storytelling. Enjoy its vibrant aesthetic, expansive photographic camera controls, and fantastic soundtrack by ThorHighHeels — all while the sense of dread sets in from its post-apocalyptic world. Remember, even if you don’t want to watch the world burn, you don’t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This ambitious smart ring hopes to one day monitor chronic illnesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Renders of four Movano Rings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNDHV5n5_O-AjPSfu20XWudMsT8=/75x0:2325x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70319577/Offset_Ad.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movano Ring is a smart ring with medical ambitions&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Movano&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23UKBW"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only smart ring on the block anymore. For CES 2022, health tech company &lt;a href="https://movano.com/"&gt;Movano&lt;/a&gt; is announcing the Movano Ring, a wearable that aims to help people affordably monitor chronic illnesses and better understand their data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oe4p0F"&gt;The Movano Ring will measure all the basic metrics, including heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), sleep, respiration, temperature, blood oxygen levels, steps, and calories burned. However, instead of a raw data dump, Movano says it’ll distill how your metrics relate to each other “take a more proactive approach to mitigating the risks of chronic disease.” For example, the Movano app might tell you how your exercise habits impact your sleeping patterns or HRV over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ei3Xae"&gt;This isn’t surprising — more wearable makers are shifting away from steps and calories in favor of simplified scores and insights. The Oura Ring, Whoop, and Fitbit all use scores to contextualize sleep and recovery data but mostly focus on telling you whether to push yourself or take it easy on a given day. They’re also accompanied by graphs and lengthy descriptions that can, at times, be overwhelming. Movano says it wants its insights to be more actionable. So far, the app screenshots that Movano showed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; don’t show anything groundbreaking, but the way the data is presented is more digestible than many trackers out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Movano app describing how a user’s data shows that they sleep better on days they exercise" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVPl6LzTQlsCOBT2btO2DYxjFvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120760/IndividualScreens3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Movano&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plenty of wearables offer similar data, but the way it’s presented here is much easier to digest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QFWf1a"&gt;There are a few other things that help the Movano Ring stand out. For starters, the device itself isn’t hideous and is impressively slim. The emphasis on a sleeker design was a deliberate choice, says Movano CEO Dr. John Mastrototaro, as the device was specifically designed for women of all ages. That’s notable in two ways. First, wearable tech has historically favored traditionally masculine styles and sizes. Smart rings like the Oura Ring and the now-defunct Motiv Ring have also tended to be on the chunkier side. That’s mainly because it’s hard to miniaturize sensors with current technology, but a side-effect is that they’re less suitable for petite hands. A truly slim and sleek smart ring would be a first. Second, only a handful of wearables companies take a women-first approach. Some have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-study-affirms-that-women-do-in-fact-have-cramps-d-1846431781"&gt;tried addressing the issue&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still a &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/davos-2020/5764698/gender-data-gap/"&gt;huge gender gap&lt;/a&gt; in medical data. (Fun fact: it wasn’t until 1993 that Congress &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy/inclusion/women-and-minorities/guidelines.htm#:~:text=The%20NIH%20Revitalization%20Act%20of,and%20minorities%20in%20clinical%20research.&amp;amp;text=The%20statute%20includes%20a%20specific,and%2C%20in%20particular%20clinical%20trials."&gt;mandated women and minorities be included in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsywLv"&gt;But the big thing is that while most wearable companies sidestep questions about FDA approval, Movano is frank about its medical ambitions. According to Mastrototaro, while the first Movano Ring won’t have FDA clearances, the goal is to eventually get &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumers-medical-devices/learn-if-medical-device-has-been-cleared-fda-marketing"&gt;Class II designation&lt;/a&gt; and add medical features like non-invasive glucose monitoring and cuffless blood pressure in a “step-by-step” manner over time. To do that, the company is conducting clinical trials for its radio frequency-enabled tech and algorithms, as well as accuracy studies to gain FDA clearance for heart rate, SpO2, and respiratory rate monitoring. Non-invasive glucose monitoring and cuffless blood pressure are holy grails for wearable tech — and big names, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-study-blood-pressure/"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;, have been rumored to be working on these features for smartwatches. Bringing them to a smart ring would be an impressive achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three copper Movano Rings stacked on top of each other" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFQZ4-WnikwghhYL0thTljObn9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121243/Stack_Copper.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Movano&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s miraculously not chunky — a big win for smart rings if this ever gets to market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kkV5iI"&gt;That said, consumer wearables promising medical features often end up in regulatory limbo. The Withings ScanWatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048522/withings-health-monitoring-scanwatch-ecg-afib-heart-sleep-apnea-blood-oxygen"&gt;made its debut&lt;/a&gt; at CES in January 2020, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22772984/withings-scanwatch-blood-oxygen-sleep-apnea-watch-fda"&gt;wasn’t until November 2021&lt;/a&gt; that it obtained the FDA clearance necessary to hit the US market. Its Move ECG smartwatch was announced even earlier but still has yet to receive clearance. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-first-smartwatch-to-read-your-blood-pressure-is-an-1833612732"&gt;Omron’s HeartGuide blood pressure smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; also took several years to clear. It often means companies end up choosing between making consumer wellness devices that lack medical credibility or niche medical devices that are inaccessible to the average person. However, Mastrototaro says Movano’s got a secret trump card: decades of regulatory experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niZwNi"&gt;“We’re taking the regulatory side of things very seriously,” Mastrototaro told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He also pointed to his long history in developing medical devices, including the first continuous glucose monitor, as well as that of his staff. That experience, Mastrototaro says, gives Movano an edge in navigating the FDA’s notoriously opaque clearance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4azG2"&gt;The Movano Ring won’t be available until the second half of 2022, and even then, it’ll be a beta version. We also don’t have any concrete details for pricing, though Mastrototaro says the company aims for it to be “one of the most affordable” on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGb5gZ"&gt;“We’re aiming for both a medical and consumer focus — the intersection of these two fields as opposed to one or the other. We want to have the look, feel, and affordability of a consumer device with the accuracy and reliability of a medical device,” says Mastrototaro. What Mastrototaro is describing is the holy grail of wearable tech. We’ll have to see if the Movano Ring ends up being another CES pipedream, but it’s certainly one of the more ambitious takes on smart rings that we’ve seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Display shows off a versatile lineup of transparent OLED screens at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNYriOXOEEcwL03j23fxud8vjbo=/0x344:4968x3656/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70318789/lg_display_oled_shelf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Shelf displaying a piece of art. | Photo by LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TpdYwA"&gt;LG Display has come up with more uses for transparent screens with its innovative new concepts that will be on display at CES 2022: the OLED Shelf, Shopping Managing Showcase, Show Window, and Smart Window. The company is not to be confused with LG Electronics, as LG Display simply creates concepts that other companies can adopt and introduce to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0g2SAL"&gt;Its OLED Shelf, visible at the top of this story, consists of two 55-inch transparent OLED displays mounted on top of one another, with a shelf at the very top. LG Display says it’s ideal for the living room, where it can display art, a TV show, or one on each of the two screens simultaneously. Always on Display Mode ensures that the screen can stay on all the time. If there was a piece of art on display, that image could stay put just like a painting, all while blending into the wall behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MOA40sMjzUR3F_O_O50uULPUzBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23127627/lg_display_oled_shelf.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another view of the OLED Shelf, with the opaque roll-down material visible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2a1JS8"&gt;There’s actually room for you to put an &lt;em&gt;actual &lt;/em&gt;painting behind the screens, too, which you’d be able to see when they’re off. LG’s also devised a motorized sheet of opaque material which rolls down like a projector screen to make their images more vibrant and less ethereal. (Images viewed on transparent screens can sometimes look ghostly.) The pedestal you see in the image above houses some of the electronics, and the screens take standard HDMI input.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MeCIKk9roNDbtaLfYu46Xn91KP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23126574/lg_display_shopping_managing_showcase.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Shopping Managing Showcase highlights perfume.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kshY5v"&gt;While the OLED Shelf is built for the home, LG Display says its Shopping Managing Showcase is meant for “luxurious” department stores. A transparent OLED display is attached to a sleek wooden stand, and when placed in front of physical products, it looks like it could create a futuristic shopping experience. It adds an overlay to the items behind it, which means storeowners could add graphics that highlight certain parts of their products, or even use the display to provide funky visual effects. We saw a video where flowy graphics drew our eye to one of the perfume bottles in the display above, giving it a lustrous halo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnW79D9WskNuChLLtOwci_HQKc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23126581/lg_display_show_window.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The LG Display Show Window could create unique window displays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7z32Wp"&gt;LG Display also gave us a glimpse of its Show Window, another business-focused model that consists of four 55-inch transparent OLED displays that could be used to play up products in window displays — instead of window decals, stores could add digital text, which can easily be changed at any time. The company says versions of it are already on display at &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/05/lg-display-x-musinsa-transparent-oled-trendiness/"&gt;the new Musinsa fashion store&lt;/a&gt; in Seoul, as well as art exhibitions &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/12/a-hopeful-future-with-oled-art-at-the-smithsonian/"&gt;at The Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/10/transparent-oled-lights-up-londons-art-scene/amp/"&gt;at 180 The Strand in London&lt;/a&gt;, inside some subway car windows in China and Japan, and &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2021/08/bvlgari-colors-come-alive-through-oled/"&gt;a Bulgari fashion show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMQ0Io"&gt;The company also showed off its Smart Window, another transparent OLED screen that can be for video calls or presentations in the office, however, it didn’t provide any images of that display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EricDE"&gt;Since these transparent displays are just concepts, we probably won’t see many of them in the real world, but that doesn’t change the fact that they’re still pretty darn cool to look at — and LG Display says it’s ready to help customers produce some of them if they want. “If any of our customers want, we can provide [the OLED Shelf],” LG Display spokesperson Jean Lee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying it’s ready for production. All of these displays consist of the same 55-inch 1080p transparent OLED panels with 40 percent transparency, which Lee says is on the company’s 8th generation display manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teuIkK"&gt;LG Display has been in the transparent display game for a while now, revealing its &lt;a href="https://news.lgdisplay.com/global/2014/07/lg-display-unveils-18-inch-flexible-and-transparent-oled-panels/"&gt;first flexible and see-through screen in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, it showed off a transparent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223774/lg-transparent-oled-tv-display-55-inch-smart-bed-ces-2021"&gt;TV screen mounted to the foot of a bed&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn’t just dabble in transparent screens — the company is also showcasing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850959/lg-display-media-chair-virtual-ride-concepts-ces-2022"&gt;half-moon-shaped chair with a built-in OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; at CES this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2E5iA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:58 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly hires away Meta’s AR public relations head</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pF74kp-qt5CHXXQ-TkkLdBwnpvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70318197/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="th1dJ0"&gt;Apple has reportedly hired Andrea Schubert, Meta’s communications and public relations lead for its augmented reality (AR) products, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman in his &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter. Schubert’s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrearagni"&gt;LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; indicates that she’s been working for Meta for nearly six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cMjdet"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Meta, with Oculus, has been the market leader in headsets, so such a hire makes sense as Apple nears its launch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rValof"&gt;“Meta, with Oculus, has been the market leader in headsets, so such a hire makes sense as Apple nears its launch,” Gurman explains. On both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810083/cyber-monday-spending-down-early-shopping"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, Meta’s Oculus Quest 2 was one of the top-selling products. Not to mention that Meta’s Oculus app &lt;a href="https://apptopia.com/store-insights/top-charts/itunes-connect/top-overall/united-states"&gt;topped the App Store&lt;/a&gt; in the US on Christmas Day, and became the number one free app on the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/top"&gt;Google Play store today&lt;/a&gt;, a potential sign that a significant amount of people received the headset as a gift this holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrmLwX"&gt;Rumors continue to swirl around Apple’s AR/VR headset, with Apple remaining tight-lipped about the product. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; previously reported that the headset could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;cost a whopping $3,000 and come with 8K displays&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;3D sensors for hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;. The headset may also have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;rely on a connected iPhone or Mac&lt;/a&gt; for processor-heavy tasks. We might not have to wait too much longer for Apple to officially take the wraps off of the rumored headset, however. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the mixed-reality headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;could launch sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Northman, Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, The Silent Sea, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7H5T7svM9oLrk-Cy3O1k0INLnE=/336x0:1556x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317886/northman2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alexander Skarsgård is out for revenge in The Northman  | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMSdFM12hOw&amp;amp;ab_channel=FocusFeatures" target="_blank"&gt;Focus Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XDD6bS"&gt;Hello and welcome to the final trailers roundup for 2021, I hope you have enjoyed reading (and watching) these roundups as much as I have enjoyed writing them. There were a lot of really good streaming shows and movies this year despite the persistence of the coronavirus that disrupted so much of our lives. Among my personal favorites were &lt;em&gt;Loki, Succession, Ted Lasso, The Beatles: Get Back, King Richard, and Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; (pls someone pick up this show it was just getting started!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4s8Pvh"&gt;This week’s list has Vikings, Hercule Poirot, and a look at the upcoming Showtime series about the early days of Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ov081F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMSdFM12hOw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VYoUCu"&gt;The Northman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6MqYBM"&gt;Director Robert Eggers (&lt;em&gt;The Witch&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;), said in an &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/trailers/alexander-skarsgard-the-northman-trailer-video/"&gt;interview with EW&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The Northman&lt;/em&gt; was “by far the hardest thing” he’s done. These are not warm and fuzzy Vikings, let’s put it that way. As a child, Amleth, the heir to the Viking throne, witnesses his uncle Fjolnir murder his father. King Aurvandi, providing him with the mantra “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” And side note, even though they all speak English, the Vikings (in the trailer at least) have what sound like appropriate Scandinavian accents. Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, and Willem Dafoe star in &lt;em&gt;The Northman,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hl9ZW1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c3srHCvDAFE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QnMIru"&gt;Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk2VUe"&gt;Based on the book of the same name by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist Mike Isaac, &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber&lt;/em&gt;, is the story of how Travis Kalanick founded the ride-hailing startup that became the unicorn that every VC in Silicon Valley wanted in on (or at least, they did in the beginning). Kalanick was ultimately ousted from the CEO role of the company he founded, but not before a lot of drama, both in public and behind the scenes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Uma Thurman, and Kyle Chandler star in &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Showtime February 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fqwsud"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Af_Hj0MDBBQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oDTqIn"&gt;The Silent Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NVZ1VX"&gt;OK so this trailer isn’t&lt;em&gt; brand&lt;/em&gt; new but this series looks cool as hell. The Earth is a dried up husk, and a team of astronauts are heading to the Moon on a mission to retrieve an “important sample” from a research station. They crash land on the Moon and then discover all is not well at Balhae Station and the government (gasp) may have lied to them (plus, in what seems a nice homage to the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; movies, their tracking device detects “bio-signals” approaching them). Gong Yoo, Bae Doona, and Lee Joon star in &lt;em&gt;The Silent Sea&lt;/em&gt;, which debuted its first episode on Netflix December 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q3SEwz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZRqB0JLizw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rdu8NN"&gt;Death on the Nile &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LXZKo3"&gt;Kenneth Branagh’s version of one of Agatha Christie’s best-known Hercule Poirot mysteries is one of the many theatrical releases that was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Poirot is aboard a ship on the Nile River, when a murder occurs and he has to determine who among the ship’s passengers is responsible. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/death-on-the-nile-trailer-armie-hammer.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, Armie Hammer is still in &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt; (there’s a mere glimpse of him in this trailer), despite some &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/armie-hammer-scandal-death-on-the-nile-disney-1235065530/"&gt;apparent discussion within Disney&lt;/a&gt; of reshooting his scenes or removing him digitally after the actor was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. Gal Gadot, Annette Bening, Russell Brand, Ali Fazal, Dawn French, Tom Bateman, Rose Leslie, Emma Mackey, Sophie Okonedo, Jennifer Saunders, and Letitia Wright also star in &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xXt3W5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rt_UqUm38BI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WT3Z1s"&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dNGEOn"&gt;This trailer for this sequel to &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; originally appeared after the end credits of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, and takes place after the end of that movie. Strange warns that “the multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little,” so of course the movie brings him deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe concept of alternate timelines. Wanda Maximoff, Wong, and Mordo return, and we meet America Chavez, one of the Young Avengers from the comics. Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and  Xochitl Gomez star in &lt;em&gt;Doctor&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters May 6th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla owner blows up Model S instead of footing $22,600 repair bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qY14_97HFXtl50zv2sGh92dQvAM=/7x0:2140x1422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317450/tesla_model_s_dynamite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Tesla Model S strapped with dynamite. | Screenshot from Pommijätkät via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_9aVzf5fC4" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m64vjh"&gt;When faced with a repair bill that costs half of what you paid for your car, do you go through with the expensive repair, bring it to the junkyard, or sell it for parts? Finnish Tesla owner Tuomas Katainen decided to do something a little more extreme — but arguably a lot more satisfying — when faced with such a situation: he watched his car go up in flames, as noted in a report from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/finnish-man-passes-on-paying-22-600-to-replace-his-tes-1848268874"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJ1Bx2"&gt;Katainen handed his 2013 Tesla Model S over to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr1cNqiNxK46w93zw9KfTLg"&gt;Pommijätkät&lt;/a&gt;, a group of explosion experts on YouTube who loves to make things go “boom,” after he was quoted $22,600 for a battery replacement. “Well when I bought that Tesla, the first 1,500km [932 miles] were nice,” Katainen recounted. “Then, error codes hit.” After Katainen brought his Tesla to a mechanic, he found out that the only way to fix the car would be to replace the entire battery pack, which would cost him at least 20,000€, or around $22,600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sfxczS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The group behind Pommijätkät strapped 66 pounds of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ydxxt"&gt;I think anyone would be pretty frustrated at that point, considering that the base price for a new 2013 Tesla Model S started at $57,400, later &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/2013-model-s-price-increase"&gt;increasing to $59,900&lt;/a&gt; when the car first came out. Even &lt;a href="https://www.carfax.com/Used-2013-Tesla-Model-S_z25929"&gt;a standard used model&lt;/a&gt; currently goes for around $30,000 at the lowest. That’s probably why Katainen picked up the Tesla from the shop and told the mechanic that he’s going to “explode the whole car away.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ISQBF"&gt;For context, these cars come with an eight-year (or up to 150,000 miles) &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/vehicle-warranty"&gt;battery and drive unit warranty&lt;/a&gt;, but the warranties on older models are starting to expire, revealing the potential cost behind a full battery replacement. In September, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/13/tesla-battery-pack-replacement-repair/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported on a Tesla owner in need of a battery replacement on a Model S that was no longer under warranty. As noted in the report, he was quoted $22,500 from Tesla, but ended up getting a repair for $5,000 from a third-party shop. Katainen’s quote was also from Tesla, and it’s unclear whether he had access to an alternative repair service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKwuNs"&gt;Either way, the group behind Pommijätkät strapped 30kg (66 pounds) of dynamite to the car and parked it in an old quarry in Jaala, Finland. Even Elon Musk was there — well, at least in spirit. A crash test dummy outfitted with a helmet, thick winter jacket, and a picture of Musk’s face was dropped in by helicopter and then stuffed in the driver’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1mmlC"&gt;Katainen triggers the explosion from inside a nearby bunker, and Tesla erupts in a ball of fire, with what seems like thousands of pieces scattering throughout the snowy landscape. The group picks up whatever was left of the car, which amounts to just a pile of scraps. When asked whether he’s ever had this much fun behind the wheel of a Tesla, Katainen replies, “No, never enjoyed this much with Tesla!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;New phone, new start  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="c7hvJS"&gt;So, you just unwrapped a shiny new iPhone this holiday season. A new year is around the corner. And while you could just migrate over all the same apps you’ve always used, now is also a good time to try something new. It doesn’t matter whether you’re rocking a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; or a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; — here’s a list of some apps that are handy, fun, or just way better than whatever came pre-installed on your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="A4rBKi"&gt;Spark Mail&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of Spark email app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KcqBa7jR-5Vz3ioJbNKNvb2hf38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073892/IMG_2343_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Readdle Technologies&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spark isn’t the prettiest email client, but it gets a lot of things right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CgBYTi"&gt;Listen, Apple’s Mail app is fine. Gmail is marginally better. Microsoft Outlook is a classic for a reason. But Spark Mail is a simple, solid, and free option that packs in a lot of customizability. You have the option of toggling on smart notifications (no more notifications from that random service you signed up for six years ago) and integrating with services like Dropbox and OneDrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zzEJRO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910896" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rzF6Nz"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Y52SSp"&gt;Todoist&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Todoist screenshots" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C4a2EiRJFx8Hm3WNekl8gxwHHg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073912/IMG_2345.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Doist&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Todoist lets you create lists for simple tasks and projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PrbL7s"&gt;Sure, you could stick with Apple’s Reminders app, but there are way better options out there. Todoist is a good place to start — especially if you need something with a little more power than a bullet list in your Notes app or that sticky note you crammed in your pocket. It’s a flexible tool for everything from personal errands to work projects. It also works with a ton of third-party apps like Slack, Calendar, and Spark.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="er03MV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910901" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XMsYFL"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Z8CzwO"&gt;Planta&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of Planta app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WTUjnyuLlNaS6albAcSOBAUtYIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073925/IMG_2347.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Stromming&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My plants only live because of Planta, honestly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl6Cyp"&gt;If you have struggled to keep a plant alive, you are not alone. Who truly has the discipline to check soil moisture levels every day? While there are a lot of plant apps out there, Planta is the only one that’s helped me keep any of them alive — and, dare I say, thriving. It helps you determine which plants should go where in your home, tells you when to water and re-pot, and alerts you with temperature warnings for your outdoor babies. It can also ID that mystery plant your auntie gifted you. There’s a free version, as well as several other subscription options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NbDqN4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910980" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wWXCJv"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="OjdZA1"&gt;Strava&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of Strava app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v05oapaOd7OeM6-Qa_kjPkwmq6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073962/IMG_2349.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Strava&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strava has tons of data to keep the nerds happy, but is simple enough for beginners too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pK7qIR"&gt;If you want to be more active, few apps do it better than Strava. You don’t need a fitness tracker or smartwatch (though you can integrate many of the popular ones), and it supports a variety of activities, including staples like biking, running, and walking. There’s a ton of third-party integrations as well, making it easy to use as a hub for all your exercise goals. On top of challenges where you can earn discounts on fitness gear, there are also thoughtful personal safety features and lots of ways to measure your progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOJWHH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10910992" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fUzL4q"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PW0VnD"&gt;YNAB&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of YNAB mobile app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTtHXf2AyIseHirs74Z4CJotSnA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073986/iPhone_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: YNAB&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YNAB is a little pricey, but is one of the best proactive budgeting tools out there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pMBBSg"&gt;The title says it all: You Need a Budget. If you really want to be proactive about how you’re spending and saving for the future, YNAB is hard to beat. The categories and methodology might seem a little daunting at first, but you can make it as complicated or simple as you need. It comes with two subscription options — $98.99 yearly or $14.99 monthly — that can feel a bit steep. However, in my several years of using it, I found that the app paid for itself within the first month. That said, there’s a 34-day free trial for you to see if it’s worth it for you. Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mint-budget-expense-tracker/id300238550?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200"&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; is another great and free option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3nMq03"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911011" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1qzwqO"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lfK2d9"&gt;Libby&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencap of Libby app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOqU3svW9iSXSDdHb2EEIjrh620=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073997/IMG_2360.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Overdrive&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libby is a must-have for bookworms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="paHY0B"&gt;Buying e-books adds up, especially if you’re a voracious bookworm. Libby lets you connect with your local library to borrow books, magazines, and audiobooks for free. You can read within the app itself or send your books to your Kindle. A nice perk: Libby automatically syncs across your devices, so it doesn’t matter which device you’re reading on. It also integrates with CarPlay and allows for offline reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="foSqMb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911018" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TR8wCg"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tkXLAc"&gt;Tody&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencap of Tody app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Lm4VRAmyBugXwUv2Xn5QnogCW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074010/IMG_2354.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: LoopLoop&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tody helps save time by spreading out your cleaning tasks in more manageable chunks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4LL1aR"&gt;Do you know how often you’re supposed to sharpen your knives or oil your cutting boards? How about when to change your shower liner or flip the mattress? Tody is a handy customizable app that automatically notifies you when it’s time to clean what and when. You can organize chores by room, assign tasks to your family or housemates, and complete against Dusty, a dust gremlin, to keep things fun (and clean). For the neat freaks among us, it also helps you visualize how clean your home is — and settle arguments about who’s &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; doing most of the cleaning. It’s got a one-time fee of $6.99, but there are no further in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mN0kEU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911024" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8kV7CM"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PjBQUK"&gt;1Password&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of 1Password" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5t3tDPHpXHRsvk9F7ZkJdvCGoU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074022/Categories___Light.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: AgileBits&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password is one of several password managers you can download to keep your accounts safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jCchV4"&gt;Password managers are security hygiene 101. Personally, I like 1Password because it also works with my Apple Watch and is compatible across multiple platforms. It works with Touch and FaceID, is easy to set up, and even securely saves your credit card info for online shopping. It’ll also alert you to which of your passwords aren’t great, and it’s simple to generate new ones on the fly. There isn’t a free version, unfortunately (you do get a 30-day trial), but there are plenty of other free password managers to choose from, such as &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dashlane.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22824153%2Fiphone-best-apps-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, and even the ones built into Safari / Google Chrome. Each has its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to"&gt;advantages and disadvantages&lt;/a&gt; — but any password manager is better than none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fHSLLu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911079" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="45lxz2"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="MoeEdv"&gt;Calm&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of Calm app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VAOQQyeX6Y5ztqpiAW_q9-9HnA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074037/IMG_2355.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Calm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re all stressed, but Calm has several helpful meditations. Who doesn’t want Idris Elba to lull them to sleep?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Sjj1u"&gt;It’s been a stressful time for everybody. The nice thing about Calm is that it has meditations to suit your specific needs, like increased focus, reduced anxiety, or just daily topics to ruminate on. If mindfulness isn’t your cup of tea, Calm also has a number of sleep stories and music tracks. Sure, you already probably have YouTube and its dozens of free white noise videos, but sometimes it’s nice drifting away to Idris Elba reading you a bedtime story. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headspace-mindful-meditation/id493145008?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; is another popular option that’s geared more toward beginners if you just want to dip your toe into the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lzIh6U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911090" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="p3R3l7"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EisKsl"&gt;Splitwise&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screencaps of Splitwise app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlDrRw1ETDIOxuGSUZrXAW1Vg8Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073972/splitwise_ios_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Splitwise&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splitwise makes it clear who owes who, and for what. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L0uTOu"&gt;Venmo is great and all, but it’s also nice to have a running record of all the moolah you owe your friends, family, and housemates. While there is a paid tier, the free version does everything you need it to, from automatically splitting bills, logging recurring expenses, and linking out to Venmo to pay those expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZNICwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911096" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EwxKif"&gt;
&lt;p id="EIvAN7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>9 great Android apps for your new 2021 Android device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9tIzFxLcRqeqzntLE3sLvPCZWvw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70317351/RoundUpArt_AndroidApps.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A privacy-minded roundup of apps, including a self-care penguin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zj20b0"&gt;Congratulations on your new Android device! After going through all the legalese to set up your Google account and services (and probably doing the same with your phone manufacturer and carrier), you’re finally ready to make your phone or tablet your own. As you populate your email app with new emails and purge useless apps from your device, now is the time to install some better apps that will improve your life. Here are nine Android apps that made me happier and more organized, without being overly demanding of my user data or annoying with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOVFJu"&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PL8r78rs9xiI0HgUZfZnZSYDmuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097002/Screenshot_20211214_190728.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Notes&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ColorNote Notepad Notes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ColorNote app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Gg2F_00MemnHcWgmFtsuwdCTHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097012/Screenshot_20211214_191628.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ouxxfg"&gt;My home is full of post-it notes strategically placed on multiple surfaces: my desk, boxes, and even the cutting board. And they all serve different purposes: some are shopping lists, some are reminders to return an item, and some are just my to-do lists. The ColorNote app is basically a digital version of my sticky note addiction but organized into a single screen. You can create either a text note or a checklist and customize its color to help you differentiate one from another. The app has a calendar where you can note important dates, share individual notes with your friends and family, or even sync your notes across multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LESRm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925165" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CLZbrU"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smTWTg"&gt;Notebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQCampC59WZmgd2-S_QMwdouvx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097020/Screenshot_20211214_192140.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notebook app by Zoho Corporation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAOCy1bTDCdgfLKUUFktjQeDTP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097181/Screenshot_20211214_202422.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YzSTKC"&gt;It’s handy to have a robust note-taking app on your phone: this way, you can jot down detailed notes, include relevant photos from your work meeting, and keep a journal, all on the same device. The free Notebook app from Zoho organizes your notes into digital notebooks with gorgeous digital covers and provides powerful tools to help you document anything and everything. You can embed multimedia elements like sketches, photos, and even audio files into your written notes to add context and can add as many pages as you need. Your data is stored locally, but you can sync your notebooks across multiple devices (including Windows, macOS, and iOS) if you have a Zoho account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52mgxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925177" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K0JWXn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wA7WOD"&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUXraJAUk_s6MrfrLwKT7UfP3DY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097035/Screenshot_20211214_192518.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Finch Cares&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finch: Self-Care Widget Pet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finch, the self-care widget pet app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dK8_QldNXYPrqLlWbhLsQahIbSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097039/Screenshot_20211214_192529.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qZkGk8"&gt;We’re coming up to year two of the pandemic, and everyone is feeling various degrees of isolation and exhaustion. Good thing Finch, the self-care pet penguin, is here to guide us to take better care of our mental health. He lives inside the app and prompts you to practice self-care each day: he’ll check in on your mood and will tell you to stretch and set goals periodically, which will earn energy points to help him on his adventures. There is plenty to do in the free version, but you can upgrade to Finch Plus for more self-care exercises; it costs $39.99 for a one-year subscription. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dF31SE"&gt;If you rather track your mental wellness without the gamification of Finch, the CBT Companion app (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) is a more pragmatic alternative. It offers a safe (and free) space to document your thoughts and provide exercises to practice your CBT skills, whether you’re working with a clinician or not. You can also pay $9.99 per month or $49.99 every six months to access additional exercises and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AP2SSp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925215" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TW1fw"&gt;Given how brazen porch pirates are these days, it’s more important than ever to know the delivery status of all the packages you’re expecting — whether they’re gifts for friends and family or groceries that need to be refrigerated as soon as possible. AfterShip lets you manually enter each package you’re expecting (rather than demand access to all your emails like other apps) — you just have to provide the tracking number and name the courier delivering the package, and the app can figure out the rest. It’ll show you where each package is on a map, as well as its current status (I usually have to tap on the name of the courier to see the latest update). This way, you’ll know when to expect a package to arrive, so you can grab it before a porch pirate can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="o5r7Oq"&gt;Ever since Google announced that it will be shutting down Hangouts, a chat app that my parents know and love, I’ve been on the hunt for another easy-to-use up chat app. Discord, the platform beloved by gamers, might just be&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;one. First, I like that you only need to provide your email address to sign up for an account, and you can invite specific people to join your server or room. Within your own private space, you can chat with your friends and family using text or GIFs or have the option to start a video or voice call, whether they have the app or use the web interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Xsadp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925236" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="SFpOKa"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nW1rtw"&gt;Firefox Browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Firefox mobile web browser app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqOQRggIBEPWzae3fVm8Q8_MUyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097107/Screenshot_20211214_195145.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox Browser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Firefox mobile web browser app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7ZAPWs6VEZ9FWUzMjDmu8GM4WM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097109/Screenshot_20211214_195340.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kl4ZgI"&gt;I got so fed up with the algorithmically generated news on the Chrome web browser’s homepage that I started using the Firefox mobile browser on my phone instead. Like the desktop version, the mobile Firefox browser can block trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers, and fingerprinters. Without these sneaky little things following you around, you can just surf the web as usual, though some sites might break without being able to collect data on you. You can even customize your browser by changing it to Dark Mode or moving the search bar to the bottom of the screen to make it easier to use on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FszHNp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925291" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mgvW1T"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d02Tb4"&gt;Paprika Recipe Manager 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Paprika recipe manager app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8A0l6J8821CBKadqXYtbvG3Az0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097156/Screenshot_20211214_201055.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paprika Recipe Manager 3 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Paprika recipe manager app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aSY23A8WJoZNU8XLtZwe6D6_sCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097161/Screenshot_20211214_200759.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gnknpy"&gt;My current recipe management is a hot mess: I keep too many web browser tabs opened with recipes I want to find quickly, all on my phone. With Paprika, I can download the contents of my favorite recipes (as long as they’re available online and searchable by Google) and save the ingredients and instructions inside this little app. You can even tweak the recipe you import in case you have any tips or changes you’d like to make to the original. The app includes an editable grocery shopping list, pantry list, and menu, as well as a meal planning calendar to keep your kitchen organized. Although the free version only lets you store a maximum of 50 recipes, you can upgrade to the paid version that enables syncing between devices and storage of an unlimited number of recipes for $4.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="P9mga9"&gt;Weather &amp;amp; Widget — Weawow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Weawow&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weather &amp;amp; Widget - Weawow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Weawow widget customization options" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2BRKhL_0hIItIRfxbMvQ7lc7BY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098768/Screenshot_20211215_113946.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVsKXM"&gt;Ever since IBM bought The Weather Company and, with it, Weather Underground — a site I swore by but whose app experience has seen better days — I’ve been on the hunt for a new weather app that is similarly respectful of users’ privacy. The Weawow weather app is that unicorn. It asks you to enter your location rather than demand continuous access to all your GPS data, lets you opt out of sharing your location data with third parties, and doesn’t serve ads along with its forecasts. I appreciate that this app makes it easy to change the units of measurement for those of us who need to, has a swipe-friendly interface, and lets me add it as a widget to my home screen with lots of options for customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UyiQey"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925750"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
