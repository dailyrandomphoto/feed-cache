    <title>Ingenuity’s flight on Mars is delayed again as NASA fixes a software bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zc2wUEpjY0Fxkc5LO60RMpQTxE=/97x0:1479x921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118923/Mars_Perseverance_ZR0_0050_0671377559_653ECM_N0031950ZCAM05020_034085J.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZarA9f"&gt;The first flight of NASA’s Ingenuity Mars helicopter was delayed again after running into a glitch in the rotorcraft’s flight control software during tests last week. The mini helicopter remains grounded on the surface of Mars’ Jezero Crater while it waits for engineers to tweak, test, and reinstall the software. NASA said it will come up with a new date next week for the inaugural flight test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTCjt5"&gt;Ingenuity, the four-pound helicopter that arrived on Mars on February 18th with its parent rover, Perseverance, is nine days into a monthlong test window that began when its four little legs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;touched the Martian surface&lt;/a&gt; for the first time on April 4th. The helicopter has been going through a series of tests and checkouts before flying, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368208/nasa-helicopter-mars-perseverance-ingenuity-pre-flight-test"&gt;surviving its first frigid night&lt;/a&gt; on Mars, unlocking its twin carbon fiber blades, and doing a few stationary rotor spin tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUUhQ7"&gt;The first slow-speed rotor spin at 50 rpm went well early last week, while NASA was working toward a debut flight on Sunday night. But engineers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;ran into a problem on Friday night&lt;/a&gt; when they went for the high-speed rotor test: Ingenuity’s “watchdog” software detected a bug and prevented the craft from performing the test. Ingenuity was healthy, it just couldn’t do the high-speed rotor spin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecJlp6"&gt;Over the weekend, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory decided “that minor modification and reinstallation of Ingenuity’s flight control software is the most robust path forward,” NASA said in a Monday night &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/290/work-progresses-toward-ingenuity-s-first-flight-on-mars/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Altering the software means independent engineers will have to review and test the changes before installing it back onto Ingenuity’s computer, a process that could take all week to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUTP99toDwuWuhup9Tbi8-nRfx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22440783/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0050_0671377559_653ECM_N0031950ZCAM05020_110085J.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Ingenuity is waiting on Mars for a software upgrade before it can fly.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kpE0Jp"&gt;NASA said “our best estimate of a targeted flight date is fluid right now, but we are working toward achieving these milestones and will set a flight date next week.” Engineers will come up with a new date for the high-speed test and its first flight after they send the new software through Perseverance’s communications hub and boot it to Ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJpa0u"&gt;In the meantime, NASA said Perseverance will continue doing science and prepare for a test of MOXIE, an onboard instrument that will try to produce oxygen from Mars’ carbon dioxide atmosphere. The rover’s primary mission is to search for signs of ancient life and leave pods of soil samples on the surface for a future mission to retrieve and send back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqOk21"&gt;For Ingenuity’s flight test, Perseverance will watch from a football field’s distance away using two onboard cameras. The rover also serves as a communications hub; its onboard Mars Base Station will relay signals from Ingenuity to satellites orbiting Mars, which will beam those signals back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6beDRs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The clock is ticking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GO5xy"&gt;Ingenuity is expected to carry out at least five flight tests within its 31-day test window (or 30 Mars days). For its debut flight test, the craft will ascend 10 feet above the surface and hover in place, pivot, then descend for a landing, lasting about 40 seconds altogether. Subsequent tests are expected to fly higher and travel short distances, but the exact flight details will be determined by how well the craft nails its first flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2sgKP"&gt;Ingenuity will need to exert immense power to achieve lift in Mars’ thin atmosphere. If it can do so, it’ll mark the first powered flight on another world, a historic achievement NASA is calling a “Wright brother’s moment” that could expand interplanetary mobility to where traditional wheeled rovers can’t travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u03Fuv"&gt;Ingenuity’s carbon fiber rotor blades will spin roughly 2,400 rpm during flight. For the high-speed spin test beforehand, the blades will spin at 2,537 rpm (while tilted in a certain position so it doesn’t accidentally lift off). As engineers tweak the craft’s software, the clock is ticking. NASA officials have said Ingenuity’s monthlong flight test window can’t be extended if the helicopter runs into more issues before flying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PautOF"&gt;“The is primarily a science mission for the Perseverance rover, and it needs to get on with that primary mission,” Hårvard Grip, Ingenuity’s chief pilot, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday night. “So that’s why there’s a time limit for the helicopter.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord will block NSFW servers on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uKg63rQeHQeCdq9q6mwyyfTQeHg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118838/acastro_210129_1777_discord_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uq9vCx"&gt;Discord is amping up its &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362-NSFW-Server-Designation"&gt;restrictions on adult content&lt;/a&gt;, with new age gates on NSFW servers and a ban on accessing these servers from iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecxUJS"&gt;Entire servers can now be marked as NSFW if their community “is organized around NSFW themes or if the majority of the server’s content is 18+.” This label will be a requirement going forward, and Discord will proactively mark servers as NSFW if they fail to self-identify. Discord previously allowed individual channels to be marked as NSFW and age-gated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTNdGv"&gt;The NSFW marker does two things. First, it prevents anyone under the age of 18 from joining. But the bigger limitation is that it prevents NSFW servers from being accessed on iOS devices — a significant restriction that’s almost certainly meant to cater to Apple’s strict and often prudish rules around nudity in services distributed through the App Store. Tumblr infamously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;wiped porn from its entire platform&lt;/a&gt; in order to come into compliance with Apple’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsOrc9"&gt;At least some Discord users seem to be frustrated by the changes, judging by the reaction on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SugarRollArt/status/1381975250661998592"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bergamot_latte/status/1381935558029545472"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Starwing_Wyvern/status/1381952577412141059"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that this could make them switch to Android. One said the restriction &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlexPuma/status/1381826522181435392"&gt;posed a problem for them&lt;/a&gt; since they needed to be able to monitor their server while mobile. The ban seems to be particularly concerning &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Aszabla/status/1381974218317905923"&gt;to art communities&lt;/a&gt; that include sexual illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite music streaming services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pryma-headphones-lopatto-street" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i2R-fCgyBoTiOIuTD70ahVkGo0Y=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118750/20150708-pryma-headphones--beyonce-review-liz-lopatto-1.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tyler Pena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbwpXn"&gt;No matter what you do during your waking hours — work at home or outside of it; commute in a car, a train, or by walking from your bedroom to your living room; or spend your days watching the kids or job hunting — you’re probably spending at least some of that time listening to music. But where do you find that music? And if you already have a site you go to regularly, would you like to try something new?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNGJI6"&gt;There is a wealth of streaming music services now available to anyone who wants to listen and experiment. Some offer both free and paid subscription versions. Others are completely free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y77Exj"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to tell us about their favorite music streaming services. Some listen to major outlets such as Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music, while others have discovered lesser-known but interesting venues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRXfMc"&gt;Here’s what they recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GUIs2e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://early1900s.org/radiodismuke/"&gt;Radio Dismuke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypm4U5-BKUq9FeUwCR6U_DCW-ps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433162/e1900mpbanner.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CoFwJk"&gt;For some reason, my partner and I have become addicted to the popular music of the early 20th century, mostly the 1920s and ’30s. Over the past few years, we’ve become happily familiar with the sounds of Cliff Edwards, Bessie Smith, Ruth Etting, Annette Hanshaw, Paul Whiteman, Cab Calloway, and Ethel Waters. (Here she is, in one of her sadly few motion picture appearances, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/AGNlLs0yquE"&gt;singing “Birmingham Bertha.”&lt;/a&gt;) So we spend a lot of time listening to Radio Dismuke, a little-known streaming service sponsored by &lt;a href="https://early1900s.org/"&gt;Early 1900s Music Preservation&lt;/a&gt;, which gives us a constant diet of pop and jazz from the early part of the last century. &lt;em&gt;—Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LCSpdv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XOoqPt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://somafm.com/"&gt;Soma fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXjVhrBV67Lyhk3bsi3hMQPyxNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438117/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_10.59.49_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CtcihK"&gt;Soma fm started life as an actual micropower radio station in San Francisco in 1999 but flipped over to the internet in 2000. It has been one of my go-to audio sources ever since. The site has tons of different genre stations. While working, I bounce between &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/groovesalad/"&gt;Groove Salad&lt;/a&gt; (ambient / downtempo), &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/secretagent/"&gt;Secret Agent&lt;/a&gt; (think classic Bond meets modern sensibilities), and &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/dronezone/"&gt;Drone Zone&lt;/a&gt; (very chill). In the early 2000s, &lt;a href="https://somafm.com/indiepop/"&gt;Indie Pop Rocks&lt;/a&gt; was my secret weapon for finding new bands my friends didn’t know yet. When the holidays come around, Soma’s holiday stations will make your party twice as festive and half as corny. There are apps for it on all platforms, but if you’re using &lt;a href="https://tunein.com/"&gt;TuneIn&lt;/a&gt; for terrestrial radio, Soma’s stations are listed there, too. It’s all free, but if you use it a lot, find a way to chip in a bit — after more than 20 years of streaming, Soma deserves it. &lt;em&gt;—Dieter Bohn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DVfZco"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yDTwkM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FvhgbIdej5p8zC3HBCg0Wg0E4XI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433269/Screen_Shot_2021_04_09_at_4.08.05_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir4Zp4"&gt;Most of my time on YouTube isn’t spent watching videos; it’s listening to music. YouTube Music is everything I wanted out of Google Play Music, plus some. Its catalog of music is incomparable, mostly thanks to users who upload music that otherwise isn’t available on streaming services. It has recent hits and full albums if you want to use it like, say, Spotify, but it’s my destination for listening to uploads of older music or obscure tunes, live performances, and compilations of video game soundtracks. (For some reason, I know the &lt;em&gt;Ghost Trick&lt;/em&gt; original soundtrack by heart, yet I haven’t played much of the game.) I’m always a little concerned that my favorite playlist or an upload of a hard-to-find album will be delisted, but perhaps it’s that rush that keeps me listening to it more often than any other music streaming service these days. —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vXjq46"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fNFgaW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://8tracks.com/"&gt;8tracks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnV4TxM5_mkPQBznI8uDXYjRxXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437975/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_10.16.33_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WvJdHb"&gt;I’ll confess that I don’t listen to 8tracks regularly these days, but using it is a predictable way to trigger a burst of nostalgia. The streaming service launched in 2008, and it lets users upload playlists of at least eight songs (aka 8 tracks). You can search through playlists based on their tags (which could include artists, genre, or “mood”), but you can’t see the list of songs ahead of time. They’re revealed as you listen. You also only get three skips per playlist per hour. The forced discovery helped me find songs and artists I never would have listened to. 8tracks shut down in December 2019 but was brought back to life by a new startup called BackBeat last April. All of the playlists I made in high school are still intact, but they are very embarrassing — so I’m keeping that username a secret. &lt;em&gt;—Nicole Wetsman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MjhSxT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gvHP7s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://kexp.org/"&gt;KEXP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWsNPReD6ChVD_PES5JoXsw1M38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438001/kexp_logo_official_notmutant_bw.jpg__344x459_q85_crop_subject_location_172_229_subsampling_2_upscale.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: KEXP&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="njqWRm"&gt;KEXP, a public radio station based in Seattle, is my favorite radio station in the world. It primarily plays alternative and indie rock, but there are also weekly blocks with completely different genres like blues, Latin music, songs entirely by Pacific Northwest-based artists, and my wife and I especially enjoy reggae on Saturday mornings. We regularly stream the station to our kitchen speaker while eating dinner or doing chores. The music selection is consistently excellent, and it’s also a regular reminder of the city where we met and fell in love. —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3Cth6T"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FBgjhy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.auxlive.com/browse"&gt;Aux Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GqqNQ8Z6wmaOprMpFON_-R4Lw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438023/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_10.33.17_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SKEP2u"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s resident Post Malone fan, I recently discovered Aux Live when a recording of his performance at PostyFest in 2019 was featured. My first intention was to only keep the subscription long enough to watch that one concert, but I ended up really enjoying the service. Aux Live is a music-focused service with a range of live concerts and documentaries across an expansive range of genres and legendary artists. It works both in-browser and via app. It costs $4.99 a month, but that feels reasonable given the vast number of artists featured in the service. &lt;em&gt;—Kaitlin Hatton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="C4N9DA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="25TIc9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qobuz.com%2Fus-en%2Fdiscover&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22376132%2Fmusic-streaming-services-apple-youtube-spotify" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Qobuz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qobuz&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JYumTP"&gt;After purchasing a portable DAC to listen to higher-resolution music on my phone, I was looking for a place where I can actually &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to higher-resolution music. I found Qobuz, which allows you to stream songs with up to a 192kHz sampling rate and 24-bit depth. You’re also able to buy hi-res songs or albums and download them from the Qobuz store without having to subscribe to the service. Revisiting some of my favorite albums that I listened to during my iPod days gave me a newfound appreciation for those recordings, and I ended up paying closer attention to the way they were mixed and mastered. &lt;em&gt;—Andru Marino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HWiQki"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yKnuxx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/home/"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3QsZX0f9m0qCfOPO8YrbvMS5TWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438732/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_2.18.23_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc9dla"&gt;Okay, fine — I’ll be the boring member of staff who recommends Spotify. Yes, other streaming services might offer better audio quality or curation, but Spotify has a nice user interface and compatibility with almost every piece of streaming hardware on the market, and that’s really all my basic music tastes require. And soon, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify HiFi launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;, audio quality will receive a big boost. It helps that I’ve been using Spotify for close to a decade at this point, so it has near-limitless data on me to create custom playlists tailored to my tastes. Its daily mixes are far from perfect, but they’re good enough that I regularly use them when I can’t be bothered to pick a specific band to listen to. &lt;em&gt;—Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Y83IsX"&gt;I use Apple Music for a very specific reason: because it lets me listen to music that’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on Apple Music. Let me explain. A solid 10–15 percent of the music I listen to isn’t on Spotify or any streaming service. Whether it’s something I made or one of my friends made, a rip from a long-forgotten song posted to YouTube or SoundCloud, an album that’s &lt;a href="http://www.illegal-art.net/allday/"&gt;too copyright-infringement-astic&lt;/a&gt; to be allowed on streaming services, or just &lt;a href="https://ariandherbanjo.bandcamp.com/album/collected-recordings-from-the-spring-of-2011"&gt;music that’s on Bandcamp but not streaming services&lt;/a&gt;, I still want to have a good way of syncing all of the music I like across devices — and Apple Music does a great job of that. I just drag something into the application formerly known as iTunes, and in a few moments, it shows up on my iPhone, syncs to my iPod, and can even be played through my HomePods. I’d write more about how much I love this one aspect of Apple Music, but honestly, I’m starting to sound like an annoying hipster, even to myself. &lt;em&gt;—Mitchell Clark &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ntUAd4"&gt;Did you know you can listen to over 200,000 concerts in lossless audio quality for free? And I really do mean free. The Live Music Archive, part of the Internet Archive, hosts an enormous vault of live performances from &lt;a href="https://archive.org/browse.php?collection=etree&amp;amp;field=creator"&gt;a wide range of artists&lt;/a&gt; who’ve given their blessing to have concerts traded among fans. Yes, there’s a ton of material from the Grateful Dead and jam bands in there, but the LMA also contains hundreds of recordings from acts like the Drive-By Truckers, John Mayer, Elliott Smith, Smashing Pumpkins, and more. Every so often, I’ll start digging through the archive and land on a gem I hadn’t heard before. Most are audience-recorded shows, as commercial releases (understandably) aren’t allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNjO6b"&gt;Now, the Internet Archive isn’t exactly known for intuitive navigation, and the Live Music Archive site can be very kludgy to use. Thankfully, there are apps like &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/archivist/id1180291253"&gt;this one for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.taperssection.taperssectionapp"&gt;this for Android&lt;/a&gt; that serve as easier-to-browse portals for everything inside the Live Music Archive, complete with features like offline downloads. —&lt;em&gt;Chris Welch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony invests another $200 million in Epic Games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJR1WrumvJ9d46wbqaypMbtsG5w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118602/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfjAMp"&gt;Sony has just invested another $200 million in Epic Games as part of a $1 billion funding round, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse"&gt;Epic announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Over a dozen investors contributed toward the funding round, which valued the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer at $28.7 billion. That’s over $10 billion more than Epic Games’ estimated value at the time of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318978/sony-epic-games-fortnite-investment-250-million-game-development"&gt;Sony’s major investment last July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMisTY"&gt;Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is still the company’s controlling shareholder after the  investment. In a press release, Sweeney said that Epic will use the investment to “help accelerate our work around building connected social experiences in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, while empowering game developers and creators with Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services and the Epic Games Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OlNPVC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The investment will fund Epic’s work “building connected social experiences in ‘Fortnite’, ‘Rocket League’ and ‘Fall Guys’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wzjv9a"&gt;The funding round comes less than a year after Sony’s $250 million investment in Epic. That bought it a 1.4 percent stake in the company, which &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/09/sony-invests-250-million-in-fortnite-maker-epic-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VentureBeat &lt;/em&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; valued it at $17.86 billion. In a statement released to coincide with today’s investment, Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said that the company is “excited to strengthen our collaboration to bring new entertainment experiences to people around the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqqT0M"&gt;This is just the latest sign of Sony and Epic’s close relationship. Epic has used Sony’s PS5 console to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date"&gt;show off its next-gen Unreal Engine 5 engine&lt;/a&gt;, and Sweeney said the two companies worked closely together on developing the PS5’s storage architecture. “We’ve been working super close with Sony for quite a long time on storage,” he said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tVMGY"&gt;Epic’s increase in valuation comes even as the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games"&gt;spent hundreds of millions&lt;/a&gt; on free games and exclusives for the Epic Games Store. The figure recently emerged as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;ongoing legal feud with Apple&lt;/a&gt; after the iPhone manufacturer kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off its App Store last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ThinkPad X12 Detachable is Lenovo’s latest take on the Surface Pro</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A convertible laptop for ThinkPad fans&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yrlFAz"&gt;You could line up most ThinkPad models of the past few years and the average laptop buyer might have difficulty telling the difference between them. Lenovo has the look, feel, and features of its premium business line down to a science, and it has attracted a devoted base of fans in doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R46m9P"&gt;Over the past year, Lenovo has made several attempts to move the ThinkPad package into less traditional, more portable form factors, from the razor-thin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt; to the pricey but groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;. With the ThinkPad X12 Detachable, the company is once again taking direct aim at Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt; line. As you probably figured out from its name, the X12 Detachable is a ThinkPad-branded and ThinkPad-looking 12.3-inch Windows tablet with a detachable keyboard deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaUvoV"&gt;Once you’re aware of that information, there’s not much about the X12 Detachable that will surprise you. It has many of the same strengths that its ThinkPad siblings do, including the camera shutter, the discrete clickers, the keyboard nub, and the black-and-red color scheme that ThinkPad fans will know and love. It also comes with some unique drawbacks that are inherent to its form factor — small screen, shallow keyboard, limited ports, and so on. But if you’re in the market for a detachable PC with business features and strong specs, there’s no reason the X12 Detachable shouldn’t be on your list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkqFqE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10438451"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Ui1IfO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10438471"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0KTBfc"&gt;Buying a portable, detachable machine sometimes means compromising on specs and performance, but that’s certainly not the case here. The X12 Detachable comes with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and runs Windows 10 Pro. The base model has an MSRP of $1,819 but is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x%2FX12-Detachable-G1%2Fp%2F22TPX12X2D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22376272%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; at $1,091. (This is just how Lenovo does their pricing — don’t think about it too hard.) It comes with a Core i3-1110G4, 8GB of RAM (soldered), and 256GB of storage. I’m testing a more expensive Core i5 model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, which is currently listed at $1,331.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61cdoD"&gt;The most comparable Surface Pro 7 Plus models are currently listed at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7-for-Business%2F8P43N3K93409%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-w1b%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$849.99&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7-for-Business%2F8P43N3K93409%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-w1b%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-J.XYGuY2MLU2pSLvH3NmxQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_01qr6cgcpokfqyugkk0sohzncu2xpdm1icsliwor00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Those prices are deceptive, however, because all of the X12 Detachable models currently listed on Lenovo’s site include a stylus and keyboard cover in the box; you have to buy them separately for the Surface Pro 7 Plus, and they add at least an extra $99.99 and $97.49 to the price. That means my X12 model is actually a couple hundred bucks less expensive than the most comparable Surface Pro (which also has less storage).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROrqCM"&gt;The Core i5-1130G7 in my test unit offers the various amenities of the 11th Gen line, including Intel’s powerful Xe integrated graphics and support for Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 6. Using it was a good, smooth experience: I can’t imagine that anyone using the X12 for standard business work with Chrome tabs, streaming, Zoom calls, and the like will encounter any performance issues. The ThinkPad’s fan was consistently running during my use, but it wasn’t loud enough to be bothersome, and the device never heated up.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="ThinkPad X12 Detachable kickstand from the left up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/btXqHXsJvqjuF2kL_9IgK_ukMWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439410/mchin_20190703_4517_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard attaches magnetically — it’s super easy to pop on and off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gogu7a"&gt;This isn’t a laptop you’d want to use for any kind of heavy gaming, but the Iris Xe graphics can lend a hand with lighter creative work. I used the device to process and lightly edit a batch of photos, and while it wasn’t the snappiest experience I’ve ever had, it was workable for my amateur needs. Anyone who does professional graphic work should consider a system with a GPU, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYWnkR"&gt;The X12’s keyboard and pen are both fine, and among the better accessories I’ve used with detachable PCs. The stylus, which lives in a handy loop on the right side of the keyboard deck, didn’t give me any problems and has two buttons that you can map to your taste in Lenovo’s Pen Settings software. The keys are a bit cramped and flat, as is often the case with folio keyboards, but typing was a comfortable experience overall. They’re also backlit, which you don’t see on every detachable keyboard.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SC0pMf"&gt;The touchpad is a bit small (I often hit the clickers while scrolling) and not the smoothest around, but that’s also par for the course with this sort of device. If the touchpad isn’t your thing, you can use the TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad logo on the bottom right corner of the ThinkPad X12 Detachable keyboard deck." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5HUsjlTYC5pPmxnmqwTVljKCmd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439411/mchin_20190703_4517_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a bit of a hassle to get the pen in and out of the loop, but I was never worried about losing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detachable keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fsDht69Y3TRfR9_XvQahb7lJcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439412/mchin_20190703_4517_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fn + Space toggles the backlighting. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xZ1vxl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10441919"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFyVRR"&gt;One other part of the chassis worth calling out is the 1920 x 1280 display. Like the Surface Pro line, the X12 has a 3:2 aspect ratio, which is my favorite aspect ratio (yes, I have a favorite). It’s much roomier than a traditional 16:9 display, providing noticeably more vertical space. The top and side bezels are chunky, which may put some people off, but that’s understandable since the device is also meant to function regularly as a tablet (and you need something to hold).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez6IIl"&gt;The panel itself is also quite nice. It gets decently bright, maxing out at 380 nits in my testing, which should be enough for use outdoors and in other bright settings (provided that you’re not doing creative work). It covers 73 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum, which is on par with what we’ve seen from the &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Videos and webpages all looked great, with bright colors and not too much glare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ah04Q"&gt;The X12 has a number of modern security features, which will mostly be of interest to business customers. There’s a match-on-chip fingerprint reader, which enables all enrollment, storage, and authentication to happen within the sensor itself, as well as a dTPM 2.0 chip and Lenovo’s self-healing BIOS, which Lenovo guarantees “will recover and self-heal when corrupted or maliciously attacked.” Like previous ThinkPads, the X12 also has an IR camera that supports Windows Hello facial recognition and includes a physical shutter to block it for privacy. I will note that the shutter is a bit small and difficult to swap back and forth, even with my tiny fingers. (There’s also no shutter for the rear-facing camera.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detachable seen from the back, angled to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sj0Wty3ALriBT_MvpIXN0RsGx-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22439413/mchin_20190703_4517_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The kickstand is quite sturdy and doesn’t slide at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1yIEa"&gt;One area where Lenovo is lagging behind Microsoft is upgradeability. The Surface Pro 7 Plus comes with a removable SSD that’s easy to access. The X12’s SSD is very difficult to get at, and doing so would likely void its warranty, per analysis from the experts at &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This likely will not be a deciding factor for most consumers but could be an important consideration for some business users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnCrr5"&gt;The X12 Detachable has a fairly small 42Wh battery. So I was pleasantly surprised to see how long it lasted — especially since the X1 Fold, the last ThinkPad-branded tablet I reviewed, averaged under five hours to a charge. With the screen around 200 nits of brightness, using the X12 as my daily driver for Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, Zoom calls, and the like, I averaged around seven hours and 50 minutes to a charge. This is right around what my colleague Tom Warren got out of the Surface Pro 7 Plus, and it means you’ll get close to a full day out of the X12 if your workload is similar to mine.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awNGKR"&gt;I think Lenovo’s done what it set out to do with the ThinkPad X12 Detachable. The device makes a clear case for itself as a system with the performance, build quality, and business features of a ThinkPad in a uniquely portable and versatile form factor. Its areas of weakness aren’t disasters, and they’re not areas where other detachables do much better. And it comes with some unique benefits, including Lenovo’s suite of business features and the bundled keyboard and stylus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XfyjAR"&gt;When comparing the X12 to the Surface Pro 7 Plus, the latter factor is what really seals the deal for me. The merits of the two laptops’ respective enterprise features and upgradability benefits will likely vary between companies. But for a consumer like me, the fact that the accessories you need are bundled into the X12’s price makes it a significantly better deal than its Microsoft competitor without too many drawbacks. And if you’re a ThinkPad fan who’s been hoping for a capable detachable with all your favorite features, your wish has certainly come true. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This 5TB Western Digital hard drive will store a lot of PS5 games for $100</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nllXU6"&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381494/sony-ps5-april-update-games-external-usb-storage-social-features"&gt;an update to the PS5 will allow you to store&lt;/a&gt; — but not play — next-gen games on a portable USB hard drive. Previously, the console only let you store and play PS4 games from external storage. If you’re someone who doesn’t want to keep re-downloading huge PS5 games (especially if you have an internet data cap), but instead would rather just plug in a drive and transfer them locally, there are a couple of hard drive deals worth checking out today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5ba7D"&gt;At Newegg, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmodel-wdba3a0050bbk-wesn-5tb%2Fp%2FN82E16822234385" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Western Digital’s 5TB Black hard drive&lt;/a&gt; is $100 when you put in the offer code &lt;strong&gt;93XQU39 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. It’s normally $150. This model won’t be nearly as fast at transferring files as an SSD, but if having a massive amount of storage trumps speed, this should be a good fit for the PS5, as well as the Xbox Series X / S consoles, or for PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5TTNoy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10443810"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="foKzT9"&gt;For something a little smaller, both in terms of physical size and storage capacity, check out Western Digital’s 2TB Easystore hard drive. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737656464037927504#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $57 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is almost half off its original price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XW0DSe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9511198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Op7I1y"&gt;It’s been a few days since I gushed about how good this $100 off deal is on LG’s UltraGear QHD gaming monitor. You can still get this 27-inch IPS monitor with G-Sync compatibility, a 144Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time for $297 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLD2QXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F13%2F22381530%2Fwestern-digital-hard-drive-ps5-games-xbox-lg-gaming-monitor-mothers-day-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Nintendo is releasing a bright blue Switch Lite in May</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61plYWxVNUjoT6PkEo4AoRWoe58=/0x175:2149x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118257/Ey2xDXCWgAEIka8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="phRsD8"&gt;Nintendo has announced a new color for its portable-only Switch Lite. The new hue is “blue,” which looks &lt;em&gt;pretty close&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://media.gamestop.com/i/gamestop/10134015/Nintendo-Game-Boy-Pocket-Blue?%24zoom%24"&gt;Game Boy’s “pocket blue”&lt;/a&gt; color variant. The new color could also be inspired by Pantone’s decision to name “classic blue” the &lt;a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/pantone-color-of-the-year-2020"&gt;Color of the Year for 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgA90N"&gt;Blue joins the other four variants available in the Switch Lite lineup: gray, turquoise, yellow, and coral, the latter of which was the first color announced in the product’s release since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite debuted in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the regular Nintendo Switch, which is a hybrid console that can be played on the go or docked and paired with a larger screen, the Switch Lite is designed for handheld-only gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JV9Qxz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10443883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PjYU1V"&gt;The blue Switch Lite will be available on May 21st, the same day as Nintendo’s upcoming adventure game &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/17/22288101/miitopia-nintendo-switch-direct-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miitopia&lt;/em&gt; launches on the Switch&lt;/a&gt;. And just like the other four colors in the Switch Lite portfolio, the blue Switch Lite will be priced at $199.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Zero Dawn’s Aloy is coming to Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Go0Qi2P_7K9KRqbrQxtfUh8EQ9Q=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118221/Ey2xMmAWEAEiOCA.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pXE3ll"&gt;Aloy, star of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14665114/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4"&gt;Sony’s 2017 open-world hit &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/13/aloy-arrives-in-fortnite-as-the-latest-member-of-the-gaming-legends-series/"&gt;soon be dropping&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s battle royale island. The character will be available in the game’s item shop starting on April 15th, with a bundle that includes cosmetics like a Glinthawk glider. Given that &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; takes place in a world that’s both sci-fi and prehistoric, Aloy should feel right at home in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current “Primal” season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r7mxEk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"No brand is safe from Fortnite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0s44G"&gt;She also joins an increasingly large lineup of licensed characters in Epic’s battle royale, which includes other notable gaming characters like Master Chief, Kratos, and — most recently — Lara Croft. In fact, after Aloy is available, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will be getting a limited time duos mode focused on the stars of &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. “At your disposal will only be the bow for Aloy and dual pistols for Lara — keep an eye out for wildlife and master your crafting skills to upgrade your weapons,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/04/13/aloy-arrives-in-fortnite-as-the-latest-member-of-the-gaming-legends-series/"&gt;Sony wrote in a blog post announcing the mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4q8dz"&gt;Outside of new characters, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; also got a notable update today introducing off-road tires so you can drive across more of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is poisoning its reputation with AI researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzxx5673Rjngs3acpS-QRdbUqhQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69118192/acastro_210412_4523_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The firing of top Google AI ethics researchers has created a significant backlash&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XHnZUS"&gt;Google has worked for years to position itself as a responsible steward of AI. Its research lab hires respected academics, publishes groundbreaking papers, and steers the agenda at the field’s biggest conferences. But now its reputation has been badly, perhaps irreversibly damaged, just as the company is struggling to put a politically palatable face on its empire of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7S3ykJ"&gt;The company’s decision to fire Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell — two of its top AI ethics researchers, who happened to be examining the downsides of technology integral to Google’s search products — has triggered waves of protest. Academics have registered their discontent in various ways. Two &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/departures-2-google-ai-researchers-spur-fallout/"&gt;backed out&lt;/a&gt; of a Google research workshop, a third &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/24/tech/google-ai-ethics-reputation"&gt;turned down&lt;/a&gt; a $60,000 grant from the company, and a fourth &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vj_chidambaram/status/1370449088400011272?s=20"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; not to accept its funding in the future. Two engineers quit the company in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/04/google-timnit-gebru-ai-engineers-quit"&gt;protest of Gebru’s treatment&lt;/a&gt; and just last week, one of Google’s top AI employees, a research manager named Samy Bengio who oversaw hundreds of workers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370372/google-research-manager-resigns-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt;. (Bengio did not mention the firings in an email announcing his resignation but earlier said he was “&lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&amp;amp;id=100002932057665&amp;amp;comment_id=3470470943060607&amp;amp;notif_t=mentions_comment&amp;amp;notif_id=1607192244022022&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;stunned&lt;/a&gt;” by what happened to Gebru.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UEkken"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It worries me that they’ve shown a willingness to suppress science”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p19jNt"&gt;“Not only does it make me deeply question the commitment to ethics and diversity inside the company,” Scott Niekum, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who works on robotics and machine learning, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “But it worries me that they’ve shown a willingness to suppress science that doesn’t align with their business interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fesSsw"&gt;“It definitely hurts their credibility in the fairness and AI ethics space,” says Deb Raji, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation who works on AI accountability. “I don’t think the machine learning community has been very open about conflicts of interest due to industry participation in research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIUPIG"&gt;Niekum and Raji, along with many others inside and outside of Google, were shocked by what happened to Gebru and Mitchell, co-leads of the company’s Ethical AI team. Gebru was fired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; after arguments with managers over a research paper she co-authored with Mitchell and others. (Google disputes this account and &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Gebru resigned.) Mitchell was fired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; after searching her email for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. The paper in question &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155985/paper-timnit-gebru-fired-google-large-language-models-search-ai"&gt;examined problems&lt;/a&gt; in large-scale AI language models — technology that now underpins Google’s lucrative search business — and the firings have led to protest as well as accusations that the company is suppressing research. After Gebru was ousted in December, a &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; declaring solidarity with her and criticizing “unprecedented research censorship” by Google was signed by nearly 2,700 employees and more than 4,300 “academic, industry, and civil society supporters.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CD6SgN"&gt;It’s likely there will be more protest and more resignations, too. After Bengio left the company, Mitchell &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1379514157364510723"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “Resignations coming now bc people started interviewing soon after we were fired,” and that “job offers are just starting now; more resignations are likely.” When asked for comment on these and other issues highlighted in this piece, Google offered only boilerplate responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NwCIiD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHAKEN CONFIDENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="QXOQUE"&gt;One of the employees who &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-resignations-idUSKBN2A4090"&gt;quit the company&lt;/a&gt; in protest earlier this year was David Baker. He started work at Google in 2004 and when he resigned in February, he was director of its Trust &amp;amp; Safety Engineering group. He tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Google’s treatment of Gebru (he left before Mitchell was fired) has seriously shaken his confidence in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6MgGP"&gt;“I was just blindsided to see and hear what happened to Timnit,” Baker told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It broke my heart.” He adds that he didn’t take the decision to resign lightly: he loved his job and refers to his last couple of years at the company as “the happiest days of my life.” But quitting was the least he could do to stand in solidarity with Gebru, he says. “I spent a couple of weeks thinking and talking with my wife and ultimately decided I just couldn’t bring myself to go back to work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya8HMS"&gt;Baker is just one individual who feels let down by Google, but his response shows how the company has damaged its standing even with senior employees. The Trust &amp;amp; Safety team that Baker oversaw works on a range of important safety problems in Google, from tackling spam on Gmail to removing scams from the company’s advertising platform. “We’re behind the scenes on a whole bunch of applications,” as Baker puts it. He adds that although he didn’t work with Gebru or Mitchell personally, members of his team did, learning from them as part of what he calls the “emerging discipline” of AI safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="B4IZ23"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google’s failure in diversity will lead to blindspots in its research”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zEYCa5"&gt;AI safety will grow ever more important to Google as the company integrates machine learning methods ever deeper within its products. Probing the limitations of these systems — not just from a technical perspective but also a social one — was at the heart of Gebru and Mitchell’s work. And while it’s in Google’s interests to find weaknesses in its own technology, it seems the company didn’t want to hear everything its employees had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2Fc6K"&gt;Baker says that although he was always reassured by Google’s integrity within the Trust &amp;amp; Safety group (“We were very focused on what was right for the user, it was not about what was best for the brand”) the treatment of Gebru has made him doubt whether the company is always able to live up to its best intentions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44CwtK"&gt;“I think it definitely calls into question whether Google can be trusted to honestly question the ethical applications of its technology,” says Baker. “And Google’s failure in diversity will lead to blindspots in its research. The reality is that Google is not a place where folks from all backgrounds can thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="HHUWpZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPRESSING SCIENCE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="D07U1x"&gt;Researchers and academics &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to for this story highlighted two distinct but connected concerns with Google’s behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwcIQM"&gt;The first is the treatment of Gebru and Mitchell as individuals and what that says about the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion as an employer. Google has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/04/google-hbcu-recruiting/"&gt;well-documented problems&lt;/a&gt; with hiring and retaining minority talent, and this is another example of its failures. The second touches on broader questions about the trustworthiness of the company’s AI research and whether the company can fairly examine the potential harms of its technology. In the case of Gebru and Mitchell’s work, that means the damage posed by large-scale language models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuxL9T"&gt;All those interviewed for this story stressed that they didn’t doubt the integrity of individual Google researchers, but were worried that the company’s internal structures — including its review process of papers — were subtly warping their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrYSXJ"&gt;“I trust that things they are publishing are correct but I don’t trust that they’re not censored,” Hadas Kress-Gazit, a professor of robotics at Cornell who boycotted a Google workshop along with Scott, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’ll be the truth but not the whole truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6e5r6M"&gt;One of the ways Google’s research is shaped to fit corporate interests is through the company’s internal review process. Last December, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research-focus-idUSKBN28X1CB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google had created a new level of review for “sensitive topics” in 2020. If researchers are writing about topics like sentiment analysis, facial recognition, the categorization of gender, race, or politics, they have to consult with Google’s PR team and legal advisors who will look over their work and suggest changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIjth3"&gt;Internal correspondence cited by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; includes feedback in which a senior Google manager told a paper’s author to “take great care to strike a positive tone.” Another paper was edited to remove all references to Google’s products, and another to remove mentions of legal risks associated with new research — including risks to users’ personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SimsMe"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google said: “Our research review process engages a wide range of subject matter experts from across the Research org and Google overall, including social scientists, ethicists, policy and privacy advisors, and human rights specialists, and has helped improve many of our publications and research applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CyrgQ5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’re getting into a serious problem of censorship.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FudSpE"&gt;But as Mitchell told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; last year (when she was still employed by Google): “If we are researching the appropriate thing given our expertise, and we are not permitted to publish that on grounds that are not in line with high-quality peer review, then we’re getting into a serious problem of censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keUXOU"&gt;Mitchell’s worries are substantiated by the nature of the paper that led to her and Gebru’s departure. Far from offering a controversial or unexpected appraisal, the research gave a comprehensive overview of existing critiques. One marker of this (and of the research’s thoroughness) is that the paper cited 128 previous publications in its original form — more than &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1335500451530170368?lang=en"&gt;six times the average&lt;/a&gt; for papers published at AI conference NeurIPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6fDwD"&gt;The paper says that, like many algorithms, AI language models have a tendency to regurgitate “both subtle biases and overtly abusive language patterns” found in training data, and that because of the amount of computing power needed to create these models they come with environmental costs. These are not controversial observations, and even critiques of the paper have praised its general arguments. One widely shared evaluation of a finished version of the paper by computer scientist Yoav Goldberg &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/yoavg/9fc9be2f98b47c189a513573d902fb27"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that it “takes one-sided political views” and is overly focused on questions of scale, but adds: “I also agree with and endorse most of the content. This is important stuff, you should read it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b6KCN"&gt;This makes Google’s objections to the paper unusual. The company’s head of AI, Jeff Dean, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the paper “didn’t meet our bar for publication” and “ignored too much relevant research” about how the problems it highlighted might be mitigated. But for many, including employees at Google, these objections rang false. As one researcher at Google Brain Montreal, Nicolas Le Roux, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/le_roux_nicolas/status/1334601960972906496"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter: “My submissions were always checked for disclosure of sensitive material, never for the quality of the literature review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XVOC63"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Black and female researchers have made some of the most powerful critiques of AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7IZOz"&gt;Connected to Google’s treatment of the paper itself is the treatment of Gebru as an individual, and what that says about the company’s attitude toward Black and women researchers. “In environments where these people are dismissed, devalued, or discriminated against, their work — these valid critiques of the field — is discredited and dismissed, too,” says Raji. “Minoritized voices have a harder time vocalizing these critiques even though they’re some of the most important contributions to the space.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QASMY"&gt;This dynamic is not new. Raji gives the example of a 2018 paper called &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212"&gt;Gender Shades&lt;/a&gt; by researcher Joy Buolamwini — a paper now recognized as a landmark critique of gender and racial bias in facial recognition. “Famously, the paper almost didn’t get presented at conference because it was dismissed as too simple,” says Raji. After it was published, Gender Shades had a huge effect on the industry and society at large. It sparked political debates about the utility of facial recognition, prompting companies like Microsoft to reevaluate the accuracy of their technology, and others, like IBM, to drop it altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CecOC"&gt;In other words: it significantly changed the political landscape and the priorities of big tech firms. This is the power and impact that the right paper at the right time can have, and for many people this explains why Google was so keen to shut down Gebru’s criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spl309"&gt;As Raji notes, much of this important work is done by groups who are not treated well by tech firms. She says this dynamic — dismissal of the individual leading to dismissal of their work — was at play with Google’s treatment of Gebru. “It was really easy for them to fire her because they didn’t value the work she was doing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E6nods"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TURNING AWAY FROM TECH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="m3zOAS"&gt;Despite the anger and sadness articulated by many researchers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to, others were more ambivalent about recent incidents. They said it would not affect their willingness to work with Google in future, and noted that interference in research was the price of working in industry labs. Many said they thought the only lasting solution to this problem was better public funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNu7L3"&gt;One AI professor at an American university who’s previously received money from Google to fund research and wished to be anonymous, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he could understand why people wanted to protest the company but said that finding funding in academia would always force researchers to turn to potentially compromising sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yg9PAw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Industry labs will always be swayed by corporate interests, say many researchers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RrtyFT"&gt;“I cannot really define a coherent moral or ethical position that says it is okay to accept money from the Department of Defense but not from Google,” said the professor by email. “Put another way: how can you accept (or avert your gaze from) the atrocities that the DoD commits (across the world and also in terms of HR matters involving its own people), but draw the line at the current case with Google?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNCDBG"&gt;Another researcher, who also wished to be anonymous, noted that working in corporate labs would always come with trade-offs between academic freedom and other perks. They said that Google was not alone in treating research staff callously and pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/11631044/microsoft-shuts-down-silicon-valley-research-lab-amid-broader-layoffs"&gt;Microsoft’s sudden decision in 2014&lt;/a&gt; to shut down an entire Silicon Valley lab, firing more than 50 leading computer scientists with little warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oceZaD"&gt;By some measures, though, Google is a special case and wields outsize influence in the field of AI in a way that other companies have not in the past. Firstly, Google happens to have in abundance the two resources that have powered AI’s ascendance in recent years: abundant computing power and data. Secondly, the company has stated time and time again that AI is crucial to future profitability. This means it’s directly invested in the field in a way that doesn’t compare to its funding of, say, computational neuroscience. It’s this combination of self-interest and technological advantage that gives it the ability and motivation to direct, to some degree, the parameters of academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0xcmE"&gt;“They have this massive influence because of the combination of money they’re putting into research, [the] media influence they wield, and their enormous presence in terms of papers published and reviewers in the system,” says Niekum. He adds, though, that this criticism could be applied to other big tech companies just easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAG4cZ"&gt;Whatever the context of Google’s involvement in AI research, it’s clear that the company has hurt its reputation significantly with its treatment of Gebru and Mitchell. Calculating what effect incidents like these will have on a company in the long run is impossible, but in the short term Google has eroded trust in its AI work and its ability to support minority voices. Accusations of self-censorship will also undermine claims that it can regulate its own technology. If Google can’t be trusted to examine the shortcomings of its own AI tools, does the government need to take a closer look at their workings? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u83s1A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google needs to do much more to win back many researchers’ trust&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iZ6Anu"&gt;All the same, those boycotting Google workshops and refusing its money know that their actions are more symbolic than anything else. “Compared to the number of people who are collaborating with Google and the number of academics who have part time appointments at Google, it’s a drop in the ocean,” says Kress-Gazit. They’re still determined, though, to press the issue in the hope that Google will make amends. Since the firing of Gebru and Mitchell, the company has appointed a new employee, Marian Croak, to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/"&gt;oversee its Responsible AI initiatives&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html"&gt;tweaked&lt;/a&gt; its review process for papers (but offered no details about what has changed or why). For those angry with the firm, it needs to do much more, including offering real transparency for reviews and apologizing publicly to Gebru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfWCOQ"&gt;And for others, it’s too late altogether. Raji, who is close to Gebru, says that as a result of watching how Google treated her friend over last few months, she’s changed her mind about going to work in industry and decided to pursue a career in academia instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZZzey"&gt;“Before this, I had a lot more faith in what could happen with industry research on these AI ethics issues,” she says. “This whole situation shows that within industry there’s a lot of cultural dynamics still at play and you’re still beholden to leadership caring about these issues. As a minority woman, you’re going to be disadvantaged and disrespected in certain ways. And I’m just not ready for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z9tGfU"&gt;That’s one talented researcher the tech industry has lost. It won’t be the last. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6vOsQP"&gt;Amazon is now allowing Xbox owners to download Xbox Game Pass games using Alexa. The feature doesn’t require Alexa users to immediately install a skill, and it can be evoked by saying “Alexa, download [game] from Xbox Game Pass.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVDvYi"&gt;If you’ve already linked Alexa to your Xbox, then the digital assistant will find the game and install it to the linked Xbox automatically. You can also ask Alexa what’s new or popular on Xbox Game Pass and even find out what’s leaving the service soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTekLo"&gt;If you haven’t already linked Alexa to an Xbox, then you’ll be prompted to set up the link when you attempt to download a game with your voice for the first time. This will require the Xbox skill to be installed through the Alexa app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="022T49"&gt;Microsoft is Amazon’s first gaming partner to launch this new Alexa direct-download feature, and it arrives just weeks after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313052/amazon-alexa-app-xbox-new-visual-features"&gt;new Alexa app debuted on Xbox&lt;/a&gt;. The Alexa app on Xbox lets you display emails, the weather, and other visual content, alongside using the digital assistant for voice commands to launch Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBMZ8i"&gt;This new Alexa direct-download option for Xbox Game Pass subscribers will be available to US users today, with additional markets planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
