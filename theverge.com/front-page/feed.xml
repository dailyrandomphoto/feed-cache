    <title>Reddit’s lead GameStop hypebeast is being sued for his role in the stock surge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TdcYQ8Q9CYZsga1_oEP4d0KZ1Ms=/0x0:1788x1192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832476/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_9.35.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roaring Kitty/Keith Patrick Gill&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSGCNJ"&gt;“Roaring Kitty,” also known as u/DeepFuckingValue on Reddit and Keith Patrick Gill in real life, is now the target of a lawsuit (which you can view below) that claims he manipulated the market to increase GameStop’s stock price. The lawsuit claims that he created a “fake persona” of an investment newbie, while actually having several financial certifications and working for an insurance company (which is also named as a defendant, with the case citing “failure to supervise”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6h2fWB"&gt;Gill is well-known on the WallStreetBets subreddit, where he’s been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/"&gt;posting for a year&lt;/a&gt; about GameStop’s stock, its value, and how much he has invested. He would also post &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAGEeYpAto4"&gt;hours-long videos on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; discussing the stock and why he thought it was undervalued. The videos are absolutely packed with financial jargon and discussion about GameStop’s business model and position in the market. He was even &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696"&gt;profiled by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the stock began to soar, which reported that he was set to make tens of millions of dollars from his investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6kDsF"&gt;But the legal complaint claims that Gill’s 10 years in the finance and investment industries, along with the financial licenses and qualifications he has, don’t square with the “amateur, everyday fellow” persona he put out on his YouTube channel, Reddit account, and Twitter — and that he used that persona to illegally manipulate the market by posting about it to his “legion of fans.” Lawyers argue that his financial certifications also made it illegal for him to share claims about stocks that he knows are “false or misleading,” which the plaintiff claims he did. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_sEBUna9aIN1KA3wdMmxErRZhQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310190/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_10.11.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The list of securities licenses and qualifications the suit claims Gill has. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vuO5gO"&gt;The complaint also tries to paint Gill as something of a mastermind, claiming he personally “incited a market frenzy” on Reddit and “actively recruited traders” on YouTube and Twitter as part of a plan to profit while damaging others’ finances in the process. The plaintiff claims they lost money in the case after the stock’s value shot up, allegedly due to Gill’s manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHm5tJ"&gt;Even the plain clothing he wore in videos was part of Gill’s scheme to defraud, lawyers suggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VNa8K2"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20485494-02-16-21-gamestop-complaint/?embed=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="02-16-21-gamestop-complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uerzq"&gt;Gill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22281698/ceo-reddit-robinhood-roaring-kitty-testify-gamestop-hearing-congress-stocks"&gt;is slated to speak at a congressional hearing about GameStop trading on February 18th&lt;/a&gt;, along with the CEOs of Reddit and Robinhood. The hearing aims to determine if there was market manipulation involved in the rapid rise and fall of the GME stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlEarh"&gt;The plaintiff in the case hopes to turn it into a class action suit, and the law firm behind it, Hagens Berman, &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/gme"&gt;has set up a page&lt;/a&gt; for investors to send in their complaints. The firm has had success with class actions in the past; it’s won notable settlements from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/21/11991526/apple-ebook-price-fixing-refunds-begin-for-consumers"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/visa-mastercard-atm"&gt;Visa-Mastercard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/volkswagenaudi-emissions"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skittish is a virtual event space built from the lessons of the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XLAXtX3Tw5u4Z61QF2VqvTXeOss=/205x0:1716x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832451/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_9.19.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Andy Baio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pSOLN"&gt;XOXO Festival co-founder Andy Baio &lt;a href="https://waxy.org/2021/02/announcing-skittish/"&gt;unveiled his newest project on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;: a new platform for virtual events called &lt;a href="https://skittish.com/"&gt;Skittish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgJ1eI"&gt;Skittish looks like a very cute version of social spaces in video games like &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;VRChat&lt;/em&gt; but built specifically to host online events.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;You attend events as an adorable animal avatar, and explore the worlds created for you by clicking around with your mouse or navigating with the WASD keys on your keyboard like you might in a video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MckEsg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a little tour of our work in progress. Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonghales?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@simonghales&lt;/a&gt; for all his incredibly hard work, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikebodge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mikebodge&lt;/a&gt; for laying the groundwork, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cyberdees?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@cyberdees&lt;/a&gt; for encouraging me to apply to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GrantForTheWeb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GrantForTheWeb&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AOdzNvCeha"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AOdzNvCeha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Baio (@waxpancake) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1361752495400259584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zLyxup"&gt;As you explore a Skittish world, you’ll be able to catch snippets of conversations or overhear something exciting going on thanks to spatial audio, which makes sounds fade in and out depending on how near you are to the source. (If you’ve played a game with &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/friday-the-13th-sea-of-thieves-and-how-proximity-chat-continues-to-be-online-gamings-most-exciting-evolution-in-years/"&gt;proximity-based voice chat&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a similar concept.) If you hear something interesting, you can mosey over to it to learn more, like you might at an in-person event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzRmBS"&gt;And if you’re the one organizing an event on Skittish, the platform is designed to give you lots of tools to craft a space that’s tailored to your needs. Baio showed me an early version of Skittish, and it was simple to place not just environmental objects like rocks and trees, but also entire screens playing YouTube videos and even portals to new areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PKRlr"&gt;Baio also sees an opportunity for Skittish to be used by creators to host things like private meetups for supporters or as a place to debut a new YouTube video or a song. And I could totally see it — with how flexible the Skittish spaces seem even at this early stage, I think there’s a lot of possibility for people to use them in creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lLy3jE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The project was inspired by Baio’s time attending virtual events during the pandemic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7v6Hyy"&gt;The project was inspired by Baio’s time attending virtual events during the pandemic — many of which weren’t all that great, by his estimation. “A lot of them didn’t feel like events to me,” Baio said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They weren’t social in any meaningful way.” Some felt like “sort of like watching a YouTube video with a chat room,” while others had elements like breakout rooms that were intended to recreate a social experience that just weren’t the same as an in-person event. (And Baio &lt;a href="https://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2019/09/12/seven-years-of-good-luck-at-the-xoxo-festival/"&gt;knows how to pull off good events&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVZzWB"&gt;But Baio still did see good event virtual spaces, like 2020’s &lt;a href="https://roguelike.club/event2020.html"&gt;Rougelike Celebration&lt;/a&gt;, which had a custom-built social space that &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lazerwalker/using-game-design-to-make-virtual-events-more-social-24o"&gt;resembled an old-school text-based adventure game&lt;/a&gt;, and LikeLike’s experimental online video game exhibitions, which include a “&lt;a href="https://likelike3d.herokuapp.com/#"&gt;First Person Soother&lt;/a&gt;” and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209548/likelike-online-experimental-art-games-gallery-itsy-bitsy-crisis"&gt;pixelated gallery space / MMO&lt;/a&gt;. Baio also spoke highly of some of the hit games of the pandemic, such as &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, which he played “like every day for months and months.” Those events, games, and the idea of using proximity chat all provided inspiration for what would eventually become Skittish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2nk3d"&gt;Baio tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he plans to add things like text chat, moderation tools, and more customization options to Skittish. He plans to charge for the service and may offer a limited free tier at some point, but there are financial costs and concerns about moderation to consider with a free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URkdEk"&gt;“You can’t just ignore the potential problematic uses of social spaces,” Baio says. “You can’t just say, ‘we’ll just open it up to everybody and we’ll just see what happens.’ You have to be cognizant of the potential misuse, abuse, and harm that could be done when creating a social platform. Having an unlimited free tier without having the moderation resources to understand how it was being used would be irresponsible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgMcfq"&gt;The project is still early, with no set timeline for when it might be available to more people. But if you want to help with beta testing, or just want to keep up to date on the project, there’s a &lt;a href="https://skittish.com/"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; you can sign up for now.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zillow’s 3D Home app can now use AI to guess the size of your house</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esVcWiVQB8sYOAnQtPrNebH3gLo=/39x137:2669x1890/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832426/Zillow3DHomeTour.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d6Wrxl"&gt;Zillow’s 3D Home app can now generate home floor plans based on scans a user uploads, &lt;a href="http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2021-02-17-Zillow-Launches-Next-Generation-3D-Tours#assets_28775_137692-135:22124"&gt;the company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature, powered by the company’s artificial intelligence technology, is available today in the Zillow 3D Home app and could prove useful for people looking to relocate during the pandemic — or just anyone fantasizing about living in a mansion in Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSX17c"&gt;Zillow 3D Home &lt;a href="http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2019-04-22-Zillow-Launches-AI-Powered-3D-Home-Tours-Across-United-States-and-Canada"&gt;was originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as a way to offer customers a more immersive way to view listings on its site and real estate agents and property managers an easier way to create them. Using a phone or a 360° camera and the Zillow 3D Home app, you can upload a series of photographs that the app can stitch into a 3D tour. It’s not quite the same as wandering through an open house, but it could tell you more about a space than photo or video tours can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AEwNcQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zillow can generate a floor plan of your house based off photos you upload&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RwLV53"&gt;The new AI-generated floor plans add another layer of information to that equation. Anyone viewing a listing on Zillow’s site or app with a 3D Home tour and floor plan available can click on a specific room in the floor plan to jump to that part of the tour. Zillow says the floor plans can be uploaded for use in industry-standard sites like an MLS (multiple listing service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFIRgk"&gt;Beyond just generating a map of your home, Zillow also says the AI can predict the dimensions and square footage of rooms based on the photos you upload. It’s hard to say without testing just how accurate the AI is at guessing these measurements, but with the feature available now in 25 markets, with more coming over the course of the year, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to try for yourself soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbUP71"&gt;Expanding 3D Home’s features makes sense for people looking to relocate during the pandemic without the ability to necessarily view a home safely, but it could also speak to Zillow’s awareness of its use as a source of entertainment for millions of people stuck at home. The whole idea is captured pretty succinctly in a recent Saturday Night Live skit featuring actor and writer Dan Levy, focused on using Zillow to “spice up” people’s love lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7jGl1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEfsaXDX0UQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg0Ksg"&gt;Zillow knows it’s used for escapism, Zillow CEO Rich Barton admitted as much in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/zillow-hopes-to-turn-real-estate-porn-users-during-covid-into-actual-sales.html"&gt;a CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;interview where he acknowledge the skit&lt;/a&gt;. Capturing people who enjoy “Zillow Surfing,” as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/zillow-hopes-to-turn-real-estate-porn-users-during-covid-into-actual-sales.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ Taylor Lorenz explored&lt;/a&gt;, could be improved by making Zillow more engaging, and piling on different ways to “experience” homes is a good way to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcFoUm"&gt;Whether those people ever get funneled into buying or renting a home is a whole other problem, but if Zillow remains popular, there’s a good chance they’ll head there first when they’re ready to move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y843IJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTocYm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFhPf5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(The new MagSafe cases will replace the older models once stock runs out, the company says.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8zSAyq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KxylumIPCk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wpQ4I"&gt;But the Nomad cases are more solidly put together than Apple’s own offerings. As the “rugged” in the name suggests, the Nomad models feature a plastic shell and rubber frame that promises to protect the phone against drops from up to 10 feet. That protection does come at a cost, though: only the back of the case is actually covered with leather (which is the same Horween leather that Nomad uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176171/nomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on"&gt;on its other products&lt;/a&gt;). In 2017, my colleague Dan Seifert said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16744278/apple-iphone-x-leather-case"&gt;iPhone X version of the case&lt;/a&gt; “feels more like a leather skin on top of a rubber case than a full leather experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uzFO6"&gt;The standard Rugged Leather case is available in three colors: black, brown, and natural leather, while the Rugged Folio case comes in black and brown. Both models are available to order today from Nomad’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MWC insists on holding potential COVID-19 superspreader event in Barcelona</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the GSMA Mobile World Congress (..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vt7EutlzRxvzaUmZLtwa3pA947E=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832175/1201569982.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XIe35g"&gt;The world’s largest phone show, Mobile World Congress, is moving forward with an in-person event in June, despite the risks that it could turn into a COVID-19 superspreader event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlRJ0O"&gt;Over 100,000 people usually attend MWC. John Hoffman, the CEO of the GSM Association (which organizes the show) says those numbers will be scaled back this year. He &lt;a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/blog-mwc-shanghai-to-provide-china-5g-showcase-barcelona-blueprint/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Mobile World Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he’s expecting around 50,000 people will travel to Barcelona, interact with each other and locals, and then fly back home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrxPq1"&gt;The event’s &lt;a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/attend/safety-security"&gt;safety and security page says&lt;/a&gt; organizers will be “controlling crowd density” and requiring masks. Hoffman said he &lt;a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/blog/blog-mwc-shanghai-to-provide-china-5g-showcase-barcelona-blueprint/"&gt;wouldn’t expect&lt;/a&gt; everyone in attendance to be vaccinated against COVID-19. “Our view is it would be great if the world was vaccinated, but we can’t rely on that in 2021,” he told &lt;em&gt;Mobile World Live&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfWpnX"&gt;Instead, the group is asking that everyone in attendance have a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of their arrival. Testing is not a sufficient way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, particularly when tests are done that far in advance. Someone could very easily test negative, contract the virus en route to MWC, and spread the disease when they arrive. XPrize founder Peter Diamandis relied on testing to hold an &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/13/1018374/peter-diamandis-covid-superspreader-a360-conference/"&gt;in-person conference&lt;/a&gt; in California with under 100 people in January — but there was no quarantine requirement, and mask-wearing wasn’t enforced. Dozens of people tested positive for the virus afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhJMhT"&gt;Big meetings and events, especially when they’re connected with international travel, can be breeding grounds for coronavirus infections. Hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 cases were tied back to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/world/superspreading-boston-biotech-conference-in-february-is-linked-to-1-9-percent-of-all-us-cases.html"&gt;biotech conference in Boston&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the pandemic, for example. Holding a large event places not only the attendees at risk, but also the people who live in the region where the event takes place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyPsGb"&gt;The GSM Association &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;fought against canceling&lt;/a&gt; its 2020 show, which was set to take place last February just as COVID-19 was emerging as a worldwide problem. It took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;major brands&lt;/a&gt; like LG, ZTE, Sony, and Amazon pulling out for the group to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;shut down the event&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbCmHn"&gt;COVID-19 is still a major threat worldwide. Spain is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-cases.html"&gt;currently averaging&lt;/a&gt; around 12,000 new cases and 400 deaths per day. While the situation may improve by June, people around the world will still be vulnerable to the disease. The vaccine rollout in Spain is slow, with only around &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;65,000 doses&lt;/a&gt; given per day. Most of the population will still be unvaccinated come summer if that pace continues. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new kind of Verge Live event is coming March 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6EFIwV1dIh0qOzt8gk8lw9-HgI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832158/VRG_VergreLive_Event.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4trFch"&gt;One of the internet’s foundational laws just turned 25 years old, and it’s never been more controversial. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects websites and apps from liability for user-generated content, helping to create the internet of today. But problems with online harassment and other crimes — plus mistrust of big services that benefit from the law — have led to calls for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mi8e25"&gt;Congress has introduced several proposals to overhaul Section 230, most recently the SAFE TECH Act, a sweeping rollback of the law’s protections. These proposals would affect the entire internet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;raising huge questions&lt;/a&gt; about the future of online communication. Yet public debate has focused on just a few companies: Facebook, Twitter, and Google, tagged collectively as “Big Tech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VTDAME"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10347701"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OPDMjL"&gt;On March 1st at 2PM ET, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will host a forum on the future of Section 230. One of the sponsors of the SAFE TECH Act, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), will discuss how she’s approaching tech regulation and her agenda for the next congressional term. Then, we’ll be moderating a panel with some of the voices that Section 230 debates often ignore — including nonprofit organizations and smaller online businesses. We’ll be announcing that slate of panelists in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4D6rc"&gt;Like a lot of things in 2021, we’ll be holding this event remotely, meeting over video and taking live audience questions online. It’s free, and you can &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/thevergelive/thevergearticle"&gt;register online right now&lt;/a&gt;. Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google rebrands G Suite for Education to Google Workspace for Education</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_o80hoRLAQNFGvdpq8_pvdWu8Ec=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832081/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKMgwa"&gt;Google is announcing a swath of new features for its education-focused products today, including that G Suite for Education is being &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-workspace-for-education"&gt;rebranded to Google Workspace for Education&lt;/a&gt;. The company first unveiled the Workspace branding for its office apps suite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503649/google-workspace-g-suite-gmail-chat-meet-docs"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, but the education-focused suite had retained the G Suite branding until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzgs0r"&gt;Among other changes to the different tiers, the free edition of G Suite for Education is being renamed to Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals and G Suite Enterprise for Education is being renamed to Google Workspace for Education Plus. If you’re already a G Suite Enterprise for Education customer, you’ll automatically roll over to Google Workspace for Education Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qPxa67"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is also announcing data storage policy changes for its education customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Cg92r"&gt;Google is also announcing data storage policy changes for its education customers. Previously, Google offered unlimited storage to qualifying institutions, but starting next year, the company will move schools toward a pooled storage model, offering a baseline of 100TB of pooled storage shared among an institution. The policy will go into effect for all existing Google Workspace for Education customers in July 2022 and will be in place for new customers that sign up in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFY34g"&gt;There are also new features on the way for Google’s Meet videoconferencing service to &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/Google-Meet-safety-and-engagement"&gt;make it better for virtual learning&lt;/a&gt;, and some of those features are coming to non-education customers as well. The new features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="beRFB4"&gt;The ability to mute everyone on a call and end a call for everyone attending. This is rolling out soon and will come to education customers first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E4niCQ"&gt;Emoji reactions, which will launch by August for all Meet users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="35hClk"&gt;Meeting transcripts, which are launching for education and enterprise Meet customers later this year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3HvF2H"&gt;In addition, Google is integrating Meet and its Google Classroom product &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/classroom-roadmap"&gt;more tightly&lt;/a&gt;. Students won’t be able to join Meet calls created from Classroom before the teacher does, and Meet will be able to restrict meetings to just students and teachers in a class based on a Classroom roster. These features, and others, will launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPuyf3"&gt;There are also new features in the works for Google Classroom, including support for add-ons from third-party services (available for Google Workspace for Education Plus or Teaching and Learning Upgrade customers) and offline support for the Classroom Android app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will block Australian users and publishers from sharing news links in response to new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8H1TJFTo6zIjS1epADmSHhtp80=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831733/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RDeqE"&gt;Facebook has decided to block both Australian users and media companies from sharing links to news articles and related content on its main social network, following the country’s proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;landmark regulatory measure&lt;/a&gt; that would force tech giants to pay Australian news organizations for using their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcX3WV"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6652"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; passed the Australian House of Representatives today and is believed to have enough votes to pass the Senate, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The bill also targets Google, which at one point last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to leave the country entirely&lt;/a&gt;. However, Google has since decided to start cutting deals with major Australian media organizations, like &lt;a href="https://newscorp.com/2021/02/17/news-corp-and-google-agree-to-global-partnership-on-news/"&gt;Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, to comply. Facebook, it appears, will not follow suit — for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DC2f8J"&gt;“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” reads a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from William Easton, the managing director of Facebook Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand. “It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJHhnU"&gt;The policy change from Facebook will have stark consequences for both users and media organizations. Easton’s blog post outlines four distinct categories that will be affected and in what ways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wc8FXj"&gt;Australian publishers: “They are restricted from sharing or posting any content on Facebook Pages. Admins will still be able to access other features from their Facebook Page, including Page insights and Creator Studio. We will continue to provide access to all other standard Facebook services, including data tools and CrowdTangle.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hkhp2I"&gt;International publishers: “They can continue to publish news content on Facebook, but links and posts can’t be viewed or shared by Australian audiences.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mCdssv"&gt;Australian users: “They cannot view or share Australian or international news content on Facebook or content from Australian and international news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cB095A"&gt;International users: “They cannot view or share Australian news content on Facebook or content from Australian news Pages.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qMuOuX"&gt;Facebook says it’s using a “combination of technologies” to restrict news content and it will have processes for reviewing content that was removed inadvertently, although it is not sharing those processes at this time. It also says the news content changes won’t affect any of the company’s other products or services in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er8R0O"&gt;Easton’s blog post makes clear Facebook saw this measure as a last resort. The company cites statistics, like how news content makes up less than 4 percent of what people see in the News Feed and how Facebook drove an estimated AU$407 million in referrals to Australian news publishers, as reasons why it felt the bill unfairly penalizes tech platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z5H1kK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fECUJC"&gt;Facebook also draws a distinction between how news publishers and readers access news content on its social network versus Google’s search engine. “Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue,” Easton argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuF9M0"&gt;“We were prepared to launch Facebook News in Australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers, however, we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place,” Easton goes on. “This legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements, and ultimately, how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid. We will now prioritise investments to other countries, as part of our plans to invest in new licensing news programs and experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The podcast wars will come down to ad tech, not exclusive content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfsgvhQ9s3vGEfV1YTdfVxYoP5s=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831596/adiaconis_201202_4322_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alix Diaconis / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5g8o7h"&gt;iHeartMedia, the company behind podcasts like &lt;em&gt;Stuff You Should Know&lt;/em&gt; and hundreds of radio stations across the US, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iheartmedia-to-acquire-triton-digital-from-scripps-11613563201"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s spending $230 million to acquire a platform many people outside the audio industry have likely never heard of: Triton Digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDsUWF"&gt;Triton Digital specializes in audio ad technology, particularly for live radio broadcasts and podcasts. The company is able to insert ads dynamically, meaning they’re tailored to the individual listener on the fly, and create its own podcast rankings based on access to third-party podcast networks, like NPR. Essentially, iHeart can now take on an even bigger role in the audio advertising space, both in selling and programming ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk4IQh"&gt;This news suggests ad technology will determine who ultimately cashes in on audio. We’ve already seen this point play out in other recent acquisitions. Spotify bought Megaphone, a hosting platform with a dynamic ad insertion marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt;, and SiriusXM acquired Midroll, an ad-serving marketplace and platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21315911/siriusxm-stitcher-podcast-deal-buy-midroll-earwolf"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UezDkT"&gt;Spotify’s made the biggest splash in audio over the past couple years with flashy acquisitions of podcasting networks and deals with big name stars, like Kim Kardashian West and the Obama family. But the exclusives route isn’t necessarily panning out. Joe Budden, one of Spotify’s original exclusive shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;left the network&lt;/a&gt; when his contract expired in September to instead make his show available everywhere, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262497/joe-budden-podcast-network-patreon-spotify"&gt;bonus, Patreon-only content&lt;/a&gt;. Michelle Obama’s show, which was widely hyped as a major exclusive get, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494284/spotify-michelle-obama-podcast-release-exclusive"&gt;now has its first season available everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrWzEY"&gt;Exclusive deals garner headlines and attention, but when it comes to succeeding in the medium to long-term, ad sales will be key. Brian Kaminsky, chief data officer and president of revenue strategies at iHeart, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this acquisition allows the company to create the equivalent of Google Ad Manager for audio, where advertisers can be paired with all kinds of audio programming to meet their goals. For iHeart, data on shows, ad purchases, and ad programming will happen on one united backend. (Kaminsky clarifies that iHeart will still employ and rely on a sales team, not just a digital marketplace.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEH2fU"&gt;“We will have the only complete ad technology stack for all forms of audio, so broadcast, streaming, podcasts, voice audio content experiences,” he says. “That puts iHeart in a position literally to serve the audio advertising needs of every customer possible, and not just the sort of enterprise class customer that you think of when you think of the big agencies, but all the way down through to the long tail of small businesses and people who were using self-service platforms to buy video and display and social from the likes of Facebook and Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUHKll"&gt;Although Google has entered the podcasting industry through its Google Podcasts player, the company only mentioned serving audio ads &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/admanager/listen-new-features-grow-your-digital-audio-business/"&gt;as a beta feature&lt;/a&gt; in August last year. The company says it’s exploring more ways to monetize audio, however, and will have updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7N51y"&gt;Of course, as it goes with acquisitions, Triton’s existing customers might now be put in an uncomfortable bind. Entercom, an iHeart competitor that runs radio stations around the US, is a customer of Triton, for example, as is NPR and others. They might not want to put their money in iHeart’s pockets. Kaminsky says Triton will remain separate from iHeart with its own management and tech teams, and he points out that iHeart &lt;a href="https://www.iheartmedia.com/Other-Businesses"&gt;already operates&lt;/a&gt; three other companies that do business regularly with competitors with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlnuOb"&gt;“Obviously, we’re going to be sensitive to people’s concerns, we’re not going to just be cavalier about it, but I think that most folks in the audio community are going to see this as a good thing,” he says. “iHeart has been a staunch supporter of broadcast radio, of companionship audio, of audio as part of the community, as opposed to audio that’s driven exclusively by technology, and I think that the players in the audio space will see that and will continue to avail themselves of the technology and services that Triton provides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXBt16"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s biggest new hit is a Viking survival game that struck like a bolt from the blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1jZ3m6OHe2wY4qSrBownsaWqo4=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831563/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxySs4"&gt;The other day, I saw a game named &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn’t ready to commit quite yet — I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? &lt;em&gt;One million other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67WpZr"&gt;On February 10th, just eight days after launch, indie developer Iron Gate announced that &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;had &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970?emclan=103582791463217109&amp;amp;emgid=3059603085894895511"&gt;already sold 1 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after that, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715"&gt;reached 2 million sales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Here are a few other facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4TAu80"&gt;It has now been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;the second-most played game on &lt;em&gt;all of Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point, ahead of every game save &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s comfortably sitting at number three now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzcx0K"&gt;It’s already set a top-ten record for concurrent players on Steam &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/app/892970/graphs/"&gt;with roughly 392,000&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, knocking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;off that top 10 chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WJosSj"&gt;It topped the Steam Top Sellers list during Valve’s Steam Lunar New Year sale — despite having zero discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttr5q0GEPIwdbRlpZ4pb474KNjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309259/steam_charts_top_played_games.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6RSp0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-may-well-be-steams-biggest-ever-viral-hit/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s trajectory is unlike anything we’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUq6tJ"&gt;The closest parallel is perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which similarly came out of Steam Early Access, sold oodles of copies during Steam sales &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steam-summer-sale-pubg-player-unknown-battlegrounds/"&gt;(also without being on sale&lt;/a&gt;), set a record for the Steam game with the most simultaneous players (3.2 million) that still stands today, and kicked off the entire battle royale genre that spawned today’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more. But even &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; took months to reach the kind of numbers that &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; already has now, and that was with a genre-defining, action-packed, nail-biting, streamer-friendly game that makes for a delightfully tense watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MmalvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Technically, ‘Valheim’ released a 2018 alpha build on itch.io&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjhWdv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, by comparison, is slow and methodical. It’s part of an established genre of survival games where you scavenge and harvest, chop and dig, hunt and skin, then build better tools to do it all more efficiently over and over again. Only here, you’re also a badass Viking who can (eventually) build fortresses and ships, you’re hunting down gods for sport, and you’re exploring &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-player-discovers-whats-beyond-the-edge-of-its-enormous-map/"&gt;a gobsmackingly gigantic map&lt;/a&gt; filled with idyllic scenery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrikJarlestam/status/1361604565531959305"&gt;charming music&lt;/a&gt;, a touch of lived-in mystery, and some enemies that stomp me convincingly enough that I get a slight &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; vibe out of it. Oh, and when you cut down trees, they fall and hit other things (like you) for massive damage! That’s never going to get old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvXfF31K_kYujVsQz_1WN9Ow060=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309294/valheim_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s graphics may seem dull at first but can be picturesque, particularly with eye candy like depth of field, tessellation, and sun shafts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zklytf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;As Cass Marshall at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also incredibly accessible and easy to learn — I’d convinced myself that I disliked survival games due to their typically rigid mechanics, but in &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; everything seems to make sense without thinking too hard. I don’t need to spend ages punching trees to build some basic tools, there’s no need to acquire blueprints (recipes unlock as soon as you find new materials), and I don’t have to painstakingly plan how I want my house to look before I start building. You can instantly demolish a portion of a structure and refund your materials if it’s not quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk3PCo"&gt;In fact, building is fast enough that I’m starting to build temporary forward operating bases before I venture into each new area, like the tiny fort below that took all of five minutes and I’ve since expanded twice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDoTrQoXUEMDG9CjIsfEfptUEqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309305/valheim_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It gets real dark at night. Fire is a must if you’re planning to stay up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3dFC"&gt;There’s no telling how long the magic will last for me or for the game’s 2 million players and counting, of course. It’s been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#1y"&gt;all downhill for &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only attracts one-tenth of its peak player count of 438,000 last September (though it could still be wildly popular on mobile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKI4K5"&gt;But I imagine word-of-mouth may keep &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; going for a while. I can’t wait to try the game’s two- to ten-player co-op mode with my circle of friends, and that means more copies in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khWT2s"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;does have staying power, expect to hear this game’s name on a lot of lips in the months to come. If history’s any indication, we’ll soon see a rush of knockoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-18-mobile-version-of-fall-guys-is-a-scam-mediatonic-warns"&gt;fake-outs&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to make other games play more like it, and there may be a lot of pressure on Iron Gate to port the PC-only game to consoles and phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;
