    <title>Watch the first five minutes of Netflix’s Fear Street trilogy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBDoIPC8DioAIruvoYUBJjFD9E4=/210x0:1782x1048/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526851/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.13.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BCFb8t"&gt;Netflix has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8BjVmKJnPY"&gt;the first five minutes&lt;/a&gt; of its upcoming horror movie trilogy &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt;, inspired by R.L. Stine’s &lt;em&gt;Fear Street &lt;/em&gt;series of young adult novels. The film trilogy, which will be released over three Fridays starting on July 2nd, is also split across three separate time periods: 1994, 1978, and 1666. Teens fleeing for their lives is universal, regardless of the year, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTvc31"&gt;Here’s Netflix’s synopsis for the films:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QfN0Ru"&gt;In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events that have haunted their town for generations ​may all be connected — and that they may be the next targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JXiW4L"&gt;As someone who grew up on &lt;em&gt;Goosebumps &lt;/em&gt;and marathoned the made-for-TV movie adaptations of the books every Halloween, &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; seems like a pretty great update on that vibe. These first five minutes aren’t super scary, but they do translate some classic slasher movie tropes into R.L. Stine’s goofy style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cip8wY"&gt;If you want a more expansive look at the whole series, rather than just the first entry —  &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part One: 1994 — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444575/netflix-fear-street-trilogy-rl-stine-release-date"&gt;you can check out this trailer from May&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GFVJjj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyMOBcDMS6c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MCKE45"&gt;There’s not long to wait before you can get your R.L. Stine summer going: &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part One: 1994&lt;/em&gt; premieres July 2nd, followed by &lt;em&gt;Feat Street Part Two: 1978 &lt;/em&gt;on July 9th, and &lt;em&gt;Fear Street Part Three: 1666&lt;/em&gt; on July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Music Widget brings back the original Mac OS X iTunes widget </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBUOzLPYFsArf_EmTmaoJFxcNSY=/180x0:2226x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526721/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_5.35.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVvWck"&gt;Way back in 2005, Apple released Mac OS X Tiger, and with it, the original implementation of widgets on the Mac through its Dashboard software. One of those widgets was a now-defunct iTunes media player — but thanks to the efforts of programmer Mario Guzman, who’s recreated an &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;exact replica of the widget&lt;/a&gt; for modern Macs, you can once again enjoy your music in retro OS X style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWlpeF"&gt;Ironically, the new Music Widget isn’t actually a widget (at least, not in the current style of widgets introduced in last year’s macOS Big Sur,) but rather a standalone app that mimics the look of the original iTunes widget from 2005. The app is fully functional, offering the same controls as the original. Music Widget only works with the Apple Music app, though— Spotify (or other music apps) won’t work with the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UzDpD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alright nerds. I have an early beta version of my Music Widget up for download. Let me know what you think. Retweets/screenshots are welcome.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/51sfimm7LI"&gt;https://t.co/51sfimm7LI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mario Guzman  ️‍      (@MarioGuzman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarioGuzman/status/1408876166165893122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCWRTu"&gt;Guzman’s replica also draws most of the artwork and UI elements directly in code, instead of using images, so you’re not stuck with 2005-era visuals on the widget when running on a pixel-dense Retina display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="R2X14x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Listen to Spotify on this nostalgic iPod-style web music player","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="L6rCTI"&gt;It’s not the only retro-style music player to pop up recently, either: &lt;a href="https://tannerv.com/ipod/"&gt;software developer Tanner Villarete&lt;/a&gt; created a stylistically similar web app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;offers an iPod Classic interface&lt;/a&gt; for listening to your Spotify or Apple Music library earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcZ2uj"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/#download"&gt;Music Widget is still in beta&lt;/a&gt;, and can be downloaded for free from Guzman’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to restore your iPhone from iOS 15 beta back to iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/436VxKbwU5MbJ4reDRcGvy8orFw=/0x8:1984x1331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526531/Apple_iPhone12Pro_iOS15_3up_060721.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15 comes with a number of new features and tweaks&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyiSDk"&gt;Beta versions of new software are great to try out, but sometimes you realize that they’re not so good for day-to-day usage. If you’ve upgraded your iPhone to the iOS 15 beta, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;now available to the public&lt;/a&gt;, and you realize that you need to go back to the stable world of iOS 14.6, you can do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33XqPZ"&gt;The simplest way to go back to a stable version is to delete the iOS 15 beta profile and wait until the next update shows up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4WWqTe"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="54TVu0"&gt;Select “Profiles and &amp;amp; Device Management”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cRK43P"&gt;Select “Remove Profile” and restart your iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UOQ9ma"&gt;Unfortunately, you won’t be able to return to a non-beta version of iOS until a new update is available. (You can check if one is available by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”) If you don’t want to wait, you can do a more thorough recovery — it’s more complicated, but it will get you back to where you were sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WauVpJ"&gt;The first thing you have to do is put your iPhone into Recovery Mode. This is done by connecting your iPhone to your computer (making sure it’s up to date first). I tested these instructions using a MacBook Pro, but they should work using a PC as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8garSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aA7tkf"&gt;You then begin by doing the following (the following three bulleted directions are directly quoted from &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263"&gt;Apple’s support page&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IXr9IH"&gt;For iPhone 8 or later: Press and quickly release the Volume Up button. Press and quickly release the Volume Down button. Then, press and hold the Side button until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J5BNNc"&gt;For iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or iPod touch (7th generation): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zQq1vM"&gt;For iPhone 6s and earlier, iPad with Home button, or iPod touch (6th generation or earlier): Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. Don’t release the buttons when you see the Apple logo. Continue to hold both buttons until you see the recovery mode screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="57A5kp"&gt;Whichever iPhone you have, once you follow the above directions, you should see a symbol showing a cable connecting to a computer on your iPhone. Turn your attention to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Pi5yOq"&gt;There will be a notice asking if you want to update, restore, or cancel. Select “Restore.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZEKOWpGch4GGahwRN0LFab78Qg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692236/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.25.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4UZSYp"&gt;You’ll be asked whether you’re sure you want to restore your phone since you’re about to wipe out any personalization and go back to factory settings. Select “Restore and Update.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2R7InZ5sccPfHMZ-aIdh3y0B6WA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692200/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.29.45_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Yd7dQP"&gt;You’ll be told that you’re going to be updated to iOS 14.6 (which is the most recent version of iOS 14). Select “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K6zyi6YMqLVBuLycYtwiiGf4cO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.30.49_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="inW1XG"&gt;At this point, you’ll be asked to agree to all of the various licensing data that you agreed to last time that you began using your iPhone. Click on “Agree.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EazkH"&gt;You’ll then be told that your computer is downloading the software for the iPhone. It should take a while, maybe 15 minutes or so, depending on your system and your network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCF3CvoTljUMX6uPz8AtFFdMsfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692218/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.31.15_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vNZJFp"&gt;Once the OS has been downloaded, you’ll be told that it is being installed on your phone (and the phone will visibly begin uploading the software and will probably restart once or twice). When it’s done, you’ll be told via your computer screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-C3RRC8o0Cul_zf74wV-zJwICAQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692231/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.40.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VlJLnE"&gt;Okay, now you should have restored your iPhone back to iOS 14.6. That’s all well and good, but you’ve got what is essentially a clean slate — you want to restore all your apps, personalization, and other stuff, right? This is where your backup comes in. (You &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; back up your phone before you installed the iOS 15 beta, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fGHQsR"&gt;You’ll be asked if you want to set up your iPhone using the settings from another phone. If you’ve got another with all of your settings on it, well and good — just follow the directions. But assuming that you’re going to restore from a backup, tap on “Set Up Manually.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iWdY5K"&gt;At this point, you’ll enter your Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TvcyXT"&gt;You then choose how you want to restore your backup: from iCloud, from a Mac or PC, from an iPhone, or from an Android phone. You can also decide not to transfer any data at all. Let’s assume you’ve backed up to iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0iv157"&gt;Once you’ve made that choice, you’ll be asked to enter your Apple ID name and password and to enter a verification code sent to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xePpsP"&gt;If you’ve made more than one backup recently, you’ll be able to choose which. (Hopefully it will not be a backup from iOS 15, which will not be transferable.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q3K0a4"&gt;Once you’ve chosen your backup, it will be transferred to your iPhone, and you should be back where you started before you installed iOS 15. You should be able to use your iPhone fairly quickly; however, it will take a few minutes before everything is uploaded from your backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="er2aC6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram may be working on subscriber-only stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhK_-RH-IO9QzRvk7qSg8Sef7sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526529/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YSyF9l"&gt;Instagram appears to be exploring a new feature that shares some similarities with Twitter’s Super Follows, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Called “Exclusive Stories,” the possible future feature, spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a"&gt;developer Alessandro Paluzzi&lt;/a&gt;, allows creators to post exclusive content to their Instagram story that’s presumably only available to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjZXRX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1406995654900125702?s=20"&gt;Based on the screenshots Paluzzi shared&lt;/a&gt;, exclusive stories are differentiated in your feed with a purple tag (similar to how Close Friends posts have a green one). When you try to watch an exclusive story without being a fan of the person sharing, you’re prompted with a pop-up that says only fans can watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BlgvH3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; continues to work on the exclusive stories for Fan clubs  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ The Exclusive Stories icon will be purple. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Qzzdodeqf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Qzzdodeqf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1408017220391903234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxKaW"&gt;It’s a very early look at what Instagram could be considering — so much so that the company says it’s unable to share more, other than confirm that the screenshots are from an internal prototype and that it's not currently testing anything. It does make sense that Instagram would consider and even implement a feature like this at some point. CEO Adam Mosseri has &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund"&gt;been open about exploring subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="actqJP"&gt;There’s been intense focus in the last year on allowing creators to monetize their work across a wide swath of platforms. Following the explosive growth of Substack, Instagram’s parent company Facebook made a recent addition with the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555957/facebook-bulletin-newsletter-subscriptions-substack-competitor"&gt;its newsletter platform Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545167/twitter-opens-super-follows-ticketed-spaces-new-feature-test-application-ios-android"&gt;opened up applications&lt;/a&gt; for Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces earlier this month, which, while somewhat unknown quantities right now, share some similarities with this hypothetical Instagram feature: Super Follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;allow Twitter users to share exclusive tweets&lt;/a&gt; with subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDkAYC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmVwDu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Head of Instagram says Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instagram Reels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8z33k3Uqxjv2K3b3Fr8GWJx-WmA=/79x0:3127x2032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526527/Reels_IOSX_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n5GZ5D"&gt;Instagram is no longer a photo sharing app, according to Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram. In a video posted to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQwNfFBJr5A/"&gt;his Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; accounts, Mosseri said the company is looking to lean into entertainment and video after seeing the success of competitors like TikTok and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERsJgZ"&gt;He describes some upcoming changes and experiments that Instagram will be doing, including showing users recommendations for topics they’re not following and making video more immersive by offering a full-screen experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tNpt79"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Changes are coming to video on Instagram  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Instagram we’re always trying to build new features that help you get the most out of your experience. Right now we’re focused on four key areas: Creators, Video, Shopping and Messaging. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ezFp4hfDpf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ezFp4hfDpf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XDUOiy"&gt;We heard recently about Instagram’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547045/instagram-suggested-posts-test-algorithm"&gt;experiments with algorithmic additions inside the main feed&lt;/a&gt;, but the idea of basing them off of topics that users can select appears to be a new one for the platform. The app has also had full-screen video experiences for a while for content posted to IGTV, Reels, and Stories, but Mosseri says the company wants to “embrace video more broadly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i30OA"&gt;The message that Instagram is sending is clear: it no longer wants to be thought of as the “square photo-sharing app,” as Mosseri puts it, but instead as a general entertainment app driven by algorithms and videos. At the moment, though, it’s vague as to how Instagram plans on doing that — and whether it’ll be improving and innovating on features popularized by apps like TikTok or just making something with a few Facebook-y tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord now lets you share a little more about yourself in your profile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oYHVKxEuMxW0fZ32mCnmAXmZkjo=/14x0:1280x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526501/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_1_12_25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bfOmGF"&gt;Messaging app Discord has added the ability to customize your profile just a little bit more than you could before: you can now fill in a short “About Me” blurb, and, if you have Discord’s premium Nitro subscription, you can add a banner image to your profile. I noticed the change in the Mac version of Discord on Wednesday, but I haven’t opened the app for a little while, so it may have been added sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKN4TQ"&gt;To make the changes, at least on the Mac version of the app, click on the User Settings gear, then the “User Profile” section. (That section had a bright red “New!” alert on it when I first opened up Discord settings.) From there, you can write a 190-character blurb about yourself (which can include markdown and links if you want), and Nitro subscribers can add a banner image in the form of a PNG, JPG, or an animated GIF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9T0LMv"&gt;Then, when someone clicks on your name in a server that you’re in, they’ll see your “About Me” bio and banner image if you’ve set them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-XOCHSsJCSaYOdd12rhr_riUS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692356/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_1_47_23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My updated profile card in a Discord server.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tTtHCm"&gt;I’m not seeing the option to add a bio or a banner image in the iOS version of the app and have asked Discord if the ability to customize your profile this way is coming to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="685zlI"&gt;Discord has also added another new feature that is currently rolling out: &lt;a href="https://blog.discord.com/unleash-your-creativity-with-stickers-on-discord-99363194871"&gt;stickers or large animated emoji&lt;/a&gt;. Custom sticker packs can be added to servers that &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-"&gt;have been boosted&lt;/a&gt; (which means they are supported by members via direct monthly payments or through free boosts included in a Nitro subscription) past level one, and Nitro subscribers will have access to 300 Discord-made stickers they can use across the platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo’s new electric concept car is a ‘manifesto’ for the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bBnnBit0xxOXk7RMZPmo4UxCIPo=/399x0:4701x2868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526481/283695_Volvo_Concept_Recharge.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2pzu8"&gt;Volvo unveiled a new concept car that forecasts the Swedish automaker’s all-electric future.   The vehicle was revealed during a “Tech Day” event held Wednesday during which Volvo laid out an extensive roadmap to becoming an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;EV-only carmaker by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7e4aw"&gt;The vehicle, called “Concept Recharge,” features suicide doors that open up to a roomy interior, where the lack of an internal combustion engine means more space for the driver and passengers. The sleek exterior design and minimalist interior certainly evoke Tesla but also are reminiscent of other EVs on the market, such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByvzBa"&gt;But the concept won’t necessarily appear in this form as a production vehicle. Henrik Green, chief technology officer at Volvo, said it was likely that a “version” of the Concept Recharge could become reality within the next three years — excluding the dramatic suicide doors, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FPOyKK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10631864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQNIOU"&gt;“All of the proportions are realistic for us in the future,” Green told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Having what we call the suicide doors without the B-post might be the thing that doesn’t appear in the real car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDJQCB"&gt;Volvo said it plans to sell 600,000 by the middle of the decade and will build a battery manufacturing facility in Europe by 2026. The company has said it is working with Swedish partner Northvolt on a new generation of batteries with higher energy density and designed to be integrated as a structural element of the vehicle. The new batteries, due after 2025, will enable a longer driving range between charges — up to 625 miles (1,006 km) — and much faster charging times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8n3NK0"&gt;The company reiterated its plans to equip many of its cars with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;lidar laser sensors from Luminar&lt;/a&gt;, which will help improve safety and set the stage for more autonomous driving features in the future. Last week, Volvo announced that lidar will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22547453/volvo-lidar-standard-autonomous-luminar-xc90-2022"&gt;come as standard&lt;/a&gt; in its passenger vehicles, though the hands-free highway driving feature that the lidar will enable will cost extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UREz4f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volvo is also bringing software development in-house&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g0jl3r"&gt;Volvo is also bringing software development in-house, which Green described as a way to help speed up the deployment of new updates to the company’s fleet or correct bugs in the system. The new operating system, which will be called VolvoCars.OS, will power the company’s next generation of electric vehicles and will enable unsupervised driving on highways. (Currently, all advanced driver assist systems require drivers to pay attention to the road.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f240S"&gt;The new OS will act as an “umbrella system” for all of the underlying systems that operate within the vehicle, including Android Automotive OS, Blackberry’s QNX, Linux, and AUTOSAR — which Green said he “wouldn’t mind getting rid of.” Green said he also “wouldn’t mind” making Volvo’s entire software platform open source if it helps improve the quality of the automaker’s features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hEFD5"&gt;Volvo said its new architecture will feature a core computer comprised of two systems-on-a-chip provided by Nvidia. Initially, one will focus on core driving functions, while the other on semi-autonomous features and more advanced functions. In the future, Volvo hopes to synthesize the two computers into one system for more efficient processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7j6cvr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volvo hopes to synthesize the two computers into one system for more efficient processing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUuQwV"&gt;Next year, Volvo plans on unveiling its flagship electric vehicle, the new XC90 SUV. The company’s first EV, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, went on sale this year, and the follow-up, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, will be available later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZmUvk"&gt;Volvo is the latest automaker to lay out a grand vision for how it plans on tackling the twin challenges of electrification and autonomy. Previously, Tesla and Volkswagen have produced similar events. Volvo, which has nurtured a reputation for safety over the years, said it’s realizing that technology could be a bigger driver of sales in the future than anything related to airbags or crash resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOS01P"&gt;“People are actually buying a car because it has Android infotainment system, and it works seamlessly with your phone or ecosystem,” Green said. “And that could be more of a driving factor than a new nameplate.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s web source code NFT sells for $5.4 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sotheby’s Offers NFT Of Jay-Z’s Original Debut Album Art By Derrick Adams &amp;amp;amp; Sir Tim Berners-Lee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msxdG6T_lTt5d4XpIN7hR5p3hCw=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526201/1326146532.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iv2I9E"&gt;The latest mega-auction of an NFT tied to a piece of internet history is complete, with Sir Tim Berners-Lee selling a digital item representing source code to the original web browser &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fthis-changed-everything-source-code-for-www-x-tim-berners-lee-an-nft%2Fsource-code-for-the-www&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557765%2Fwww-nft-tim-berners-lee-sothebys-source-code" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $5,434,500&lt;/a&gt;. Berners-Lee is credited as the creator of the world wide web that this site is published on, and the NFT includes a time-stamped signed archive including 10,000 lines of the source code that initially made it possible to display an HTML document, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UANWj"&gt;For comparison, the highest price for an NFT remains the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327594/metakovan-beeple-highest-auction-price-69-million-nft"&gt;$69 million or so MetaKovan paid to own &lt;em&gt;Everydays: the First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt; by the artist Beeple&lt;/a&gt;, while Jack Dorsey’s digital collectible representing the first tweet on Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter"&gt;sold for a little less than $3 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;div id="wBFnYK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="blJHMO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m selling a picture that I made, with a Python programme that I wrote myself, of what the source code would look like if it was stuck on the wall and signed by me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7OP1iF"&gt;After the auction was announced, there was some backlash to the plan, whether due to general unease over NFTs, environmental concerns, or otherwise. Berners-Lee and his wife say they will use the proceeds to benefit causes they support. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, Berners-Lee said “This is totally aligned with the values of the web ... I’m selling a picture that I made, with a Python programme that I wrote myself, of what the source code would look like if it was stuck on the wall and signed by me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFuWWz"&gt;According to a condition report &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fthis-changed-everything-source-code-for-www-x-tim-berners-lee-an-nft%2Fsource-code-for-the-www&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557765%2Fwww-nft-tim-berners-lee-sothebys-source-code" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed along with the NFT&lt;/a&gt; by Sothebys, the data security of this particular item is “very high.” For owners of NFTs worried about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;potentially losing their multimillion dollar purchase due to servers going down or link rot&lt;/a&gt;, the platform they’ve used  says it includes both Arweave and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k42mnj"&gt;The only remaining issue may be the collectible itself, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikko/status/1410191059481673730"&gt;some have noted&lt;/a&gt; that while the archived code is intact, the video included in the purchase renders angle brackets incorrectly. It won’t stop you from compiling an early-’90s web browser of your own (non-millionaires can experience that glory &lt;a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for free), but it is an unwelcome smudge on such a high-priced item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkcPL2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile and Verizon have implemented the FCC’s anti-spoofing system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktub7U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fpress%2Ft-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557539%2Ft-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that it is fully compliant with the FCC’s new anti-spoofing protocol, telling the FCC that its now certifying that calls from its network are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;protected against impersonation by scam callers&lt;/a&gt; using the STIR/SHAKEN protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5kh04"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s verifying that the number that shows up on your caller ID is actually the number that’s calling you using the same STIR/SHAKEN protocol. The two major carriers announcing their progress on the same day isn’t a coincidence — Wednesday, June 30th, is the deadline the FCC set for major carriers to implement STIR/SHAKEN. An AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier also met the deadline, as it filed on the 29th, &lt;strong&gt;and said that “all LTE and 5G calls originating on [its] wireless network are STIR/SHAKEN compliant.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wo2aX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The protocol works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="31Lb2O"&gt;The protocol, with its James Bond-themed name, works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number and showing up on your caller ID as a local caller. The FCC hopes that carriers implementing it will help stem the tide of robocalls that have made many of us scared of our phones’ actual phone function. &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;In a press release put out on Wednesday (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, the commission stated that over 1,500 voice providers have filed to be included in its Robocall Mitigation Database, with over 200 of those providers being fully certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4obFxo"&gt;The Wednesday deadline set by the FCC is only for major carriers — smaller carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers will be exempt until June 30th, 2023, though the FCC &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;is considering shortening that timespan (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. The major carriers that haven’t certified themselves as compliant may face an unspecified “appropriate enforcement action” from the FCC and will run into even more trouble come September. Beginning September 28th, &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/062199369474/DA-21-727A1.pdf"&gt;according to the FCC (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, carriers will have to stop accepting traffic from providers that aren’t in the robocall database — it’s hard to imagine customers being too happy that they’re not able to reach their friends or family who are on T-Mobile or Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pxxocJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;While this may mean a significant drop in spam calls, it’s not bulletproof&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="3oH7IG"&gt;The STIR/SHAKEN protocol &lt;a href="https://blog.hiya.com/stir/shaken-does-it-reduce-illegal-call-spoofing"&gt;isn’t a total solution&lt;/a&gt; to the robocall problem, and it won’t keep your phone from ringing when a scammer calls you unless your carrier is doing additional blocking using the data from it. &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/fcc-deadline-for-stir-shaken-caller-id-authentication-nears"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless&lt;/em&gt; also points out&lt;/a&gt; that carriers still have to contend with international calls, which is no small task, and legacy phone systems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;are exempt from the requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the next time you get a phone call, you may be able to see whether the number that’s calling you is actually who it claims to be. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An intrepid YouTuber created a handheld that runs macOS Big Sur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EQYUaNMcI552o163fDNHO60rwY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526150/big_sur.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Iketsj/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hcbhu"&gt;Have you ever been using a recently updated Mac computer and thought, “Man, I would love to use this operating system with a really tiny keyboard and a really tiny screen?” Okay, me neither, but I certainly would love the opportunity to carry a MacBook around in my pocket and whip it out on command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OD6MQ8"&gt;Apparently, YouTuber Ike T. Sanglay Jr., or “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS6wGHldCdaA1mtfXWHJ8yA"&gt;Iketsj,”&lt;/a&gt; has had this thought as well. In this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdsdrqA-50"&gt;eight-minute vlog&lt;/a&gt;, the YouTuber builds a tiny handheld PC that can run macOS Big Sur, and it’s very fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s7ETa"&gt;The PC includes a LattePanda Alpha SBC (single board computer) with an Intel Core m3 CPU and 8GB of RAM, as well as an Arduino Leonardo microcontroller board, a 240GB SATA SSD with the operating system preinstalled, and a 3D-printed case (of course). Watch as Sanglay winds cables, cleans screens, cuts screws, and plugs things into ports. The device comes together slowly but surely, to the tune of some serene music that’s much catchier than a YouTube background tune has any business being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibqp2v"&gt;Sanglay eventually boots the thing up, and sure enough, macOS Big Sur is there. The battery indicator doesn’t appear to be working, but the interface otherwise seems fully operational in the limited footage we see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7QsU4"&gt;Now, does this device have a real purpose in the working world? Probably not, and its creator admits as much. “Maybe you’ll say that the handheld macOS is not practical, yada yada yada. Well, sure, you’re right. I just want to make one for myself,” Sanglay notes on camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgsyoK"&gt;The YouTuber is also fully aware that the price of the parts required for this stunt comes out to more than the price of an actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. “I know, but where’s the fun in that?” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJDT8v"&gt;Still, as someone who’s long been an advocate of macOS in more creative and portable form factors, I am all in favor. While I can’t imagine actually using macOS on a screen this small, I love the idea of being able to carry its powerful functionality around in such a small package. Plus, it’s just a cute little device. &lt;/p&gt;
