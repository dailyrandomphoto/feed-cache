    <title>NordicTrack will now let you yell at its smart dumbbells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman does russian twists with dumbbells while watching a workout on a tablet attached to the rack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3t-fDE8GB2gWTcI61BMJNlDJHA=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373777/Female_Twist_NordicTrack_iSelect_Voice_Controlled_Dumbbells.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NordicTrack’s new smart adjustable dumbbells also come with a tablet holder in the rack.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: iFIT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8CO05f"&gt;Smart dumbbells aren’t new in connected fitness, but today, NordicTrack is announcing a unique take on the product. The NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells are voice-controlled weights that work with Amazon Alexa. As in, you can now ask Alexa to adjust how heavy your dumbbells are instead of having to do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQHfcY"&gt;The dumbbells can be electronically adjusted between five and 50 pounds in five-pound increments. According to iFit, NordicTrack’s parent company, the dumbbells feature a “motorized weight selector” that enables users to quickly change the weight of the device. As for the Alexa integration, you can ask the voice assistant to set a specific weight, increase or decrease weight, or create a preset weight for specific exercises. You can create presets for 15 common dumbbell moves: biceps curls, overhead shoulder press, lateral shoulder raises, front shoulder raise, triceps extension, bent-over row, chest press, squat, deadlift, lunge, lateral lunge, wood chop, chest fly, reverse fly, and renegade row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tum6KB"&gt;While an iFit subscription is not required to use the dumbbells, the weights come with a free one-month family membership. You also need a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection, ostensibly for firmware upgrades and other support features. The dumbbells also come with their own rack, which is outfitted with a tablet holder so you can follow along with workouts from either iFit or whichever fitness app of your choice. The dumbbells can also be adjusted manually via a knob.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Woman turns knob embedded into the rack to adjust dumbbell weight" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oWgM6-vO6q5UCZc8d4XRbfdOOyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159342/Mechanical_Adjust_NordicTrack_iSelect_Voice_Controlled_Dumbbells.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also adjust the weights manually via a knob.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5PfOB0"&gt;At this point, you might be wondering: what is the point of voice-controlled dumbbells? Aside from accessibility reasons, it boils down to speed. If you’ve ever followed along with a fitness app’s strength training class, you’re often given only 10-30 seconds in between sets. Many adjustable dumbbells work using a pin mechanism to attach or detach additional plates — meaning if you rush, you can wind up with a plate falling off mid-exercise. (True story: instead of hitting pause, I rushed while tweaking my adjustable dumbbells and ended up with a five-pound plate smacking me in the face during a chest press.) You also have to return the dumbbells to the rack each time to add or take off plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AntlKA"&gt;If the dumbbells can actually quickly and safely change weights, that’d solve one of the biggest problems with adjustable dumbbells. However, other connected weights make similar promises with mixed results. I tested &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/jaxjox-kettlebell-connect-review-this-connected-kettle-1844285865"&gt;JaxJox’s smart adjustable kettlebell&lt;/a&gt;, and while it was convenient, it still took a hot second for the electronic locking mechanism to secure the weights. In this case, you’d still have to contend with Alexa understanding your commands, good Wi-Fi, and background noise from whatever class you’re watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Gj2Ja"&gt;At $429, these are on the cheaper end of connected fitness equipment but are still a hefty investment for the average person. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21443765/buying-dumbbells-online-expensive-resellers"&gt;dumbbell prices have been wonky&lt;/a&gt; ever since the start of the pandemic thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21396116/dumbbell-set-shortage-nordictrack-bowflex"&gt;shortages and shipping delays&lt;/a&gt;. As far as adjustable weights go, options with a similar weight range can cost anywhere from $200 to over $500. A full dumbbell rack can cost a few hundred or go well into the thousands of dollars — and may take up much more space than you’d like in your home. Another factor to keep in mind is that you need an Alexa-enabled device to use the voice controls. If you don’t have already have one, that’s another purchase to tack on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8lnLb"&gt;We’d have to review the NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells before we can definitively say how useful the voice-control feature is. But if you’re impatient, the dumbbells are available starting today at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/3036981011?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordicTrack’s Amazon store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify shuts down its namesake podcast studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it6jtllLRW5240UPkUQieAcnIMw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373807/mdoying_180308_1437_0030still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71v860"&gt;Spotify is disbanding its founding podcast studio and laying off some of the team. An affected employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Studio 4, or Spotify Studios as it’s been referenced externally, consisted of 10 to 15 employees and produced shows like &lt;em&gt;Dissect &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Chapo: Kingpin on Trial&lt;/em&gt;. Spotify called affected employees on Friday and said their last days would be January 21st. They’ll receive two months’ worth of severance. Some employees were reassigned while others were laid off and pointed to the Spotify job board. The studio’s head, Gina Delvac, was also let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OelVqs"&gt;Spotify declined to comment. In a note to Spotify staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, Julie McNamara, head of US studios and video, acknowledged the layoffs and said shutting the studio down would enable the company to “move faster and make more significant progress and facilitate more effective collaboration across our organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdXRxB"&gt;For a company sharing news of its podcasting endeavors most anywhere it can, Studio 4 rarely, if ever, showed up in the press. (I only documented one public use of it.) However, Studio 4 &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; occasionally appear in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;earnings reports&lt;/a&gt; as Spotify Studios. It was the first podcasting studio Spotify created and consisted of all the employees who worked on podcasting prior to the company’s major network acquisitions. Additional employees were later hired, but the initial group helped prove the podcasting business model and listener interest with shows like &lt;em&gt;Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls 1 Keith&lt;/em&gt;, says a former employee who asked not to be identified due to ongoing work in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="agRZsB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1522405"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xItWBc"&gt;The team eventually rounded out Spotify’s in-house studio offerings, including its three acquired networks: Parcast, Gimlet, and The Ringer. The Studio 4 name is literal, as in it’s the fourth studio at Spotify. It’s also, as one Spotify employee put it to me, “insulting” to the people who work there, given that it has no brand identity or mission statement. They say it often operated more like a “junk drawer” for projects that didn’t find a home within the other three networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tbRof"&gt;“When you have Studio 4, it’s like, ‘Well, if all of these boxes are already checked by all of these other studios, then where does that really leave us,’ and so it felt to me like there was no clear mandate of what Studio 4 was supposed to do,” the affected employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcXcJG"&gt;Though the studio didn’t have its own clear initiatives, its content covered music and artists as well as celebrity deals and influencer-hosted content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t09lSM"&gt;“A lot of the successes that Spotify Studios had were never really vocalized because the leadership was always churning,” the former employee says, pointing out that Liz Gately &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/spotify-liz-gateley-podcast-creative-development-1203152298/"&gt;formerly ran&lt;/a&gt; the studio but was then &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/liz-gateley-to-transition-to-consultant-role-at-spotify-4107080/"&gt;shuffled&lt;/a&gt; into a new role. Delvac took over, and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-julie-mcnamara-1235007800/"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; McNamara &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-julie-mcnamara-1235007800/"&gt;was hired&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the team under Courtney Holt, VP of global podcasting. (Above Holt sits Dawn Ostroff, chief content and advertising officer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orjDdZ"&gt;“I have never once heard anybody mentioned Studio 4 by name or point to any of the work or the shows that we’ve done as something to be celebrated,” the affected employee says. “We’re being intentionally disregarded in explanations about metrics, and growth, and listenership, and all that kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lK2kgp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc8C0C"&gt;“When you go through a year of that ... where you’re behind the scenes, and you’re creating things, and it just doesn’t get the love or the shine that the other studios get, I think that causes a lot of rightful thoughts to be going through your head of like, ‘Hey, what does the upper echelon of the executive community at Spotify think about the studio, what we’re doing, and how easily could they just sweep it under the rug,’ which they ended up ultimately doing,” the former employee adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HKcWR"&gt;The team most recently produced programming like &lt;em&gt;Nosy Neighbors, We Said What We Said&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Dope Labs&lt;/em&gt;, as well as partner programs like Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s 2020 holiday special. The former employee says that one show, &lt;em&gt;Wind of Change&lt;/em&gt;, was produced under the studio, but was then handed to Gimlet to oversee the next release in the Pineapple Street Studios partnership — &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Your Fantasy. &lt;/em&gt;They say&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;successes were given away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsNvk4"&gt;Since Studio 4’s inception, Spotify spent millions not only buying up new studios and networks, but also securing high-profile deals with big podcasting names like Joe Rogan, Alex Cooper of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534981/spotify-exclusive-podcast-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Dax Shepard of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also focused heavily on its ad technology with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of hosting company Megaphone, which was the centerpiece of most of the company’s announcements this past year. However, Spotify hasn’t shared numbers on how its acquired entities are doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLDnMI"&gt;Though Spotify says more podcasts than ever are on its platform, an August &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-leaked-data-gimlet-podcast-studio-struggled-2021-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; said Gimlet itself has struggled to grow inside the tech company due to “unclear strategy” and “internal tensions.” It had the lowest numbers of all four studios in terms of consumption hours in leaked metrics for September 2020. Meanwhile, a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632213/joe-rogan-experience-spotify-exclusive-audience-reach"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Spotify’s licensed exclusives, Joe Rogan’s show specifically, might have lost a significant chunk of its audience in the move to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6A8gOY"&gt;For now, Spotify hasn’t said how partner programs will be produced moving forward and what will happen to shows currently in production. Original programming will obviously live on within the three networks Spotify bought, but Studio 4’s shutdown shows that Spotify wasn’t able to build a wholly independent production team from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGAaVu"&gt;When asked what the studio’s biggest show was, or what people should know about, the affected employee couldn’t name one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DwS0e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5hq6x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox players are fed up with forced crossplay against PC gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7dXLX2wLXjzQ5_Nh6k8o8gAcvA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373674/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNt15I"&gt;Xbox players are growing increasingly frustrated at being forced to play against PC gamers. While crossplay was initially a popular request from Xbox and PC players that Microsoft has backed strongly for years, those playing first-person shooters on Xbox are struggling to opt out of the experience to avoid PC cheaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sye9V7"&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;force Xbox players to match against PC gamers in a variety of playlists. You don’t have to look very far to see why people are angry about it. “Now that cheating in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; is confirmed on PC, can we have to option to opt out of cross-play?” asked one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/qzkinm/now_that_cheating_in_halo_is_confirmed_on_pc_can/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in November, just weeks after the multiplayer version of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pVCUT"&gt;“Forced crossplay is a scam by Microsoft,” reads another post in &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/forced-crossplay-is-a-scam-by-microsoft/483900"&gt;Microsoft’s Halo Waypoint forums&lt;/a&gt;. “Forced crossplay is a mistake,” says &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/qurwr9/infinite_forced_crossplay_is_a_mistake/"&gt;another Redditor&lt;/a&gt;, and the list &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/qytykn/why_must_we_be_forced_into_crossplay/"&gt;goes on&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/rbcijs/halo_infinite_is_proof_that_sbmm_and_forced/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://xbox-forums.com/threads/microsofts-push-of-forcing-crossplay-between-pc-and-xbox-is-ruining-multiplayer-gaming.466559/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jCrKMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"},{"title":"Cheaters are ruining Call of Duty: Warzone ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem"},{"title":"Call of Duty’s new anti-cheat system includes a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"},{"title":"Cheaters are already ruining Halo Infinite multiplayer games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XmrZMi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; are both suffering from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;influx of cheating&lt;/a&gt;, largely because they’re free-to-play titles so it’s easy for hackers to create a new account following a ban. While there’s an option to disable crossplay in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, if you try to load into a playlist on Xbox it will ask you to re-enable it. Whereas on PlayStation you can simply dismiss the prompt and continue to the playlist with crossplay still disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck7OvZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;players on Xbox have been complaining about this forced crossplay for more than a year, with various &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/call-of-duty-warzone-forced-crossplay/e9682d44-89e9-4c5e-a9ef-55ad6c2c89ea"&gt;forum posts&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/E28PF-UUpTs"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; highlighting how irritating it is to be forced into crossplay. Most of the issues are related to PC cheaters, who have plagued &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; for years before Activision finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;added a new anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt; in October with a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5LuOI"&gt;Now that cheaters are already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"&gt;ruining &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer games&lt;/a&gt;, the call to remove forced crossplay is certainly growing louder. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; players on Xbox are matched against PC gamers in most playlists, and even in ranked modes you have to play solo or as a duo to avoid forced crossplay. If you want to squad up as a team of three or four, you’ll be forced to play against PC players in ranked &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; modes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZPn3O3cDbtbeap2dQKIukioe6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925721/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_25_237.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite is already suffering from an influx of cheaters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ65cM"&gt;Microsoft’s decision to force crossplay in its own &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; title runs against previous commitments from the company’s head of Xbox. “I’ll never force somebody in our games whose playing with a controller or a mouse and keyboard to play against somebody with a different control scheme,” said Xbox chief Phil Spencer in an &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-head-talks-gaming-across-xbox-one-and-pc/1100-6436153/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Gamespot&lt;/em&gt; in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. “Mouse and keyboard rotation speed is faster than controller. We know that, you’ll lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxXFM0"&gt;Nothing has changed in the classic arguments between mouse and keyboard players and controllers. Xbox players simply want the option to be able to opt out of crossplay, and not to have to be forced to play against PC players. A lot of PC players would also like to avoid controller aim assist in games like &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBEwID"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; launched in November with forced crossplay for Xbox players, and an option to disable it for PlayStation owners. In a sign that things can change, Developer DICE was quick to &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-4"&gt;add the option&lt;/a&gt; to disable crossplay for Xbox players just a few weeks after launch. Even Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;, the original darling of crossplay, added an option to disable forced crossplay a few years after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKoWpb"&gt;We reached out to both Microsoft and Activision to comment on the forced crossplay situation, and neither company was willing to issue a statement in time for publication. 343 Industries, the developer behind &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite, &lt;/em&gt;made it clear it’s trying to address the cheating issues in the game yesterday. 343 is hoping to address &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/halo-infinite-update-btb-and-more-jan-10/490385?u=ske7ch"&gt;cheating and “other things”&lt;/a&gt; in a patch in mid-February. 343 won’t be magically fixing cheating issues from its game with a single patch, but here’s hoping there’s an option to avoid most of them next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="20az7S"&gt;Apple says it will introduce third-party payment options for the first time ever in iOS apps,  following South Korean legislation designed to open up the perceived monopolies of Google and Apple’s app stores. The alternative payments will only be available in South Korea and follows the announcement of similar changes by Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QknUEg"&gt;Apple’s decision was shared by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) and reported by &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20220111004700320?input=tw"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but details of the implementation are thin on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFNs7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arguments over payment fees triggered the Epic Games trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0W7ewy"&gt;Apple currently charges developers a 30 percent fee on any digital purchases made by consumers using iOS apps. This fee has become increasingly contentious for developers, and was at the heart of the huge US lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;between Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the lawsuit, a judge ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;allow third-party payments&lt;/a&gt; in the App Store, but this order was later put on hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;due to an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. (Apple has since made a tiny concession to “reader apps” like Netflix, allowing them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;link to websites to sign up users for new accounts&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s nothing like allowing in-app third-party payments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOsnAI"&gt;In South Korea, lawmakers have upheld complaints by developers about in-app payments, leading to new legislation. Apple says its will charge developers a reduced fee to use third-party payment options (just as Google has promised for its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;third-party payment support&lt;/a&gt;), but some developers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1480807630817878020"&gt;say it’s unfair&lt;/a&gt; for these companies to charge any fee at all. Apple and Google say fees are necessary to maintain and promote their app platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43SzGz"&gt;Apple has not said how much it will charge developers to implement third-party payments in South Korea, or when this option will be available, or how exactly these new payments will be made available to consumers. The exact details of the implementation will be vitally important, as seemingly small decisions in things like app store UI can be used to steer consumers one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU1Ya1"&gt;“Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea’s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country’s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love,” Apple told &lt;em&gt;Yonhap &lt;/em&gt;in a press statement. “We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obscenely detailed scan lets you peer at Rembrandt’s Night Watch masterpiece online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJRM5TxLz0rDUJ6K2ogLHSUNHic=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373546/Operation_Night_Watch___Rijksmuseum_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The level of detail is staggering.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rijksmuseum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hpNkdV"&gt;The Rijksmuseum has released what it claims is the “largest and most detailed photograph of any artwork,” and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-photo"&gt;viewable for free on its website&lt;/a&gt;. The scan is of Rembrandt van Rijn’s 1642 masterpiece &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/em&gt;, a roughly 12 by 14 foot painting which is currently the focus of a massive research and restoration project called “Operation Night Watch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbqF0C"&gt;The technical details of the scan are staggering. In a &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/press/press-releases/rijksmuseum-publishes-717-gigapixel-photograph-of-the-night-watch"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Rijksmuseum explains that it’s made up of 8,439 individual photographs taken with a 100 megapixel Hasselblad H6D 400 MS camera. Neural networks were reportedly used to check each image for color and sharpness, and an AI system helped stitch these photos together into a single image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y2s8z"&gt;The result is a 717 gigapixel image that’s 5.6 terabytes in size, where each of its pixels shows an area just 5 micrometers in size on the original painting. The museum notes that it’s four times sharper than the last scan that was put out by the museum, which was &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; 44.8 gigapixels big, and where each pixel represented a comparatively massive 20 micrometers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrRjSLa2KTYlfwxVNUXao0G5mic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160429/Operation_Night_Watch___Rijksmuseum__2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rijksmuseum&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IvjwdM"&gt;The impact is a little mind-boggling, allowing you to zoom in to see the cracks that have appeared in the individual brush strokes of this masterpiece. Arguably it’s an even better experience than seeing the painting in the flesh, since this software allows you to really press your nose up against it in a way that would get you thrown out of most museums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7ulKE"&gt;If you’re willing to sacrifice a bit of resolution, then the website also has an &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/night-watch-including-missing-pieces"&gt;alternative version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch &lt;/em&gt;with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548402/rembrandt-night-watch-uncropped-artificial-intelligence-rijksmuseum"&gt;missing cropped sides&lt;/a&gt; restored. These sections were stripped from the painting in 1715, allowing it to fit in a more cramped location in Amsterdam’s City Hall. These missing segments were restored last year based on a 17th-century copy of the original painting made by Gerrit Lundens. This work was also completed as part of the same Operation Night Watch project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="525OyY"&gt;The Rijksmuseum’s press release notes that this scan will help with research of the painting, especially remotely. It should also allow researchers to track how the painting ages going forward with more accuracy. With the scan complete, the museum notes that it now plans to mount &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/em&gt; onto a new stretcher to correct deformities in the canvas that have appeared, and that it will consider other “conservation treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOeTDR"&gt;The high resolution scan of &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-photo"&gt;viewable here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/night-watch-including-missing-pieces"&gt;version with its missing sides is here&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s got you in the mood for looking at more high-resolution scans of classic works of art, check out this 10 gigapixel scan of &lt;a href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/"&gt;Johannes Vermeer’s &lt;em&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s funding threatened by Marco Rubio after ‘humiliating apologies’ to China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2019 ChinaJoy In Shanghai" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lv2Pmwe2gIPLHKM-YfqSMQKyUQQ=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373467/1165707843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a31M0j"&gt;US Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has threatened the government funding of chipmaker Intel after the company made what Rubio described as “humiliating apologies” to China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mj86fj"&gt;Intel issued apologies to its Chinese partners and the Chinese public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods#comments"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; after it noted in a routine letter to suppliers that it would not use “labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.” This stipulation is &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2021/12/23/biden-signs-the-uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act-into-law/"&gt;required by US law&lt;/a&gt; as part of trading sanctions against China for its ongoing persecution of the Xinjiang region’s Uyghur population (which the US government has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/trump-china-xinjiang.html"&gt;designated a genocide&lt;/a&gt;). Intel’s letter to suppliers, though, went viral in China, and caused a huge public backlash against the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNyJtR"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods#"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last year, Intel not only issued public apologies but also deleted all references to Xinjiang on its website. When asked about this deletion, Intel’s senior director of corporate comms, William Moss, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We amended some language based on concerns from stakeholders to focus on broadly and globally applicable principles and policies, consistent with our general practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3B65"&gt;In response to Intel’s actions, Rubio &lt;a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=D0696334-4F97-413F-B7CB-E45AE5DF0625"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Monday: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="njANRu"&gt;“Intel’s cowardice is yet another predictable consequence of economic reliance on China. Instead of humiliating apologies and self-censorship, companies should move their supply chains to countries that do not use slave labor or commit genocide. If companies like Intel continue to obscure the facts about US law just to appease the Chinese Communist Party then they should be ineligible for any funding under the CHIPS Act.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ugxEvn"&gt;The CHIPS Act is a reaction to the global shortage of semiconductors and the United States’ dwindling ability to manufacture these vital components. CHIPS was enacted last year as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062192097/house-passes-ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act"&gt;annual military funding bill&lt;/a&gt; (the National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA), with the Senate authorizing $52 billion in federal investments to go to “domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing provisions.” However, that funding is only speculative as of right now, as despite broad bipartisan backing the legislation is &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/chips-manufacturing-congress-subsidy"&gt;currently stalled in Congress&lt;/a&gt;. That means Rubio’s threat to Intel is, itself, only hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Redownload your Harry Potter e-books from Pottermore before they disappear for good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HDtZaV-StBEChlLYHYap5Uu0jQ=/0x1:1277x852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373453/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_9.09.22_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An email sent to customers warning them about the change.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pottermore&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBNziK"&gt;If you own digital Harry Potter books purchased on Pottermore, you might want to redownload your copies before the option disappears for good at the end of the month. The site is emailing its customers to warn them that the books will no longer be available to redownload after January 31st, since being removed from sale in September last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwyWkM"&gt;When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7928325/harry-potter-ebook-oyster-subsciption-service"&gt;launched back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Pottermore was the only official way to download digital copies of the Harry Potter books. Despite big stores like Amazon running promotions for the titles, which are some of the best-selling books of all time, stores would funnel customers to Pottermore to complete the sale (retailers like Amazon reportedly still got a cut, however). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TZIUKa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey, remember when they forced Amazon to require users to buy e-books through Pottermore to read Harry Potter on a Kindle? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bj6ydScp5S"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bj6ydScp5S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan C. Gordon (@icculus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1479635293099671555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v7wJtL"&gt;But sales of the e-books &lt;a href="https://www.scotsman.com/regions/harry-potter-digital-arm-loses-ps6m-and-sheds-jobs-2461743"&gt;reportedly declined over the years&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2015 they were made available directly from other online stores. Digitally enhanced editions launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9477815/harry-potter-apple-ibooks-enhanced-edition"&gt;Apple’s e-books store in October 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and releases on other digital stores like Amazon followed later that year. Pottermore eventually &lt;a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/a-new-wizarding-world-website"&gt;morphed into WizardingWorld.com&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vo3loS"&gt;Although the option to redownload existing book purchases from Pottermore will disappear for good at the end of the month, it shouldn’t be too hard to hold on to your existing digital copy. On Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1479637303433867272"&gt;Ryan C. Gordon notes&lt;/a&gt; that existing downloads consist of a DRM-free .epub file, which you should be able to transfer to any new e-readers in the future (though you have to &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/ebook-readers/41944/how-to-put-free-ebooks-on-your-amazon-kindle"&gt;convert the .epub file&lt;/a&gt; to make it readable on a Kindle). Just be sure to stash the file somewhere safe if you don’t want to pay again for books you already own in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Pumped gets a new, longer teaser with more Uber shenanigans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAghgQjZ0KftSAQtBmgzNQYE4X4=/398x0:2129x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372719/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_17.09.58.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Travis Kalanick in the show’s first season.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T9tNdD"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfuFRgGVM8U"&gt;a new teaser&lt;/a&gt; for the first season of &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, Showtime’s upcoming anthology show about Silicon Valley startups that hit it big. As we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/12/23/22851481/uber-showtime-series-super-pumped-trailer-joseph-gordon-levitt"&gt;in the teaser from December&lt;/a&gt;, season one will revolve around Uber and its former CEO Travis Kalanick, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOWKPE"&gt;The show’s first story will be based on the book that’s also named &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, which was written by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mike Issac. It’ll follow the, in the trailer’s words, “wild, loud, cocky, shady, reckless, excessive, ridiculous, damaging, outrageous” story of Uber’s founder, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15844836/uber-ceo-resigns-travis-kalanick"&gt;resigned from his role as CEO in 2017&lt;/a&gt; after investors demanded change following a series of controversies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uy6gqz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfuFRgGVM8U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZFa10"&gt;This new trailer contains some quotable moments, including one where someone asks “is this legal?” and is met with laughter. Then, there’s the line delivered by Kyle Chandler, who plays early Uber investor and former board member Bill Gurley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6iKq8Y"&gt;The best thing about Travis is that he is willing to run through walls to win. The worst thing about him is he thinks everything is a wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ivxsxJ"&gt;And, of course, there’s the line delivered by Gordon-Levitt himself, where he name-drops the show. “Are we super pumped?” he yells at a cheering crowd. If you’re super... excited for the show, it premieres on February 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

That will hopefully soon be a thing of the past: developer 343 says it’s not only aware, it believes it has “a fix in hand for the core issue” and will release a special hotfix specifically for it. “It’s a little too soon to give an ETA yet but please know our goal is to release this as soon as we can,” &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/halo-infinite-update-btb-and-more-jan-10/490385?u=ske7ch"&gt;write the developers in an official blog post&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that “It won’t be this week, but we hope it’s not too much further out and we’ll share an update as soon as we have line of sight on a release date (once we clear ‘cert’ we are then ready to ship).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vmuwV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is the best thing that’s happened to me and my gaming buddies in years. It doesn’t matter how many people are down, it doesn’t matter if they’re on PC or console, and it doesn’t cost a cent — the game’s free cross-platform Big Team Battle multiplayer mode lets &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of us dive into an epic game filled with plasma explosions, grappling hooks, nail-biting gunplay and vehicular mayhem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FE1Ge"&gt;Theoretically, anyway. Most of the time we’re twiddling our thumbs, waiting for a match to load, only for Microsoft’s servers to spontaneously disconnect (or even ban) a couple members of our fireteam because the matchmaking service can’t seem to connect the dots — and doing that again and again until we magically luck out. Yesterday evening, we finally made one of our friends the fireteam leader and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; got six of us together in matches, but even then the servers split some of us up with randos instead of friends. Once one of us quit for the evening, another player weirdly didn’t make it into the game. When we quit in solidarity, our fireteam leader got banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q93Dp2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cheaters are already ruining Halo Infinite multiplayer games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"},{"title":"Halo Infinite’s creators say your wildest stunts are part of the series’ DNA","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22827053/halo-infinite-developers-wild-stunts-series-dna"},{"title":"Halo Infinite campaign review: playing the hits","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ml2zHH"&gt;Can’t wait for this to get fixed! Most of my group’s favorite multiplayer games require precisely 3, 4 or 6 players to work properly, so Halo’s been a breath of fresh air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwSy2"&gt;343 says it’s also planning on a second patch in mid-February that should address “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"&gt;some issues with instances of cheating&lt;/a&gt;” and possibly “wonkiness with the ranked experience” among other things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCQ6eZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; already added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829744/halo-infinite-playlists-slayer"&gt;some additional multiplayer playlists&lt;/a&gt; for four-player fireteams; I’m hoping once the Big Team Battle bugs are worked out, we can get some more variety in 12-player games, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jeGIxq"&gt;Meta, the parent company of Facebook, will require staffers to have received a COVID-19 booster shot to be able to work from its US offices, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-owner-to-mandate-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-for-office-workers-delay-reopening-11641852001?st=dpc5i90mrknpv99&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meta had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;already said&lt;/a&gt; that US office employees would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when they returned to the office, but beginning March 28th, they’ll also need proof of a booster vaccine, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company is also delaying its full office reopening until March 28th, pushing back a return that had been previously set for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-will-offer-office-deferral-program-for-employees-unready-to-return-11638920387?mod=article_inline"&gt;the end of this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EustQ8"&gt;Not all Meta employees will have to return to the office on March 28th. Those who want to come back can defer their return by three to five months, a policy that was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/rto-meta-lyft-delayed"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also letting staffers request &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;to work remotely full time&lt;/a&gt;. Employees will now have until March 14th to decide if they want to come back to the office, defer their return, or request full time remote work, Clayton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5ysKAQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes are being announced as COVID-19 case counts are surging across the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HR2mKi"&gt;The changes are being announced as COVID-19 case counts &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/01/09/us-case-count-live-covid-updates/9146794002/"&gt;are surging across the US&lt;/a&gt;, forcing companies and organizations to shift their plans for in-person gatherings. The rising cases caused many companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;pull their physical presences from this year’s CES&lt;/a&gt;, and the conference itself was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/31/22861669/ces-2022-ends-early-covid-january-7"&gt;closed a day early&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, both the Grammy Awards and the Sundance Film Festival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22869140/grammys-sundance-film-festival-postponed-virtual-omicron-coronavirus"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt;; the Grammys have been postponed due in part to concerns about the omicron variant, while Sundance canceled the in-person programming for its 2022 event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InWd7Z"&gt;Other big tech companies have also recently shifted their office reopening plans. Apple indefinitely delayed its return to work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838471/apple-delays-office-reopening-date-covid-19"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, pushing back a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;previously-set February 1st reopening&lt;/a&gt;. Google had planned to keep in-office work voluntary until today, January 10th, but the company pushed that back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, saying it would wait until 2022 to make more return to office plans. Microsoft gave up predicting an office reopening date &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664284/microsoft-office-reopening-plans-us"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721096/amazon-work-from-home-policy-teams-decide-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that it would let individual teams decide when they would return to offices.&lt;/p&gt;
