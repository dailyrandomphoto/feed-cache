    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hvSkHC"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 12 mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone with high-end features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gfmz0Z"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G is our current pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;best Android phone under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also worth highlighting here for its combination of features usually reserved for premium devices and a reasonable price. You won’t get all the bells and whistles of the S21 series phones, of course, but the A52 5G includes a 6.5-inch screen with fast 120Hz refresh rate, an IP67 water resistance rating, and (for now, at least) access to monthly bug fixes and security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl0lbP"&gt;The A52 5G delivers on the basics too. Its Snapdragon 750G processor isn’t the fastest in the game but it keeps up well with day-to-day tasks. Its 4,500mAh battery delivers well over a day of moderate to heavy use. And the phone supports sub-6GHz 5G, which will allow it to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5qamU"&gt;Then there’s the typically Samsung-y stuff, including a UI that’s currently trending toward over-cluttered with the occasional unwelcome ad. The phone’s camera hardware is good, though photos tend to look a little oversaturated, which may or may not suit your taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the phone’s best features is Samsung’s commitment to providing four years of security updates. Overall, it’s a relatively affordable device with a solid feature set that should keep up for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGSyayDrR2mXPWMiM9i0d_4YCk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691996/vpavic_200728_4113_0127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $400&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $400. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Actor says TikTok used her voice without permission for viral text-to-speech feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vB1U-TKC2t7e8izTrWgG-998d-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284099/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T8Evsm"&gt;TikTok is being sued by a voice actor who claims to be behind its viral text-to-speech feature, but says she never authorized TikTok — or just about anyone, really — to use her voice this way. The lawsuit, filed last week, says Bev Standing’s voice has been used to repeat “foul and offensive language” and that TikTok’s use will cause her “irreparable harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHFPmi"&gt;It’s unclear how Standing’s voice could have come to be used by TikTok, at least by the lawsuit’s telling. Standing says that she did voice recordings for a text-to-speech feature “several years ago” for a group called the Institute of Acoustics (IOA). Those recordings were meant to be used for translations of Chinese texts as part of a contract with an unnamed Chinese company, the lawsuit says. Standing says she did not authorize the IOA to transfer her voice data to other parties for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQgsh8"&gt;(It is unclear which IOA the lawsuit is referring to: a Google search reveals two groups with the same name — one based in England and another based in China. The lawsuit says it is based in “Edenborough Scotland;” the capital of Scotland is Edinburgh.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RYJuPE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Text-to-speech has been hugely popular on TikTok&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wfzUuD"&gt;Fast forward to the end of 2020, and Standing discovers that her voice seemed to have become a viral sensation online. A new feature gave creators the ability to have text written on their videos read aloud by a digital voice. If you’ve used TikTok for even a few minutes since the feature was released, you’ve likely come across a video with a calm, vaguely robotic woman’s voice narrating some text. (Standing says she discovered her voice was being used in November 2020, although TikTok does not appear to have publicly announced the feature until December 2020.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOIZSU"&gt;While the feature has made Standing’s voice far more recognizable, that could also be a drawback for her as an actor who does work for commercials, radio, and other client videos. “No matter what I do, I believe this is going to affect my business,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ftechnology%2F2021%2F05%2F09%2Fvoice-tiktok-sues-company-emotional-distress%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22435058%2Ftiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;she told &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCVsEE"&gt;TikTok hasn’t commented on the lawsuit. A representative told &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;it does not comment on ongoing litigation. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reached out to TikTok and both IOAs for comment. The lawsuit seeks to stop TikTok from using her voice and to pay her for its existing usage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get an unlocked Google Pixel 3 for $160 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFj59s7JBVL0bYJjCB6kT3SYJbI=/0x0:1720x1147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283574/Google_Pixel_3_Front_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fv8hjQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Google Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; was one of the best Android phones of 2018, and though it might not be the showstopper it once was, it’s a standout if you can find it for the right price. Thankfully, if you’re looking to upgrade or take the plunge into the Android ecosystem, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=UnlockedGooglePixel3Woot051321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3-64gb-unlocked%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_el" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is currently offering&lt;/a&gt; a 64GB, unlocked version of the Pixel 3 for $160 — a discount of $240.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvEh6q"&gt;Despite its age, the Pixel 3 remains more than capable with its Snapdragon 845 processor. The phone lacks a headphone jack and its bezels aren’t exactly small, but it packs a 5.5-inch OLED display and a terrific 12-megapixel rear camera, one capable of capturing vibrant shots and decent low-light photos. The Pixel 3’s dual front-facing cameras even churn out wide-angle selfies, while its support for wireless charging makes it one of the cheapest phones outside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22425011/zte-blade-11-prime-review-price-specs-screen"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime&lt;/a&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N2Vpz4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu6NGw"&gt;Right now, Woot is selling the pink Verizon model, however, it’s compatible with most other US carriers, including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;despite Google discontinuing the Pixel 3 in March&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will continue to receive software updates — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — through October 2021. If you’re looking for a budget phone and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still outside your price range, it’s hard to go wrong with the Google Pixel 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s return to theaters will include a shorter 45-day theatrical window</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wa5t3Xw0gnJmL5AFr6m1smH-l2g=/192x0:833x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283539/Screenshot_1160_1024x427.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eh12Rv"&gt;Disney has confirmed that its upcoming releases &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; will be the company’s first two films to debut exclusively in theaters (on August 13th and September 3rd, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev4ZCj"&gt;But when they do hit theaters, it’ll be for a far shorter amount of time, with just 45 days of theatrical exclusivity, instead of the traditional 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vr9c6x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorter windows are the new standard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KosEC"&gt;The studio is by no means the only one: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;Warner Bros. has already announced&lt;/a&gt; that its return to theaters in 2022 will feature a 45-day window; Paramount has said that upcoming blockbuster films like &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;will get 45-day windows&lt;/a&gt;, while smaller movies will have &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficepro.com/paramount-cuts-down-theatrical-exclusivity-for-major-titles-to-30-45-day-window/"&gt;an even shorter 30-day window&lt;/a&gt;. And Universal has signed deals with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wall-street-is-reacting-to-cinemark-universal-theatrical-window-deal"&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt;: smaller movies (with openings less than $50 million domestically) can hit paid video services after a 17-day window, while bigger films (that open to bigger numbers) can hit paid video services after 31 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6YxoM"&gt;It’s a move that makes a lot of sense for all of these companies: even the biggest movies in the world tend to make the bulk of their money theatrically in the first few weekends, and the longer that films are kept exclusive to theaters, the longer companies like Disney and WarnerMedia have to wait before they can get them through the usual paid video windows and onto streaming services like Disney Plus and HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv18MT"&gt;And that’s really the name of the game now: release big blockbusters theatrically, cash in on those massive opening weekends, and then rush them to streaming where they can be used to help bolster a service’s library, attracting new subscribers and giving existing ones more reasons to stay subscribed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7xIHP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will make it easier to search your DMs, finally adds DM search to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3OvFtCaTXrjYMHffJRuCCEXk1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283494/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TcgMK"&gt;Can you imagine being able to actually &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; Twitter to find a conversation, instead of just scrolling through endlessly to hopefully find what you’re looking for? That could be a reality for Twitter DMs in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HamauA"&gt;First off, the company’s finally &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1392924451705024512"&gt;bringing a DM search bar to Android today&lt;/a&gt;, nearly two years after it first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893603/twitter-dm-search-launch-apple-iphone-ios-text"&gt;appeared on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly, it’s going to drastically expand how helpful that bar is by surfacing older conversations and even actual words you’ve typed in those conversations sometime “later this year.” (Currently, you can only search for the names of the people you’ve spoken to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQs4u5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve brought the DM search bar to Android and are rolling out an improved version that lets you search for all of your old convos, not just the most recent ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waiting for the option to search your DMs for message content? We’re working on releasing that later this year! &lt;a href="https://t.co/wAQxSokJt6"&gt;https://t.co/wAQxSokJt6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1392924451705024512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vS5M2K"&gt;Frankly, I’ve rarely ever bothered to try Twitter search on mobile, since I’ve largely been an Android guy — and because Twitter’s mobile search doesn’t give you anywhere near the power of Tweetdeck or Twitter’s advanced search on desktop web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqFdTU"&gt;Speaking of which, here’s an easy way to find your own tweets: drop https://twitter.com/search?q=&lt;strong&gt;YOURSEARCHQUERY&lt;/strong&gt;%20(from%3A&lt;strong&gt;YOURTWITTERNAME&lt;/strong&gt;)&amp;amp;src=typed_query in your web browser, and see what you get. That’d be a nice feature on mobile, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UpWq7G"&gt;An Oregon man who authorities say stole and resold customers’ credentials for Netflix and other streaming services has been indicted on fraud charges, the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/beaverton-man-indicted-streaming-service-fraud-scheme"&gt;US Attorney’s office announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXiGk7"&gt;According to the indictment, Samuel Joyner and Evan McMahon stole and sold more than 200,000 customer account credentials — for streaming services including Netflix, HBO Max, and Spotify Premium — as part of the operation of an online service called AccountBot. Users of the site paid a subscription fee to obtain others’ credentials for paid streaming services at a lower rate than the services charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ESlfe"&gt;As of March 2019, the service allegedly had some 52,000 customers and offered more than 217,000 stolen streaming account credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDLCF9"&gt;AccountBot allegedly obtained those credentials through hacking. The indictment alleges that the two men used credential stuffing attacks — essentially taking login details from public breaches and reusing the information on other sites. Such attacks often work because people reuse the same passwords and usernames on many sites. Joyner and McMahon used an automated tool to verify the stolen credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E1VJw"&gt;AccountBot customers paid between $1.79 and $24.99 for access to the stolen credentials, depending on how long and which service they wanted to access. The DOJ says McMahon managed payments and coded the AccountBot website, while Joyner acquired the stolen credentials and handled AccountBot customer service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOlNqg"&gt;Netflix and other streaming services have &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/the-black-market-for-netflix-accounts/462321/"&gt;dealt with a variety of password-stealing schemes&lt;/a&gt; and other scams for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325831/netflix-password-sharing-test-feature-piracy-security-streaming-video"&gt;Netflix announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; it was trying to crack down on password-sharing among its customers; even if you’re only sharing account access with people you know, the more people who have the info, the greater the chances that info could be compromised. According to analysis from research firm Parks Associates, password piracy and sharing &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/01/13/password-sharing-denies-streaming-services-9-billion-in-fees-report/"&gt;cost streaming services&lt;/a&gt; like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus $9 billion a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqGgFr"&gt;McMahon was prosecuted for similar offenses in the District Court of New South Wales in Sydney, according to the DOJ, and last month was sentenced to two years and two months by way of &lt;a href="https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/intensive_correction_orders.html"&gt;intensive corrections order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCGP5U"&gt;Joyner is charged with conspiracy to commit computer and access device fraud, trafficking and use of unauthorized access devices, and possession of more than 15 unauthorized access devices. He was arrested Wednesday by the FBI and pleaded not guilty at an arraignment before a US magistrate judge. He’s scheduled to stand trial on the charges July 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ir04O"&gt;The charges of conspiracy to commit computer and access device fraud carry a max sentence of five years in federal prison. Trafficking and use of unauthorized access devices and possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices are each punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>From Texas to Hawaii: SpaceX plans first orbital Starship test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOFVc3Yx4o722XDL2orWyGXvW4w=/157x0:1837x1120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283259/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_4.20.02_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omFyRY"&gt;SpaceX plans to have its first Starship test flight to orbit launch from Texas and splash down off the coast of an island in Hawaii, according to a document the company filed with the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday. The orbital flight test would mark the first time SpaceX stacks both elements of its massive Starship system together, the next key development step in its attempt to build a rocket that could one day land on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPi0W6"&gt;As outlined in the &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=273481&amp;amp;x="&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, a super heavy booster stage will launch Starship from SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas, facilities and separate in midair nearly three minutes into flight. About five minutes later,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that booster stage will return back to Earth and splash down in the Gulf of Mexico — or as SpaceX puts it: it will “perform a partial return and land in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 20 miles from the shore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9H97E"&gt;Meanwhile, Starship (the top half of the entire rocket system) will continue into orbit, nearly completing a full trip around Earth before plunging back through the atmosphere over Hawaii roughly 90 minutes after launching from Texas. Starship will aim to nail a “powered, targeted landing” on the ocean about 62 miles off the northwest coast of Kauai, the state’s northernmost island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/grdpuhr9PuJkfVVgYuHfhSaW7ps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512981/May_13_2021_17_04_07.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A Starship prototype in March carries out its complex landing-flip maneuver before attempting to land — a technique similar to how it would land off the coast of Hawaii.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ELJrxt"&gt;The document didn’t name a specific date for Starship’s orbital flight. CEO Elon Musk and SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell have said it could happen by the end of 2021, but an email that accompanied Thursday’s filing indicated it could happen any time in the next year, before March 1st, 2022. That email also says the maximum altitude for Starship is 72 miles — an extremely low orbital altitude sitting just north of the boundary between space and Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqOop2"&gt;SpaceX’s Starship system is the centerpiece of Musk’s goal to enable routine interplanetary travel. The system, designed to send humans and up to 100 tons of cargo to the Moon and Mars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;recently won&lt;/a&gt; a $2.9 billion contract to serve as NASA’s first ride to the Moon carrying astronauts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;since 1972. SpaceX has launched five high-altitude Starship prototypes from its south Texas rocket facilities since December, nailing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421845/spacex-starship-sn15-successful-landing"&gt;successful landing on its fifth test flight&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. A few more of those suborbital “hop” tests are planned in the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Mde9y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“SpaceX intends to collect as much data as possible during flight”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z1pUtC"&gt;Whenever it happens, the orbital test will demonstrate Starship maneuvers that can’t be simulated using computers, SpaceX says in the document. “SpaceX intends to collect as much data as possible during flight to quantify entry dynamics and better understand what the vehicle experiences in a flight regime that is extremely difficult to accurately predict or replicate computationally.” The flight data gleaned from Starship’s test “will anchor any changes in vehicle design... and build better models for us to use in our internal simulations,” SpaceX said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkWv4Y"&gt;Musk has envisioned using Starship for rapid orbit-based transportation between any two cities on Earth, an ambitious (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16385026/elon-musk-spacex-rocket-transportation-point-to-point"&gt;pretty wild&lt;/a&gt;) idea called point-to-point travel. A Starship trip (Startrip?) between New York and London, for example, would take an hour. The 90-minute trip from Texas to Hawaii somewhat mirrors the idea, though it’s just a test, and it’s been a while since SpaceX or Musk have discussed any updates on point-to-point travel plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRI7jL"&gt;With its new Moon lander contract from NASA — which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;stirred quite&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;bit of FOMO&lt;/a&gt; in the space industry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;likely to NASA’s ire&lt;/a&gt; — SpaceX is racing to test Starship for deep-space missions with a deadline to put humans on the lunar surface by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maybe it’s time for a HomePod fire sale, Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="holding a homepod" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W178FenhVLLHbLNbygw413fhIt0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283215/jbareham_180202_2266_0295.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0KzKs9"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/12/homepod-still-available-for-purchase-two-months-after-being-discontinued/"&gt;been some buzz recently&lt;/a&gt; about how Apple is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-is-still-struggling-to-unload-its-launch-day-home-1846877912"&gt;having problems getting rid of its HomePods&lt;/a&gt;, with the now-discontinued Siri speakers still being on sale two months after Apple announced their discontinuation. And yet, the speakers are still $300, which is only slightly lower than their launch price of $350. Apple: it’s time to put them on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRsOh9"&gt;Here’s an anecdote to show how hard it’s been for Apple to unload these things: I bought a HomePod &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;the day its discontinuation was announced&lt;/a&gt;. An online tool tells me that it was made in October 2017, which was before Apple even started selling them in January 2018. That’s pretty rough, especially given that it’s a “space gray” one, seemingly the more popular of the two colors given that the white ones are &lt;em&gt;still available &lt;/em&gt;from Apple’s website. The same thing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DetroitBORG/status/1372259697135386631?s=20"&gt;also happened to tech YouTuber DetroitBORG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6D693TByx_m5JUHMgFu92XQHno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512738/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_12.43.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s so in stock I could have one delivered by the time this article goes up for less than $10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X4h05F"&gt;Listen, Apple. I know that selling these things off for $200, or even $150, would pretty much be admitting defeat, but these things are still in stock two months after they were discontinued. It’s a great speaker, but at $300, it just doesn’t make sense given its complete lack of inputs that aren’t powered by Siri or AirPlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grgtjw"&gt;Fire sales always get people excited: just today, a few of my colleagues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1392834164639031302?s=20"&gt;started pining for a Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;Microsoft slashed its price&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1392834606479642629?s=20"&gt;even though they’ve heard&lt;/a&gt; all about how painful it is to use). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/08/19/hp-drops-touchpad-price-stone-good-luck-snapping-buy-99"&gt;the famous HP Touchpad&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet which was flatly ignored until HP took the price from $399 to $99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lie0F"&gt;I most certainly don’t need another HomePod, but if there was one last hoorah sale that made it a reasonable price, I might forget that for a moment and buy one for my office. But Apple, please: it’s obvious you didn’t care enough for this speaker while it was alive. Just do something, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to finally close the loop. Put it on sale, “accidentally” include one with AirTag orders, whatever. Just let it go gently into that dark night, with no stock left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Italian authorities fine Google $120 million for   an Android Auto issue that’s already solved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSAqN2RP-P6Cn5FMzjnDU5sOo9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282775/akrales_190725_3567_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfg0Dw"&gt;The Italian Competition Authority (ICA) &lt;a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2021/5/A529"&gt;handed Google&lt;/a&gt; an approximately $120 million (€100 million) fine today for not letting a third-party charging app on Android Auto in 2019 (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/13/google-android-auto-fine-italy/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The case started with a probe into the search giant’s automotive software business, which &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/10/introducing-android-for-cars-app-library.html"&gt;until October 2020&lt;/a&gt; had limitations around what kinds of apps were allowed to be developed and released for use while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBvnS6"&gt;Enel Group, an Italian energy company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629912/google-android-auto-italy-antitrust-probe-enel-group"&gt;originally complained&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that Google wouldn’t allow its Enel X Recharge app on Android Auto. The app can help find charging locations for electric cars, a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17983986/google-maps-electric-car-charging-tesla-superchargers"&gt;Google first added to Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. Today’s ICA fine is focused on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enelx.com%2Fro%2Fen%2Felectric-mobility%2Fproducts%2Fprivates%2Fjuicepass-app&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22434373%2Fitalian-antitrust-fine-google-android-auto-enel-x-juicepass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Enel X JuicePass&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enelx.com%2Fit%2Fen%2Fnews-media%2Fnotizie%2F2019%2F07%2Fapp-enelx-juicepass-new-name-new-energy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22434373%2Fitalian-antitrust-fine-google-android-auto-enel-x-juicepass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the renamed version&lt;/a&gt; of the same app with the same EV features. Along with the fine, the ICA is ordering Google to open up Android Auto to more developers (something the company has already done) and let Enel Group onto the platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lV81Ml"&gt;The Authority has therefore ordered Google to make available to Enel X Italia, as well as to other app developers, tools for the programming of apps that are interoperable with Android Auto and will monitor the effective and correct implementation of the imposed obligations through an independent expert to whom Google must provide all cooperation and information requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe44Ug"&gt;Before changing what apps it allows, Google required Android Auto apps to include some kind of messaging or media playback option, and limited navigation to Waze and Google Maps. Since the company changed course, similar charging apps to JuicePass, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409310/chargepoint-android-auto-electric-vehicle-charging-network"&gt;like ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;, have launched on the platform, seemingly without any issues. Since the ICA began its investigation before Google eased up its restrictions, there’s a possibility Enel’s complaints helped motivate the change in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sqqyU"&gt;For its part, Google says it disagrees with the ICA’s decision and provided this statement in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ro12BR"&gt;The number one priority for Android Auto is to ensure apps can be used safely while driving. That’s why we have strict guidelines on the types of apps which are currently supported and these are based on driver-distraction tests and regulatory and industry standards. Thousands of applications are already compatible with Android Auto, and our goal is to allow even more developers to make their apps available over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sMDVkE"&gt;The company also says that Enel is able to integrate its app into Android Auto using one of the &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/04/start-your-engines-launch-new-android.html"&gt;navigation or booking templates&lt;/a&gt; it already provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2BFd"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150166/android-auto-expands-countries-europe-africa-asia"&gt;Android Auto becomes more common&lt;/a&gt; and Google develops direct relationships with European automakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;like Volvo for Android Automotive&lt;/a&gt;, the concern that the company wields too much control over its platform isn’t ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Renewable energy won’t make Elon Musk love bitcoin again</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GuAl4W"&gt;Elon Musk shouldn’t hold his breath waiting for bitcoin to become environmentally friendly enough for Tesla to take it as payment. Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that Tesla was walking away from the cryptocurrency because of the fossil fuels used for bitcoin mining and transactions. In the announcement, he left the door open for Tesla to accept bitcoin again if mining the cryptocurrency eventually runs on “more sustainable energy.” But some experts caution that renewable energy is not a silver bullet for bitcoin’s sustainability problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="u8w3gz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Alex de Vries, a digital currency economist who has consistently called out bitcoin’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. He runs the blog &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digiconomist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps a running tab on bitcoin’s estimated energy use and emissions. While some other &lt;a href="https://www.coincenter.org/estimating-bitcoin-electricity-use-a-beginners-guide/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373524/cryptocurrency-climate-accord-bitcoin-carbon-footprint"&gt;blockchain enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt; have been more optimistic about the potential for renewable energy to slash bitcoin’s emissions, de Vries has &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30087-X"&gt;published papers&lt;/a&gt; arguing that the climate calculations just don’t add up. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with de Vries about why he’s still skeptical about bitcoin going green through renewables, other ways the cryptocurrency could cut its pollution, and how bitcoin compares to alternatives like Dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Q87I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVO7g0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have any reaction to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;news in February&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that Tesla was going to accept bitcoin for payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTgJMw"&gt;I was shocked at the time because bitcoin isn’t an ESG-friendly currency. We know that a big part of the mining is done by using Chinese coal; that’s something that isn’t new information. Mining itself is a really big lottery where the machines that are participating are just generating useless computations all the time so they’re literally wasting resources for making new blocks for this blockchain. It’s really weird that a company that has a mission statement that involves decarbonizing the planet gets involved with a currency that ultimately involves the waste of natural resources, specifically fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xJn0Ne"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was shocked at the time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVoCkz"&gt;The bitcoin network is responsible for 55 million metric tons of CO2 annually, which is as much as a nation like Singapore. Ironically, it’s also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digieconomist/status/1389521169657868288?s=21"&gt;more than the entire estimated net gains from deploying electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUuzNj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your reaction to yesterday’s news that Elon decided to backtrack on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvH4Os"&gt;Well, my initial response was better late than never. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rx4f4"&gt;In his statement, Elon Musk says that they’re doing this because of an increasing amount of fossil fuels used for bitcoin mining. Now in all honesty, there hasn’t been that much change. Let’s be real, Tesla announced that it would accept bitcoin two months ago, and not that much has changed since then. The total amount of resources going into the network has gone up by a bit, but we already knew that was primarily Chinese coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7G1jk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting that Musk says Tesla will go back to bitcoin “as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.” Do you think that can happen? Why or why not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd85Lc"&gt;In all honesty, it makes no sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P77109"&gt;In the past few years, miners have only been getting renewables from the south of China, that has been their only major source of renewables. And it doesn’t last. It lasts for only four months a year and because the production is seasonal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uFFjYz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In all honesty, it makes no sense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGtDj7"&gt;That’s the problem with renewable energy sources in general: they can’t provide these machines with 24/7 power all year long. For example, it was recently argued that &lt;a href="https://github.com/ARKInvest/SolarBatteryBitcoin"&gt;miners could be using solar power&lt;/a&gt; for bitcoin mining, which sounds like a great idea. But if you read what should happen to do that, bitcoin miners would need to be shut down during half the day in order to make that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6x9ji"&gt;That makes no sense if you’re an investor in these machines, because you’re paying a whole lot of money for a device that the moment you get, it starts becoming obsolete. If you miss out on half a day, you’re missing out on a level of income that’s just never going to come back. You want to have these machines running 24/7 if you want to maximize your profit, which is a lot easier if you’re running on Chinese coal than if you’re running on solar power for half a day — so there’s no real incentive to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUH2vS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You published a paper that argued that renewable energy will not solve bitcoin’s sustainability problem — can you walk me through why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjHCt4"&gt;A big amount of bitcoin miners can always cause problems no matter what type of energy they’re using. It can lead to outages if mining becomes really popular in the particular spot. What also might be happening is that you’re using renewable energy that you could have used a different way to clean up the grid elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMJjUV"&gt;Even if, hypothetically speaking, this whole network was running on renewable energy. Still, it doesn’t solve the sustainability issues of bitcoin. Bitcoin uses excessive amounts of hardware. You have a bunch of specialized equipment that can only do bitcoin mining. The moment they become unprofitable, there’s nothing you can do with them. You can’t repurpose them, you can’t use them as a home computer. It’s trash. And they don’t last very long, on average maybe one and a half years. So you’ve got millions of devices that are becoming obsolete extremely fast. That just results in a big pile of electronic waste down the line. It’s already the case that a single bitcoin transaction is equivalent to throwing away an iPhone 12 mini in terms of materials, that’s already how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lqJaE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there better solutions to bitcoin’s sustainability problem? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUYCEB"&gt;The good thing is that Elon Musk did mention the alternative cryptocurrencies that don’t have the same environmental impact. This is a very important point because the energy consumption issue in bitcoin relates to the proof of work algorithm. That is a specific part of the bitcoin software that is not necessarily present in alternative cryptocurrencies because there’s different ways to do the block creation process. In bitcoin, it depends on computational power, but there are alternatives. Proof of stake is the most popular one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pus0uh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cryptocurrencies that don’t have the same environmental impact&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="duZu1x"&gt;The second largest cryptocurrency of the moment, Ethereum, is right now running proof of work but is planning to change that to proof of stake. What that does is it makes the block creation process depend on wealth, rather than computational power, so there’s no incentive to have energy-hungry specialized hardware. That fixes both the energy need, as well as the hardware need. If you have something running on proof of stake, it wouldn’t even be 0.1 percent of the energy needed to run bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjE85M"&gt;If Ethereum can turn to proof of stake, theoretically, so can bitcoin, which would actually fix the environmental issues. But so far there has been no move inside the community to make such things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bT1x4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk has also talked up Dogecoin in the past. How does Dogecoin compare to bitcoin? Do you see it becoming as bad for the climate as bitcoin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLPFwe"&gt;The thing is, if something runs on proof of work, which is the case in Dogecoin, then it’s just as bad as bitcoin. The impact that Dogecoin has currently is a lot smaller than bitcoin, but that’s because the value of Dogecoin is a lot less and these things are directly related with each other. That’s kind of been the essence of my work over the past few years. There is a direct relationship between the value of these assets, how much money is being earned by the miners, and how much they’re spending on electricity. Very simply said, the more valuable an asset, the more money will be made by miners, the more they will spend on resources like hardware and energy. So, the fact that Dogecoin has a smaller impact than bitcoin is just because the value is a lot less, but if they were the same size, the impact would be equally bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xge3lH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just as bad as bitcoin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oPVeXG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve already started to see the value of bitcoin drop after Musk’s announcement. Are we starting to see emissions or energy use fall as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4S7wb"&gt;No. The price has gone down by maybe 15 percent. That does reduce the potential future emissions of the network. But it doesn’t reduce today’s emissions because, right now, bitcoin mining is extremely profitable. As it stands, the network’s impact will still continue to increase, unless the price goes down by a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBOJgE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much more would it take to see a decline in emissions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYzIIg"&gt;I wrote about that in a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349952553_Bitcoin_Boom_What_Rising_Prices_Mean_for_the_Network's_Energy_Consumption"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; recently. The current price is still around $50,000 per coin today, although I haven’t checked it for the past hour. Below $30,000, that’s where the current energy consumption would start to go down, so it has a long way to go. That’s kind of the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
