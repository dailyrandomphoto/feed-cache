    <title>Disney’s Star Wars hotel is just like Westworld: only for the wealthy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMftnanv7QExHesvfglzXqFP8lg=/216x0:1662x964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678764/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_1.53.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzpfjR"&gt;Disney has been teasing its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/16/15729120/star-wars-immersive-hotel-westworld-disney-d23-expo-2017"&gt;Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel&lt;/a&gt; for years now, promising an almost &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;-style immersive experience (complete &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418959/disney-real-lightsaber-reveal-video-star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel"&gt;with “real” lightsaber props&lt;/a&gt;) that will expand its Galaxy’s Edge theme park into a full-fledged two-day interactive &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; adventure. You’ll sleep in a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-themed room, eat and drink &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-inspired fare, and be surrounded by actors guiding you through your own &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; vacation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUF5IW"&gt;Today, the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fstar-wars-galactic-starcruiser%2Foverview%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609764%2Fdisney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a lot more information&lt;/a&gt; about the practical aspects of the Galactic Starcruiser experience, including a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fstar-wars-galactic-starcruiser%2Fplanning%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609764%2Fdisney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first look at pricing&lt;/a&gt; — and like the fictional &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt; theme park, it looks like Disney’s real world immersive Star Wars hotel will be limited to the extremely wealthy, with a two-night stay &lt;em&gt;starting&lt;/em&gt; at $4,809 for two adults. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GUrOwpecNSOiPtUSyUAznSBmxg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761342/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_10.07.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UawLiM"&gt;That price is just an estimate for an entry-level cabin, and things shake out differently depending on the number of guests in a group (a family of four with three adults and one child comes out to $5,999 for the two-night trip). The ticket includes two nights at the hotel, food and drink (except for “alcoholic and specialty beverages”), admission to Disney’s Hollywood Studios park for a day to visit the Galaxy’s Edge park, and parking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CexsAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See It. Feel It. Live It.  Get the details on Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, a 2-night adventure launching at Walt Disney World in Spring 2022.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Q4WaeIyX9L"&gt;https://t.co/Q4WaeIyX9L&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yqKLOzNHYE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yqKLOzNHYE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Walt Disney World (@WaltDisneyWorld) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WaltDisneyWorld/status/1422908040186114062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx5lWn"&gt;But you’re mostly paying for the immersive &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; experience, which Disney says will offer an in-universe style adventure, complete with roleplaying staff who’ll ask you for help on quests or factions that you’ll be able to join during your trip. Guests will even be allowed (and even encouraged) to dress the part in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; outfits (something that isn’t usually permitted at Disney parks for adult guests). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tpzl6J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s expensive, even by Disney resort standards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6F8Ol"&gt;There’s no way to look at Galactic Starcruiser as anything but an exorbitantly priced hotel, even by Disney standards. For comparison, a two-night stay during the same dates at the company’s Grand Floridian Resort — considered the most expensive and upscale option for staying at the park — along with two days’ worth of tickets at Disney parks for two adults comes to roughly $2,150 when booking directly through Disney, less than half the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fw8V0t"&gt;Obviously, that’s not a perfect comparison, given that Galactic Starcruiser is an all-inclusive stay that includes dining, but it’s clear that Disney is putting a &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt; premium on the immersive experiences that make Galactic Starcruiser unique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnrpyu"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fstar-wars-galactic-starcruiser%2Fexperience-highlights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609764%2Fdisney-star-wars-hotel-galactic-starcruiser-pricing-2022-interactive-immersive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sample itinerary&lt;/a&gt; from Disney includes activities like sabacc competitions, lightsaber training, and “unexpected” optional story moments that can pop up during a guest’s stay, which sound interesting enough. Half of one of the two days is dedicated to visiting Galaxy’s Edge and riding the two rides that have been open for months already, although guests will apparently be able to continue their storylines in the existing park from the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFT6VO"&gt;Maybe all that really is worth the incredibly high price of admission. Westworld sure looks popular on the TV show, too, and there are no lightsabers there. But right now, it looks like Disney has created what might be the ultimate &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; experience for fans, and priced it out of reach of all but the most wealthy of them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqOTAE"&gt;The highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bRFJnd"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle (8GB, ad-supported): $120 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$135&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lREHEL"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle (8GB, ad-supported): $170 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$190&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BR7xFN"&gt;Kindle Oasis Essentials Bundle (8GB, ad-supported): $290 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($&lt;s&gt;320&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZV2VTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is the usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for $110. If you buy either Kindle model, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids+ service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Although we’ve seen the Kindle Kids Edition drop to as low as $70 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $110, the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available for the Paperwhite, but you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon is currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $200&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4mZNi9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Sony’s next-gen PSVR was reportedly detailed at a developer summit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MK7-fj1uqTuCkjNn3iKzrBibqco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678703/jbareham_160930_1240_0017_2016.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s original PSVR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="egGgRr"&gt;More and more details for Sony’s planned next-generation PlayStation virtual reality headset appear to be popping up. According to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnAOWbzBEco"&gt;YouTube channel PSVR Without Parole&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/ps5-vr-headset-hdr-oled-aaa"&gt;further corroboration from &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Sony held a developer summit on Tuesday where it detailed new information about the controllers and game development strategy for the sequel to the PSVR, and seemed to confirm some features that have already been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iZtIX"&gt;Among the new details, the next-gen PSVR controllers (or NGVR controllers, based on what PSVR Without Parole claims is the codename for the device) can reportedly not only detect when you’re holding the controller and touching buttons but also how far away your fingers are. The feature sounds a bit like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer"&gt;the radar detection that Google’s built into its phones&lt;/a&gt; and smart home devices in the past with the Soli chip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NaQsCB"&gt;Sony also reportedly told developers it’s looking to pursue a hybrid model for future AAA releases on PlayStation. The goal being having optional VR support for all major releases, similar to what&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14369624/resident-evil-7-ps4-playstation-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18285578/no-mans-sky-vr-preview-sean-murray-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;received on the PS4 and PS5. As far as we know, a console is still required to use the PSVR, but if this plan is true, you could choose to play major AAA titles in VR or on your TV going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v3FZ4"&gt;Sony publicly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;announced the next-gen PSVR in February&lt;/a&gt; and detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;the features of its new controllers&lt;/a&gt; not long after. Taking into account the official information and what &lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;has reported as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429523/playstation-vr-ps5-rumors-eye-tracking-foviated-render-4k-screen-haptics"&gt;the possible specs for the device&lt;/a&gt;, here’s what we know about the next-gen PSVR so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hTK48h"&gt;The next-gen PSVR connects to PlayStation consoles through a single cable, no passthrough box necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ChiF4R"&gt;The headset features higher-resolution OLED displays that offer 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye (for a total 4K resolution) with an improved 110-degree field of view (10 degrees wider than the PSVR).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HvoTKq"&gt;Sony reportedly plans to use flexible scaling resolution in conjunction with foveated rendering enabled by eye tracking, to allow the device to only render what you’re actually looking at. The overall goal being to reduce the strain on the PSVR and PS5 and improve performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Itzae9"&gt;Sony will reportedly use inside-out tracking for the next-gen PSVR, and the company says the device’s controllers will have adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, touch-sensitive buttons, and reportedly the ability to sense the distance between your fingers and the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8FQ6z4"&gt;If all of these features bear out, it seems like Sony’s adopted a fair amount of the new VR standards popularized by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest and Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, and some of the more high-end features of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview"&gt;the Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172700/htc-vive-pro-eye-tracking-virtual-reality-headset-features-pricing-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;HTC Vive Pro&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536263/sony-playstation-vr-2-ps5-release-date-2022-samsung-oled"&gt;According to reporting from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Sony won’t actually launch the new PSVR until holiday 2022, but the company could finalize and announce more details later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3LjFE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colleges across the US and Canada are adopting virtual student IDs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ECONOMY-AUTO-MERCEDES" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b43bWA5DvZJ0m9gyOtxGeql0tIk=/0x76:4463x3051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678528/695753658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The University of Alabama will be the first school to exclusively issue mobile student IDs this fall.&lt;/em&gt; | ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vC0XZi"&gt;Apple Wallet has supported contactless student IDs &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2018%2F10%2Fapple-adds-support-for-contactless-student-id-cards-in-wallet%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, with three US universities supporting the feature at launch. The program has been &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F08%2Fapple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gradually expanding&lt;/a&gt; ever since. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fstudent-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-expand-to-canada-and-more-us-universities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F4%2F22609571%2Fapple-wallet-student-ids-university-expansion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; that its virtual IDs will finally arrive in Canada this fall. An unspecified number of additional US universities will adopt it for the first time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO6K5Z"&gt;The University of New Brunswick and Sheridan College will be the first two Canadian schools to use Apple Wallet IDs. The new US roster includes Auburn, Northern Arizona University, University of Maine, and New Mexico State University, in addition to “many more colleges across the country.” &lt;a href="https://news.ua.edu/2021/04/old-swipe-action-cards-deactivating-this-summer/"&gt;The University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, one of the program’s early adopters, will also be the first school to issue exclusively mobile student IDs (to students with eligible devices) this fall. (Those with Android phones can use the digital cards through Google Pay.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fl2DdY"&gt;Apple claims that “tens of thousands of college students” will have access to the feature during this upcoming school year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duke was one of the first universities to support virtual IDs in 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3KiTja"&gt;In theory, the virtual student ID should offer all the functionality of a regular student ID — holders can access restricted areas of campus or pay for amenities like food and laundry by placing their iPhone or Apple Watch near a physical reader. Transaction history isn’t shared with Apple or stored on Apple’s servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXmkxl"&gt;The new student ID format is part of Apple’s larger effort to expand Apple Wallet’s functionality. The app can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;store hotel room keys&lt;/a&gt; with the release of iOS 15 and will support driver’s licenses and state IDs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reconciliation could create a new kind of climate job</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bicameral Democrats Call For Civilian Climate Corps To Be Included In Reconciliation Process" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbAJ1wY-bjEqRVI8z9YKWVL-1jY=/0x34:6594x4430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678467/1329721258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks at a press conference urging the inclusion of the Civilian Climate Corps., a climate jobs program, in the budget reconciliation bill, outside of the U.S. Capitol on July 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. Ocasio-Cortez was joined by (L-R) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO), Joe Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and climate activists. | Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OZKWTb"&gt;If Democrats and progressives have their way, tens of thousands — or even millions — of Americans could soon find work planting urban trees, managing forests, and making homes more energy efficient and resilient to the ravages of climate change. They’d form a new “Civilian Climate Corps” that lawmakers and activists are hoping to fund through the budget reconciliation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ehubwh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The idea has picked up significant momentum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wYCzK"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/dems-agree-on-a-climate-corps-now-comes-the-hard-part/"&gt;more than a decade&lt;/a&gt;, different proposals have floated around for a new civilian mobilization focused on climate adaption. Recently, the idea has picked up significant momentum. The most ambitious proposal yet was introduced by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in April. Joe Biden proposed a more pared down Civilian Climate Corps as part of his American Jobs Plan in March, drawing on a range of previous proposals. Most recently, lawmakers have pushed for some form of the corps to be included in upcoming budget reconciliation negotiations, sending a &lt;a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/sites/kaptur.house.gov/files/Civilian%20Climate%20Corps%20Congressional%20Letter%20-%20Kaptur.pdf"&gt;joint letter&lt;/a&gt; to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgUaBx"&gt;The proposals differ in size and scope, but each would put people to work on federally funded projects that can minimize the toll climate change takes on the US. That might mean installing solar panels in Philadelphia, tending to sustainable urban farms in New York City, or building new career pathways for former coal communities in Appalachia. The Climate Corps would be overseen by a new body within the White House, and would also bolster the work of federal agencies like FEMA that already partner with other corps programs. And as the government establishes a new funding stream, the hope is that communities will find new projects and ways to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLe3Aj"&gt;There are already a range of nonprofit groups doing this work, and many are already looking to the Climate Corp proposals as a way to expand. “We’re ready to go,” says Julia Hillengas, executive director of one such program called PowerCorpsPHL. “There’s 130 plus corps across the country. There’s communities that are ripe and primed to start corps … they have all the pieces there, it’s just a matter of being able to get some of that seed funding to get things off the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yavEdA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re ready to go.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CIBxe2"&gt;The idea of a civilian environmental mobilization on New Deal-era concepts was launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to fight the Depression — particularly, the Civilian Conservation Corps launched in 1933, which provided job training and stipends to young men. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/08/01/fdr-cabinet-descendents-new-deal-biden-progressive-500659"&gt;Many in Biden’s staff&lt;/a&gt; have taken cues from Roosevelt as the current president looks to boost the economic recovery and prepare for future shocks from the climate crisis.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSER6A"&gt;Today’s corps programs generally serve two purposes: to accomplish some kind of public good, and to prepare its members for a particular vocation. In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members join “industry academies” focused on stormwater infrastructure, urban forestry, and solar energy. Since Hillengas co-founded the program in 2013, its members have planted more than 11,000 trees — an important &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573081/google-new-tool-hot-cities-trees-climate-change-temperature"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; for cooling down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;city neighborhoods that tend to be hotter&lt;/a&gt; than surrounding, greener areas. Many of their alumni move on to find related work afterward — members in the solar academy, for example, might find work installing or selling solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzIJrh"&gt;A similar program in New York City, called Green City Force, employs public housing residents who have built sustainable farms on public housing properties to provide organic, local produce to other residents. They also retrofit homes to make them more energy efficient, a vocation in which 65 percent of the program’s graduates have gone on to find employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members receive training on installing solar panels." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNx9Z9bAxEfxIM_scd1e2Vnd7pg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761167/solar_training.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Philadelphia, PowerCorpsPHL members receive training on installing solar panels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pTBMK4"&gt;“What we hear from a lot of corps is this need for institutional support that is equitable and just and robustly funded, for making sure that they have the monetary resources to go out into the community to recruit folks, to give them the training they need, and to put them to work,” says Becca Ellison, deputy policy director at the nonprofit Evergreen Action. Evergreen, environmental activist group Sunrise Movement, and Democratic lawmakers are also asking that 50 percent of the funding and jobs for the Climate Corps go to environmental justice communities. Those are places that have been disproportionately burdened with pollution from industry, and that typically have more low-income residents and residents of color.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjZOGX"&gt;In the long term, advocates hope that climate mitigation and resiliency initiatives could also create new, green career paths for people who otherwise might have found work in coal, oil, or gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4uLg9"&gt;“We can kind of create this new world, this new Appalachia that has vibrant communities with good paying jobs,” says Béla Williams, a sixteen-year-old community organizer from southwest Virginia who joined the Appalachian Conservation Corps this summer. “I think a lot of communities can benefit greatly from opportunities like the Civilian Climate Corps, especially in places that have been ravaged by the coal industry or other extractive industries leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WvQ5G3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can kind of create this new world, this new Appalachia.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HsCuvV"&gt;Advocates are optimistic that the package will include some kind of Civilian Climate Corps — but the size of the program is still up for debate. The Biden administration proposed $10 billion to be doled out over a decade, which might be able to fund up to 20,000 jobs a year by some estimates. Markey, Ocasio-Cortez, and Sunrise Movement have asked for far more — $132 billion to hire 1.5 million Climate Corps members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqj0RD"&gt;“[Markey and Ocasio-Cortez’s] proposal, we believe will signify the beginning of the decade of the green New Deal because it would give millions of good jobs to people,” says Ellen Sciales, communications director for Sunrise Movement. They say the more expensive proposal will also ensure that corps members make at least $15 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjdGVC"&gt;Without that funding, participants may be stuck making less than a living wage. Current members of AmeriCorps-funded programs get paid a minimum stipend of $16,000 a year, although organizations like PowerCorpsPHL often try to raise funds to pay their members more. The hope is that, with economic stimulus still on the White House agenda, the federal government will be willing to put in the necessary funds to make the programs economically sustainable and make climate mitigation part of a sustainable career path for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wKkaG"&gt;“That’s money in young people’s pockets that they’re using to support their families,” Hillengas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh516W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The author of this story was previously a member of Public Allies and Jumpstart, corps programs that are part of the AmeriCorps network. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buying an Oculus headset to help get your Facebook account back is a risky move</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0F-A37zq9kFNKi8U5Tnp3A6B8L4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69678427/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dDzlk"&gt;Some Facebook users stymied by the company’s seemingly impenetrable support channels have turned to an interesting — and expensive — loophole to get access to their locked accounts: buying an Oculus Quest headset, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023801277/your-facebook-account-was-hacked-getting-help-may-take-weeks-or-299"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn’t appear to be a reliable way to get access, as many reports online indicate that the solution didn’t work out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm6Qzh"&gt;The crux of the issue is that it’s often difficult to know if Facebook is receiving support requests when you submit them through its normal channels. From &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jY5bX0"&gt;Facebook tells users to report hacked accounts through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacked"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. The site instructs them to upload a copy of a driver’s license or passport to prove their identities. But the people NPR spoke with said they had trouble with every step of this automated process and wish Facebook would offer a way to reach a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXB0Bi"&gt;“I sent these forms in morning, noon and night, multiple times a day,” [Jessie] Marsala said. “Nobody got back to me, not once.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6VM9r2"&gt;Facebook says &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/155050237914643?helpref=faq_content"&gt;on its own support site&lt;/a&gt; that “we have fewer people available to review IDs because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic” and that reviews “may take longer than usual” as a result. And a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that “we also know that we need to keep improving in this area and plan to invest more in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZeyYz"&gt;The breakthrough, for some people, was a tip they found to buy a headset from Facebook-owned Oculus, which has its own customer support system, according to &lt;em&gt;NPR. NPR &lt;/em&gt;spoke with two people who successfully got access to their Facebook accounts after buying an Oculus. But we’ve found a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/on2ykq/buying_an_oculus_to_use_their_tech_support_to/h5psvmr/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/jc7ys6/oculus_support_can_not_help_you_with_facebook/g90tqaq/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/k66izc/facebook_account_issue/gejbaw8/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; indicating that Oculus support &lt;em&gt;hasn’t&lt;/em&gt; delivered a smoother support experience, so there’s no guarantee that it might work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb4prU"&gt;And even if you are thinking of buying an Oculus Quest 2 to try to get some support help, you can’t actually get one right now — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596076/facebook-oculus-quest-2-storage-upgrade-foam-face-mask-recall"&gt;Oculus has paused sales until August 24th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1oiU7a"&gt;The 2021 New York International Auto Show has been canceled as the delta variant of COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States. The show was supposed to run from August 20th to August 29th at the Jacob K. Javits Center in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BLTip"&gt;The show’s organizers announced the cancellation Wednesday “with great disappointment,” according to a statement, citing the spread of the delta variant and increased safety measures such as the new proof of vaccination requirements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607882/key-to-nyc-pass-covid-vaccine-proof-new-york-city"&gt;announced by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio this week&lt;/a&gt;. The decision came suddenly, as just last week organizers revealed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMartinez_AN/status/1422970236400193536"&gt;a poster for the event&lt;/a&gt; titled “The Future is Bright.” This year’s show was supposed to have a special focus on electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3jb9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All signs were positive... but today is a different story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3e1MX"&gt;“At the onset of planning for the August Show, we were increasingly excited at the prospect of hosting the event as the number of vaccinations in New York continued to climb and mask-wearing reduced the spread in the City,” the organizers said in the statement. “All signs were positive, and the Show was coming together stronger than ever, but today is a different story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjsNlg"&gt;The 2020 New York Auto Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173663/new-york-international-auto-show-2020-canceled-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;was one of the first to get delayed&lt;/a&gt; last year as the pandemic took hold, with organizers first pushing it to August before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267785/new-york-international-auto-show-nyais-2020-canceled-coronavirus"&gt;outright canceling it&lt;/a&gt;. (The Javits Center was used as a field hospital in the interim.) This year’s show was meant to be one of the first to return, following the &lt;a href="https://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/illinois-news/chicago-auto-show-2021-special-edition/article_17ca652d-baa0-58f9-9f99-3b39e6ac6e73.html"&gt;Chicago Auto Show last month&lt;/a&gt;. Others slated for later this year, such as the Los Angeles Auto Show in November, now hang in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXlZnB"&gt;“The Covid pandemic has challenged our City, the country and the entire world, but just like the automobile industry, we know that the New York Auto Show will rebound and be bigger and better than before,” the organizers wrote. “We firmly believe that will be the case when the Show returns to its regular spring schedule in April 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrhl1Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail 101: How to increase the time you have to unsend an email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qmHbArtknVt9jT9QN7gwgLnBi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677952/acastro_201210_1777_gmail_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6dPXS"&gt;If you’ve ever hit “Send” on a Gmail email and regretted it ten seconds later, you’ll know how handy — even necessary — a delayed send function can be. It could be the sudden realization that you accidentally hit “Reply all,” or a feeling that you may have sent it to the wrong contact, or that there is a misspelling somewhere in there — or, perhaps worst of all, the knowledge that you just sent off an angry missive that you probably shouldn’t have. In any of these cases, a few seconds to stop that email could keep your day from imploding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pt5Sc"&gt;(Gmail, of course, isn’t the only email app with this ability; other apps offer it as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwHx4K"&gt;Gmail offers a standard five-second window to allow you to change your mind and unsend the email, but if you feel that you need a little more time, you can arrange it. I find it valuable to allow myself a longer time to rethink an email; while I’ve only had to stop an email from going out a few times, those few times probably saved me from, at the very least, having to send out an apologetic follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW7NmW"&gt;You set it up using the web version of Gmail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Ofqpzt"&gt;Click on the “Settings” cogwheel in the upper right corner, and on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kbHzEe"&gt;Under the “General” tab, look for “Undo Send.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iFX0no"&gt;Choose how long you’d like Gmail to give you to change your mind: you can select five seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, or 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pj5hW0"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can have up to 30 seconds to change your mind." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1UTv0wlhqE0hJVVKpq195CPd9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759448/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.06.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can have up to 30 seconds to change your mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUMzf0"&gt;When you click on send, you’ll see an option in the lower left corner to “Undo” your email that will last as long as you’ve set it to; it will also be available in the mobile app. If you want, you can click on “Undo” and you’ll be brought back to your email draft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Undo” link at the bottom left will let you bring back your email, unsent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XmsEr7UInHhyS6qv4KbqXtF69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759459/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.11.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Undo” link at the bottom left will let you bring back your email, unsent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Code for America employees are unionizing </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XDj7CHqe0oenEBxNdOyeqJZBvpM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677844/CFA_169.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nV4pEz"&gt;Employees at Code for America (CFA) announced today they are unionizing with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 1010. Organizers say 62 people have signed authorization cards, meaning 77 percent of eligible employees have indicated their support for the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWpQEf"&gt;The national nonprofit builds tech products for government agencies, including helping &lt;a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/criminal-legal-system/clear-my-record/"&gt;county courthouses automatically clear peoples’ records&lt;/a&gt; once they are eligible and operating one of the &lt;a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/social-safety-net/getcalfresh/"&gt;biggest intake sites for California food stamp benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHt3Um"&gt;Employees say they are largely happy with the work — and are better paid than colleagues at other nonprofits. Still, they feel a union could give them more of a say in business decisions. “A union gives independent contributors a seat at the table,” says Ash Campo, a CFA employee and organizer. “Unionizing allows us to rethink the barrier between staff and management, so that regular staff can have a meaningful say in decisions that affect them and benefit the organization collectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV9eYQ"&gt;The announcement is part of a larger movement of white collar workers unionizing. In 2020, workers at Kickstarter formed&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt; one of the first unions made up of full-time white collar workers&lt;/a&gt; in the tech industry, also with OPEIU. Earlier this year, employees at Glitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307671/glitch-workers-sign-historic-collective-bargaining-agreement-cwa"&gt;signed one of tech’s first collective bargaining agreements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ryJcA"&gt;CFA’s organizing effort began almost a year ago. At first, some employees were skeptical, noting that the organization already gives employees input on policy decisions. But organizers felt this wasn’t enough. “Folks are generally happy with the way things are going and speak to the collaborative nature of management,” explains Ben Calegari, a software engineer and union organizer. “But I think an issue with that is it relies on having a relationship with managers to create change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQdQyS"&gt;Another union organizer who asked to remain anonymous agrees. “A union would give us collective power, where right now we have to rely on individual power to get things changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpPigP"&gt;Employees say they plan to advocate for better compensation and promotion policies and possibly a seat on the board. “We have an opportunity as nonprofit workers who make a little more and are better funded than others to prove that nobody is above dignified work, with the consent and input of workers,” says Calegari. “There are many people in worse conditions than ours who do not have the latitude to speak and move as freely as we do. So it’s our responsibility to use our freedom for the collective good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud6pWn"&gt;Ash Campo also says the union is a chance for CFA to fully realize its goals. “Code for America’s mission is to build technology by and for people, and for me unionizing is the actualization of that mission internally,” they explain. “We want to create policies that are built by people for people and unionizing is the only way to give us a seat at that table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TW5dcz"&gt;On Monday, the union asked Code for America management for voluntary recognition. Grace Reckers, a lead organizer with OPEIU, says she’s hopeful that will happen, but notes employees are prepared if it doesn’t. “I have full confidence they would win an election if we needed to go there,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCXfrc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6I4v4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s multiplayer mode is getting new content and a standalone release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O-Ujovrm_2w2a2sx-Bsj7aVfWNI=/170x0:2006x1224/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69677809/51355499484_95d501812b_o_scaled.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Legends’ new Rivals mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d73nRP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima’s&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer mode, &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt;, is getting some new free content and a standalone release, Sony and developer Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The standalone release will be available on September 3rd for $19.99 / €19.99 / £15.99 on both PS4 and PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG1TNl"&gt;That same day, a big new 2v2 mode called Rivals will be introduced to &lt;em&gt;Legends.&lt;/em&gt; Here’s how Darren Bridges, a senior game designer at Sucker Punch, &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/"&gt;describes it in a blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NK5z5y"&gt;In Rivals, two teams of two will compete to defeat waves of enemies. With each defeated foe, you’ll collect Magatama that you can use to harm the other team. For example, you can spend Magatama on Shades to block your opponents’ purchases, Curses (health drain, exploding bodies, etc), Hwacha fire, and more. Once you’ve spent enough Magatama, you’ll unlock Final Stand waves. Complete these before the opposing team to win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ahg62g"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCgjNK8etz8"&gt;check out this video for a preview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zTtpyT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mCgjNK8etz8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXthDP"&gt;Alongside Rivals, &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; will also get a Gear Mastery system to further kit out your gear. According to Bridges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P4Npfj"&gt;Players who’ve earned 110-level gear will now be able to bind it to a class and activate “Mastery Challenges.” This will allow a piece of gear’s Ki level to be upgraded to 120 and eventually unlock a second perk slot! As you activate Mastery Challenges, you can also unlock a new Ability and new Techniques for each class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mprtsS"&gt;Sucker Punch is also launching an update to &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; on August 20th, the same day as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;the release of &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that includes rebalancing Survival mode. And the developer is promising that &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; will receive a “new piece of content each week from September 10th through October 1st,” including a new map for Rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahz6OL"&gt;If you pick up the standalone &lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; and want to play the &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima &lt;/em&gt;single-player campaign, you can upgrade to &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"&gt;a new island to explore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587775/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-expansion-pet-cats-deer-monkeys-sony-sucker-punch"&gt;more animals to pet&lt;/a&gt;, for $40 / €50 /£44 on PS4 or $50 / €60 / £54 on PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ii0AOx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ghost of Tsushima is getting an enhanced director’s cut on the PS4 and PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island"},{"title":"Ghost of Tsushima’s dark new expansion has fuzzy cats to pet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587775/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-expansion-pet-cats-deer-monkeys-sony-sucker-punch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
