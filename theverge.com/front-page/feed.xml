  &lt;p id="HRCzbE"&gt;Mother’s Day is Sunday, May 9th. You knew that though. That’s why you already got Mom a gift. Nice going... Wait, you haven’t done that yet? Today is likely the cut-off date for guaranteeing that orders placed online will get where they need to be by Sunday (you may have luck tomorrow, but I wouldn’t push it, personally). So, without further delay, let’s load you up with a few last-minute ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPaTg3"&gt;Firstly, our team has already compiled a big, varied list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;Mother’s Day gift ideas right here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s refreshed to reflect the strange year that 2020 was and that 2021 is proving to be. There are fun gifts in there, as well as practical ones. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EOweJI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10443858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GpZDC0"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is $35 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $95. We’ve seen a slightly lower price on this before, but it’s still a good value if you’re looking for an e-reader that’s waterproof and has a sharp, easy-to-read display. This model is ad-supported, so its lockscreen will display an ad. You can opt out of ads, but it’ll cost you $20, either by purchasing the ad-free version of the Paperwhite, or by paying to disable ads from within the user interface post-purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo1TFk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="AKNl6G"&gt;Amazon conveniently lists out all of its deals on its own tech devices &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=11851273011&amp;amp;ref_=sv_devicesubnav_8&amp;amp;nocache=1620306457330"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/ref=gbps_tit_m-2_27e8_634b04f1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=bf99b579-14ba-44d5-87dd-a98574bc27e8&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=11851273011&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=EPMBBV40RBT0HHHCFKH4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV 4K streaming devices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X/ref=gbps_tit_m-2_27e8_c57d83e0?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=bf99b579-14ba-44d5-87dd-a98574bc27e8&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=11851273011&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=EPMBBV40RBT0HHHCFKH4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/326ed8bd/ref=gbps_tit_m-2_27e8_326ed8bd?showVariations=true&amp;amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=bf99b579-14ba-44d5-87dd-a98574bc27e8&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=11851273011&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=EPMBBV40RBT0HHHCFKH4"&gt;Echo Show smart displays&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="XHizi7"&gt;Logitech’s excellent G502 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse is almost $50 off at a few retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739789224930594992#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLogitech-G502-Lightspeed-Wireless-Optical-Gaming-Mouse-with-RGB-Lighting-%2F203188924516%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F6%2F22422645%2Fmothers-day-tech-gifts-deals-ideas-amazon-kindle-apple-ipad-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy via eBay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $150, it’s down to $104. Check this model out if you’re looking for a wireless model that has several customizable buttons (including one of the best scroll wheels out there), adjustable weight, and a comfortable fit. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s the best wireless gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; for all of those reasons, so take advantage of the deal while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MWForJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Since the newer iPad Pro with the M1 chip went up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22409463/apple-m1-imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-preorders-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for preorder&lt;/a&gt;, the price for this model, with the A12Z Bionic processor, has fallen sharply. $800 is the best price on record for this model. This Amazon page says $900, but you should see underneath it a message that says “Save $100 at checkout,” and the price will fall once you place the order.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The art of making simple but tough rhythm games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3QIFgE4o3RFy5suJarM8UhNyRM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245754/ss_7dc2c278e2c6c2346c8f1a9a0ec30ddfc3d502ca.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: D-Cell Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Unbeatable and Rhythm Doctor make the genre more accessible — and challenging&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="seA3kE"&gt;From the trailer’s opening, with its striking, pastel-colored anime visuals, loud rock guitar riffs, and energetic vocals, &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dcellgames/unbeatable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;looks and sounds &lt;em&gt;incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyn7DE"&gt;Wrapped in turn-of-the-millennium influences in both its anime and rock aesthetic, it looks like a game from the Dreamcast era, with its tagline calling it “a game where music is illegal and you do crimes” recalling the youthful rebellious spirit of &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt;. But as the trailer for its successful Kickstarter shows, it’s also part of a new wave of indie rhythm games, alongside early access title &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/774181/Rhythm_Doctor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where accessibility is at the forefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLu0Pj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; may have aesthetics inspired by Japanese rhythm games, where in the arcades they are known either for peripherals or for demanding intimidating dextrous feats, but its inputs are much simpler. As pink-haired protagonist Beat, players use just two buttons to hit oncoming enemies and objects much like notes approaching on top and bottom lanes from either the left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwbgBN"&gt;The format, which had one fan dubbing it “street-style Taiko,” went through some iteration since the project first materialized with a public demo at 2019’s MAGFest, as the developer D-Cell Games explained to me over Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIkyrB"&gt;“That version was four buttons, and what we actually found was, ironically, that made the game too easy for the people who were really into rhythm games but too hard for anyone who was coming in new,” explains RJ Lake, &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s writer and music supervisor. “Cutting it to two buttons made it way more approachable if you have no idea what a rhythm game is or how rhythm games are supposed to play. But then because there’s only two buttons to pay attention to, we can throw a lot more at the player without them feeling overwhelmed, which means our songs can be mapped in a much more complex way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="oRajVw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-xFczhoZb8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb8Uvt"&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s songs are played to note charts typical of the genre, the team actually took their cue from action games, which can be seen with how the buttons correspond to the visuals as Beat attacks, dodges, or combos different notes. “We wanted to draft a rhythm system that felt like playing an action combat game akin to a PlatinumGames title,” says Jeffrey Chiao, the game’s producer and level designer. “I think what was the initial accepted draft that we built with was something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;One Finger Death Punch&lt;/em&gt;, which is not actually a rhythm game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWpTFG"&gt;That approach has, incidentally, thrown some players for a loop. Instead of just watching oncoming notes to hit on cue, you might also be avoiding others by hitting the opposite button, while more devious are blue notes that need a 1-2 combo follow-up. While the team is aware of the feedback and aims to balance it, those elements are still very much intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8tbQY"&gt;“The blue note design is a pretty good example of trying to hit in that action, where the down and up is kind of like in &lt;em&gt;Devil May Cry&lt;/em&gt; when you do a launcher and then juggle the enemy that’s thrown up in the air,” adds Chiao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xOViY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For me, rhythm games are also much more of a casual thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHEIwH"&gt;The team is only too aware of the ridiculously high level of play certain rhythm aficionados can reach, but ultimately accessibility has been an important priority. “I loved &lt;em&gt;Elite Beat Agents&lt;/em&gt; and crushed that game in one sitting when it came out,” says Lake. “But for me, rhythm games are also much more of a casual thing. When I’m working on the project, a thing I try to focus on is making sure that people who aren’t going to sit down and endlessly play the same song to full-combo perfection, but want to come in and just enjoy music in an interactive way, will still be invested in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lre7OP"&gt;Some accessibility options are already apparent in the demo, such as reducing the visual clutter with various toggles (the aim is for more granular customization for the final product) and even an option to lose the game’s intentionally fuzzy filter, which gives it the vibe of a long-lost bootleg VHS recording of a cult anime. “There’s nothing harder in the world at this point, we’ve realized, than trying to make a game that everyone will like,” says Lake. “But at the very least, we’d like to settle for a game that everyone can play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYks7udaAa0sK4ujM7jmSm5AH3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489115/ss_ec7ff92bacd37cf1242079931cf0ad7a1a1aadc2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcoLu"&gt;Preceding &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable,&lt;/em&gt; however, is &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;, which is arguably even more accessible, as it’s all limited to just one button. This mimics your role as a remote medical intern tasked with hitting a defibrillator to treat patients with strange ailments. But anyone who’s played it will also know that the simple premise of smacking the space bar at the seventh beat of a tune is more devilishly difficult than it lets on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNPp4r"&gt;Development has been far from straightforward. The project has been going on for almost a decade; it first started as a college summer project that resulted in a Flash demo. The one-button design was in part due to developer Hafiz Azman’s dislike of the multi-button dexterity demanded by most rhythm games. “After the first few levels were released as a Flash demo, it became a kind of challenge to myself to see how far I could go without ever introducing a second button,” he tells me over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30Viow"&gt;Part of why &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt; has taken so long to make is also the challenge of keeping within those constraints, where in some cases a boss level might have taken hundreds of hours to iterate and perfect. “There’s tons of concepts and even full levels that we threw away, a lot of times it’s because the level isn’t delightful or surprising enough,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PHQuc0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It gets difficult to squeeze out the surprise from a simple mechanic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nsZoiY"&gt;“It gets difficult to squeeze out the surprise from a simple mechanic, but I think that struggle is also necessary. I read somewhere that the writing team behind &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; held to that principle of writing without looking ahead too much — they’d write themselves into a corner that they had no idea how to get their characters out of, and then sit in the writing room and struggle until they figured out something. The end result would be surprising to them, and as a result, surprising to the viewers too. I guess we ended up following that philosophy by sticking so adamantly to our constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1R25i"&gt;Another reason for sticking to the one-button mechanic was because &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt; was designed to be “blind-friendly,” which in theory meant that visuals mattered less. Of course, part of the game’s delight and deviousness is down to its deliberately distortive and distracting visuals designed to throw players off. Indeed, you might have an easier time by shutting your eyes and just focusing on listening to the beat in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jc0rkw"&gt;“We actually needed to put extra effort in the visuals because, if the visuals are technically redundant, that means we have a lot more flexibility to do anything we want with it, so our ceiling of what to achieve is higher if we want to use everything we could potentially do,” explains Azman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVn5y7"&gt;It’s the simplicity of the design that then allows for more complex layers to be built on top of it, such as the night modes that provide an alternative version of a song with a more difficult twist. “For example, the first level in the game is about counting to seven only with no other mechanics. So for the night shift version, I settled on using dubstep because that genre tends to have bass sounds that change rhythms quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="9jt84B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BaF2YFhLaok?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OEzrFh"&gt;Arguably, being able to prove these concepts in early stages, whether it’s a demo or early access, has been key to the successful reception these games have so far gotten. Meanwhile, D-Cell Games has already gone above and beyond by not only dropping an “arcade mix” &lt;a href="https://dcellgames.itch.io/unbeatable-arcade-mix"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; at the start of &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s Kickstarter campaign, but also following it up with a “white label” demo that tells a side story showcasing the game’s narrative adventure elements (although at time of writing, this hasn’t yet been made available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kLpL4"&gt;Granted, &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; actually achieved its $55,000 funding goal before the demo had even gone live, but its success is a stark contrast to the crowdfunding misfortunes of rhythm game &lt;em&gt;Project Rap Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; a few years ago. Even a project with the combined talents of legendary rhythm studios NanaOn-Sha (&lt;em&gt;PaRappa the Rapper&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vib-Ribbon&lt;/em&gt;) and iNiS (&lt;em&gt;Gitaroo Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Elite Beat Agents&lt;/em&gt;) couldn’t get funded. While that could be down to the much higher funding goal (its final pledges actually amounted to slightly more than what &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; currently has), it also suffered from failing to present actual gameplay footage that could communicate what kind of rhythm game it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cz05z"&gt;“Messaging is so, so important when you launch your Kickstarter,” says Lake. “If you do not have any external aesthetic sense, and you’re not hiring people or working with people who have the ability to make a project really shine in someone else’s eyes, you’re not going to have people want to even look at it to begin with. It’s so important to present the project well and make sure people aren’t confused or have any of those lingering questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijuvHW"&gt;Azman mentions that early in development, he was actually approached by indie publisher Humble based on &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;’s Flash demo, although nothing came of it. “They went silent for weeks, but got back to us saying they couldn’t get anyone else in the team to see how a single-button mechanic where you just press space on the seventh beat could ever support a full game,” he says. “It was clear people much more experienced than us thought it wasn’t wise to stick to a constraint, but we did it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoFt4h"&gt;Rhythm has always been integral in games, whether showing up as a mini-game or as an underlying mechanic to something as hardcore and mainstream as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animturnbull/status/1116028893125677057?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Another recent trend has been to explicitly mash rhythm up with other genres as a hybrid, such as dungeon-crawling roguelike &lt;em&gt;Crypt of the NecroDancer&lt;/em&gt; or first-person shooter &lt;em&gt;BPM: Bullets Per Minute&lt;/em&gt;, although Azman is less interested by these: “It’s a personal preference, but adding rhythm to an existing genre feels like it inhibits the freedom that was there before, rather than adding something exciting to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MOS0np"&gt;But with both &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;, it’s an exciting time for the genre to go back to basics, finding the joy of rhythm in its pure, distilled form. As Lake puts it, “We want to bring more types of people to get the basic joy of pressing buttons in response to a beat. There’s something just gut-level brain-tingling about doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4’s latest teaser is a glimpse of Eleven’s dark past</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stranger Things 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZrEWuS4ebQ_JfXfUH9N_XMV0c4=/302x0:2090x1192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245554/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.08.12_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGwIZU"&gt;It’s been a long time since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891537/stranger-things-netflix-renewed-season-four-hawkins-duffer-brothers-deal-tv"&gt;Netflix first announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;— the upcoming fourth season of the streamer’s hugely popular series — but there’s finally a new trailer teasing the next adventures of the Hawkins gang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlEkwc"&gt;The new teaser appears to be a flashback, showing the sinister Dr. Martin Brenner addressing a group of children at the same facility that Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) originated from. Presumably, the new season will continue to explore Eleven’s origins, as well as potentially introduce other supernatural children (something the show has explored before back in season 2.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FI1yE1"&gt;The new trailer is technically the second for the upcoming fourth season, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;following a teaser released back in February 2020&lt;/a&gt; that promised the return of the — spoilers for season 3 — presumably dead (in an extradimensional portal explosion) Chief Jim Hopper, played by David Harbour. Based on the captions of the two videos (001/004 and 002/004, respectively), it seems that fans should expect two more teasers on the way at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHOZg9"&gt;The lengthy amount of time between that last teaser and today’s new trailer is because Netflix was only able to get in two weeks of filming at the beginning of 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; work on the series only resumed last September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drcJLW"&gt;Netflix has yet to announce a release date for the fourth season, but presumably, with the marketing campaign ramping up again, it won’t be too far off before &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; debuts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s HomePod and HomePod mini can now integrate with music streaming service Deezer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7Fh8ctVESXqYoMA1hXQE_RR3m4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245527/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKd53X"&gt;Owners of Apple’s HomePod and HomePod mini can now connect their smart speakers directly to Deezer and make the music streaming service their default player. That means they can take advantage of the HomePod’s Siri voice controls to navigate their tunes and playlists on Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJnhri"&gt;To connect the services, you’ll first need to be a paying Deezer subscriber. If you are, head to the Deezer app on your iOS device (make sure you’re on iOS 14.3 or later), hit the settings cog in the top right, then scroll down and hit “Connect with HomePod.” You can then play music from Deezer on your Apple speakers by saying “Hey Siri, play [insert cool and relevant band of choice] on Deezer&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5PDD0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s smart speakers now work directly with Deezer, but still no Spotify&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5oidUz"&gt;Alternatively,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you can make Deezer your default player from Apple’s Home app and avoid having to specify which streaming service to use. We weren’t able to test this ourselves, but it’s likely the same process as for other third-party streaming services. So go to Home Settings by hitting the house icon in the top left of Apple’s Home app, tap on your face under the “People” section,” then go to “Default Service” and choose Deezer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzwbri"&gt;Phew. Isn’t it fantastic when these services &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AShI0p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="c3dlfx"&gt;Of course, the struggle to offer these sorts of basic, third-party integrations is exactly what’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;hurt&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s smart speakers, likely contributing to the company’s decision to discontinue the original HomePod in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;March this year&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the reasonably-priced and good-sounding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt; still soldiers on. In addition to Deezer, these devices can now directly integrate with other streaming services including Apple Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and Pandora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuR9VH"&gt;What’s missing from this list, of course, is Spotify. Although Apple says it’s enabled integration with the music streaming giant, as far as we know Spotify hasn’t switched things on at its end. If you’re searching for an explanation, look no further than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;huge lawsuit Spotify is currently pursuing against Apple&lt;/a&gt;. As an alternative, you can use Spotify to play music on HomePod speakers, but you’ll need to connect via AirPlay, which is frustratingly slow and lacks voice controls — one of the big draws of using a smart speaker at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82dyym"&gt;But hey, that’s what you, the unlucky consumer, get for being stuck between two warring corporations. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to hide apps from your iPhone’s home screen using iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7MsKC4IL9WCnMxho9Z8yeE3GYPU=/0x0:3441x2294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245433/iphone-games-004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9tHJL"&gt;If you get annoyed with the number of apps that crowd your iPhone’s home screen, you probably welcomed a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21291695/apple-ios-14-updates-home-screen-redesign-features-release-date-wwdc-2020"&gt;came with iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;: the App Library, which gathers all of your apps into various categories and displays them on a separate page to the right of your home pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9dNBXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14’s App Library to organize your apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pt9K1X"&gt;The App Library doesn’t only add some automatic organization to your iPhone’s home pages, but allows you to clean up your home screen by hiding as many apps as you want. You can keep your favorites front and center, and get the more utilitarian or less-used apps out of the way. (In fact, one way to keep a clean screen is to have all your newly-installed apps appear in your App Library only — we offer directions on how to do that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQvLxm"&gt;If you want to organize your current apps by hiding some of them, there are several ways to do it. You can remove individual apps from the home screen, you can hide an entire screen of apps, or you can organize several apps by putting them into a folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwz9rr"&gt;Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vjeqk2"&gt;Hide a single app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoswT8gw8DQFQzcLTVfk_jITo7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494263/IMG_6FDA0D8317B4_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Remove from Home Screen”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkFpNCzdZ1YD4yxdcVDXS2ZDXC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494261/IMG_0106.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Remove from Home Screen”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3fNxy"&gt;To hide individual apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCkcpw"&gt;Press on your selected app until a menu appears. The menu will include a number of options, depending on the app’s features (for example, if I press on an app for Microsoft Teams, the menu will let me make a new call or start a chat). But you will always get an option (in red) to remove the app. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dYLK3y"&gt;You will now have the choice of deleting the app from the phone or removing it from the home screen. Select the latter. You’ll still find the app in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1tHXdP"&gt;If the app is not already in the App Library, then after you tap “Remove App,” you will instead be given the choice of either deleting the app or moving it to the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hNL7OI"&gt;Hide a page of apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYpm-d8akSfLGxkJjGFbz-bQHe4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494282/IMG_70E40F5ECAB6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Uncheck the screen that you want to hide" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pldHVJRMw7Ti3jEUwGSO5odrScc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494275/IMG_8FD48CFB7F74_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncheck the screen that you want to hide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rALNn7"&gt;You can also hide an entire page of apps — and get rid of that page — at one blow if you want. And since it’s really easy to also restore that same page, it’s a great way to hide groups of apps that you only use occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v4tT06"&gt;Tap and hold on an empty part of your screen until the apps begin to jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XKAP6x"&gt;Tap on the dots at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPXkm"&gt;You’ll now be able to see small versions of all your screens (except the App Library and Today View). Beneath each visible screen is a checkmark; uncheck any screen you want to hide and tap “Done” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wXDkoH"&gt;To “unhide” any of the screens, follow these same directions and replace the checkmark of the screen that you want to see again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P0gvzg"&gt;Use folders to organize apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIpIBK9-M5LOQWtd7jjCpYtCNps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494310/IMG_F1C450C97344_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4GXqYO_GOuozrOkz0QtaYgPcgwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494266/IMG_0D571D5779F9_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the folder to access the apps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SK6n99"&gt;You can use folders on the home screen to gather similar apps together and save space. You won’t be completely hiding the apps — they’ll be there. But they’ll be consolidated in a single space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPxg35"&gt;It’s very simple to create a folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="626Ixd"&gt;Long-press on an app in the home screen until the icons jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dMfIlH"&gt;Move the app onto one of the other apps you want to group it with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ufgkAJ"&gt;You’ll now have a gray icon that contains the icons for the apps in the folder. Tap on the icon to open the folder and access the apps in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f6j7NI"&gt;iOS will assign a name to the folder depending on what apps you’ve put in it. To change the name, long-press on the folder, and select “Rename” from the pop-up menu. Then type in the new name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pq0N0qhP4_upKkheuMYVu92wt1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494270/IMG_0C514D9DDEC0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the folder to rename or remove it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can rename it anything you like" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1skcDiJqHcDYYlA5oUP-CjpD8O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494272/IMG_B98F55477CAA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can rename it anything you like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Fcht3h"&gt;To remove an app from a folder, simply open the folder, long-press the app until it jiggles, and move it out of the folder and to another space on your home screen. If you remove all the apps from a folder, the folder will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="el18TB"&gt;If you want to get rid of a folder, you can also long-press on it and select “Remove Folder.” Any apps that were in the folder can then be found in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UT4l6g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxDiB3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egtIJp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNNBa0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bwkyff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus Zenfone 8 Flip leak pairs flipping cameras with Snapdragon 888</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCi4BG0vVvAlij763OVfUNK4bEs=/0x0:1296x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245135/asus_zenfone_8_flip_image_feat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8 Flip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IDv02h"&gt;Asus’s successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21400709/asus-zenfone-7-flipping-triple-camera-zoom-ultrawide-battery-90hz-oled-display"&gt;last year’s Zenfone 7&lt;/a&gt; has leaked online, pointing to a return for the phones’ flipping camera array on May 12th. Specs and images of two upcoming devices — the Zenfone 8 and Zenfone 8 Flip — have been &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on information provided by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354"&gt;leaker Ishan Agarwal&lt;/a&gt;. As its name suggests, the 8 Flip has three cameras built into a mechanical flipping mechanism that rotates them over the top edge of the display to take selfies, while the 8 has two rear cameras in a more standard rectangular camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV8F8G"&gt;From the leaks, the Zenfone 8 Flip appears to be a comparatively minor spec bump compared to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408307/asus-zenfone-7-pro-review"&gt;Zenfone 7 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got a Snapdragon 888 processor rather than a Snapdragon 865 Plus, but the new model has the same massive 5,000mAH battery, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. The 1080p OLED display is still notchless thanks to the flipping cameras, still 6.67 inches in size, and still 90Hz, according to the leak. It also reportedly weighs the same at 230 grams, which could mean another heavy device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Ffrdn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Full Specs &amp;amp; Renders of the ASUS Zenfone 8 &amp;amp; Zenfone 8 Flip, launching on May 12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zenfone 8 is a compact smartphone with 5.92" screen size while th 8 Flip has a 6.67" AMOLED Display.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both feature Snapdragon 888 &amp;amp; 64MP Main Camera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please link &amp;amp; credit: &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk"&gt;https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/MCc2p5ISaK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MCc2p5ISaK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ishan Agarwal (@ishanagarwal24) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rn2rP"&gt;The cameras also appear similar, with one key difference. While last year’s Zenfone 7 Pro had a 64 megapixel main camera paired with a 8 megapixel telephoto and 12 megapixel ultrawide, the new 8 Flip will apparently swap out the ultrawide for a 12 megapixel macro. We generally find ultrawide cameras much more useful than macro cameras on phones, making this an unfortunate change if accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pocxci1AUQaLgnCeFnRDlvumiys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495517/asus_zenfone_8_render_01_1068x1066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aOE2WZ"&gt;Meanwhile, the standard Zenfone 8 is a much more traditional device, according to the leak. It’ll apparently have a smaller 5.92-inch 1080p display, but internally there’s the same Snapdragon 888 processor, and 8GB of RAM, albeit with a smaller 4,000 mAh battery and 128GB of internal storage. It’ll also reportedly come with one less rear-facing camera since it lacks the telephoto of the 8 Flip. That said, it should have the same number of cameras overall thanks to its separate hole-punch selfie camera on the front. It’s also fitted with an increasingly rare headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzXUYu"&gt;No details were given on the phones’ pricing or release dates, but with a launch event reportedly coming next week, we won’t have long to wait for official information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the bad iPhone web app experience keeps coming up in Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OIbeBrT5UyAXI-cns6znc8cu6Eo=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245096/xcloudiphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Safari just doesn’t support key features — and Safari’s the only option&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8gwpz8"&gt;Something keeps coming up at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial as a potential alternative for getting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the iPhone: web apps. It’s an intriguing idea, as web apps are able to do surprisingly complex things: just look at a Chromebook or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;game streaming services on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But potential is far from reality, because the ability for web apps to look, feel, and perform as well as native apps on iOS is severely limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Merj"&gt;These web apps aren’t the preferred way for consumers or developers to use or create apps on the iPhone, either. But Apple has forced companies like Microsoft and Nvidia to use web apps, instead of native ones available in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yylJtA"&gt;Though the term itself hasn’t really come up explicitly, what’s being discussed are Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs. If you’re unfamiliar, think of them as slightly more advanced web apps that you can “install” directly from your web browser onto your home screen. Google has been pushing the idea (though support for PWAs on its own platforms is a little mixed), and some companies like Microsoft and Twitter have wholeheartedly embraced PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUwtju"&gt;Not Apple, though. There are a variety of reasons for that — ranging from genuine concern about giving web pages too much access to device hardware to the simple fact that even Apple can’t do everything. There’s also the suspicion that Apple is deliberately dragging its feet on support for features that make PWAs better as a way to drive developers to its App Store instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRg3ygALY-Q38sy-_H2NB_ZyQDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10437351/fortniteiphonex.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt; running on an iPhone before its removal.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J19AAK"&gt;But the App Store has restrictions that aren’t tenable for some developers. That’s the whole crux of this trial for Epic, after all. On the stand, a Microsoft executive detailed the company’s struggles to get its xCloud game streaming service onto iOS. Lori Wright, VP of Xbox business development at Microsoft, revealed the company spent around four months talking to Apple to try and get xCloud launched as a native app. Apple seemed, initially, open to the idea of letting Microsoft use the same model as Netflix or Audible. But Apple changed its mind and forced Microsoft, Nvidia, and others to list cloud games as separate apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCMbLT"&gt;Submitting Xbox games one-by-one was simply a nonstarter for Microsoft, so it resorted to making a web app. In addition to the technical hurdles a web app involves, it also introduces a discoverability issue. Users simply aren’t used to installing apps from the web on their iPhones. Apple has effectively trained everybody that if they want an app, they go to the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0etUj"&gt;Wright essentially admitted that the only reason Microsoft is releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) as a web app is because Apple’s terms on the App Store are too onerous. “People don’t play games through the browser on iPhone,” said Wright, but “it was our only outcome in order to reach mobile users on iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXkjIF"&gt;Even the judge in the case seemed confused by Apple’s rule, which says that services that stream movies can offer them all in a single app, but services that stream games have to separate each game for individual listing and review. “I can use Netflix with a native app and I can see lots of different movies or TV shows or whatever. Is it that you didn’t want to use a subscription model?” Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Uu-KLuKdNnlK8sa1T0vd91UANM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334298/microsoft_xcloud_e3_2019_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has forced Microsoft and others to head to the web for gaming streaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2sTjH"&gt;But back to those technical hurdles: they’re high, numerous, and can be blamed both on the nature of web apps and Apple’s own decisions. Safari on the iPhone only &lt;em&gt;recently&lt;/em&gt; became capable of supporting a service like Xbox Cloud Gaming via specific controller support. Until then, that sort of thing was on the list of features Apple was reticent to include in Safari. There are legitimate reasons to block things like Bluetooth access from web apps, including fingerprinting for tracking, but it was getting harder to justify and Apple needed some kind of escape valve as pressure mounted to support cloud gaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYerIx"&gt;Google software engineer Alex Russell recently &lt;a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/"&gt;published a very comprehensive list of all the features that Safari on iOS doesn’t support yet&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s a long list. For PWAs to truly be a viable alternative to App Store apps, there are at least a few of these features that need to be enabled. The inability to send push notifications via a web app, for example, is particularly galling as it’s already possible on Safari on macOS. An app that can’t send notifications is simply not competitive with an app that can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="gEm2RS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Grant is touching on some more of the benefits to native versus web apps; push notifications and ARKit both come up. The former is another example of Apple letting native apps reduce friction points — Epic needs to convince the judge these smaller features are meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390045337000284161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9L1lz"&gt;As Russell notes, his “interests and biases are plain” as a Google engineer. But it doesn’t change the fact that there are many things that a PWA cannot do on the iPhone that a developer like Epic would need to support &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a web app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EQVkX"&gt;“Native [iPhone] apps would have access to a far wider range of APIs than web apps,” explained Andrew Grant, engineering fellow at Epic Games, during the trial. “Access to things like push notifications, to Siri, to health data, and augmented reality features” are also limited to native apps, said Grant. Web apps also have to be far smaller than native apps, and are capped at about 50MB in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl61s4"&gt;Plus, from a simple performance perspective, web apps have more overhead than native apps — and lack access to Apple APIs that can speed up games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0ncWG"&gt;In fact, this was a sticking point for a lot of the questioning of an Nvidia employee. Nvidia, like Microsoft, has been trying to get its GeForce Now cloud gaming service into the App Store, but has faced the same restrictions that Microsoft is struggling with. Nvidia director of product management Aashish Patel spent a lot of time answering questions around latency in a browser and the benefits of using native apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZgVIj"&gt;“There are less controls over the streaming, so you could argue in some ways it’s worse,” than a native app, said Patel. Developers are also locked into using the video codecs provided in Safari on iOS, whereas they could use alternatives that might be better at handling latency inside a native iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5THJwULmAlKJTxhxmhw3tU-Irjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19206401/akrales_190914_3666_0259.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All iOS browsers run the same WebKit engine underneath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KtWlda"&gt;All of this is compounded by yet another Apple policy: no third-party browser engines. You can install apps like Chrome, Firefox, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and others on the iPhone — but fundamentally they’re all just skins on top of Apple’s WebKit engine. That means that Apple’s decisions on what web features to support on Safari are final. If Apple were to find a way to be comfortable letting competing web browsers run their own browser engines, a lot of this tension would dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEbgNQ"&gt;As it relates to &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of this PWA discussion isn’t germane to the fundamental arguments in the case. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a PWA would necessarily be a streaming app instead of a native game, and that introduces an entirely different set of compromises. Which is why it’s so fascinating to see Apple’s lawyers float web apps as a potential solution — because web apps on the iPhone are famously more limited than they are on other platforms, including even Apple’s macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SC0v1r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The human-readable versus machine-readable code bit is back now — Grant is talking about how web apps don’t go through the same kind of compilation process that increases processing efficiency, yet another reason they’re not as good as native apps.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390047726549749760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HcaeCs"&gt;Even if every single browser feature was available on mobile Safari or even if Apple allowed alternative browser engines on the iPhone, a web app will never match the performance of a native app. At the end of the day, though, all the discussion of web apps in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case highlights the limitations of Apple’s App Store policies, not of PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is finally ditching its Windows 95-era icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/duBv9J2vh3DTpDWsqSkCF6MaQ2Y=/170x0:1430x840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245027/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5R89km"&gt;Microsoft is finally preparing to refresh its Windows 95-era icons. The software giant has been slowly improving the icons it uses in Windows 10, as part of a “sweeping visual rejuvenation” planned for later this year. We saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348639/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-new-icons-system-update"&gt;number of new system icons back in March&lt;/a&gt;, with new File Explorer, folder, Recycle Bin, disk drive icons, and more. Microsoft is now planning to refresh the Windows 95-era icons you still sometimes come across in Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLgwiy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2021/05/06/windows-10-sun-valley-update-also-refreshes-icons-in-shell32/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Latest &lt;/em&gt;has spotted&lt;/a&gt; new icons for the hibernation mode, networking, memory, floppy drives, and much more as part of the shell32.dll file in preview versions of Windows 10. This DLL is a key part of the Windows Shell, which surfaces icons in a variety of dialog boxes throughout the operating system. It’s also a big reason why Windows icons have been so inconsistent throughout the years. Microsoft has often modernized other parts of the OS only for an older app to throw you into a dialog box with Windows 95-era icons from shell32.dll.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFM30IRP6ii4m4qHakyhlVYZyzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495516/Windows_Shell32_icons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Windows Latest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New vs. old Windows 95-era icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PoqXjv"&gt;Hopefully this also means Windows will never ask you for a floppy disk drive when you dig into Device Manager to update a driver. That era of Windows, along with these old icons, has been well and truly over for more than a decade now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jXDOB"&gt;All of this work to improve the consistency of Windows is part of Microsoft’s design overhaul to Windows 10, codenamed Sun Valley. The visual changes are expected to appear in the Windows 10 21H2 update that should arrive in October. Microsoft has not officially detailed its Sun Valley work, but a job listing earlier this year teased a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVywzI"&gt;Microsoft has so far revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10, alongside File Explorer icon improvements, and more colorful &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; that appeared last year. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheXamlGuy/status/1385334869073567749"&gt;Rounded corners&lt;/a&gt; will also be a big part of Sun Valley, alongside changes to built-in apps and the Start menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHhIOJ"&gt;We’re expecting to hear more about Sun Valley at Microsoft’s Build conference later this month, or as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;dedicated Windows news event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google expects most staff to spend about three days per week in the office post-pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKNe_r6JP-hBMGcfwQ_OPCu5LLc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244868/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JJnYOp"&gt;Google expects 60 percent of its approximately 140,000 global employees to spend around three days in the office per week post-pandemic. The policy was announced in a company-wide memo by CEO Sundar Pichai, which was later published as a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1390110202435801089"&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt;. While Pichai said a majority of employees will come into the office “a few days a week,” 20 percent are expected to work from home permanently, with another 20 percent working from new office locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUxTvb"&gt;The search giant is the latest tech company to announce big shifts to its post-pandemic working culture. Microsoft will allow employees to freely work from home for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508964/microsoft-remote-work-from-home-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;up to 50 percent of the working week&lt;/a&gt;, or to work remotely on a permanent basis with their manager’s approval. Meanwhile Salesforce, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced"&gt;owner of Slack&lt;/a&gt;, has declared that the “9-to-5 workday is dead,” with the majority of its employees coming into the office between one and three days a week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256060/twitter-employees-work-from-home-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have announced similar plans to let employees work from home or work remotely indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qknj0n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;...spending time in another city for part of the year, or even moving there permanently. Google’s future workplace will have room for all of these possibilities. We’re moving to a hybrid work week with most Googlers in the office approximately 3 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1390110318538366976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lPQddi"&gt;While Google says the majority of its employees will work from the office around three days a week, it also says it’ll make it easier for employees to switch between offices or to work fully remotely. Employees will be able to apply to move offices with their manager’s approval, or to work entirely remotely. Meanwhile, a “work-from-anywhere weeks” policy will let Googlers temporarily work from places outside their main office for up to four weeks a year. Pichai says Google will provide more details on the changes by mid-June, around the same time it’s introducing process to allow employees to request office moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLnt5t"&gt;Pichai’s memo also briefly mentions the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"&gt;experiments with future hybrid workplaces&lt;/a&gt;. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/google-back-to-office-workers.html"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; outlined some of the design elements being explored, which include inflatable robot walls to create temporary divides between open plan desks, and a “fabric-based overhead air duct system” that can be unzipped and moved over a weekend to create new seating arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ecRXx"&gt;Google’s employees across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa were told to work from home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173994/google-coronavirus-north-american-employees-work-from-home-sick-leave-fund"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360713/google-office-reopening-april-covid-19"&gt;US offices opened on a limited basis&lt;/a&gt;, with employees asked to follow safety guidelines like wearing masks and practicing social distancing if they wanted to come in. In his memo, Pichai says that in places where Google has opened its offices almost 60 percent of employees have chosen to come back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5qCdQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0fMHK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo Switch can’t be stopped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpTBH9VuqolDJHRf4ug7_PzrLc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244781/jbareham_1492_170228_0126.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch sales fuel full year profits. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PcXptX"&gt;Nintendo Switch sales were up 44 percent percent from January to March compared to the same pandemic-impaired quarter from a year earlier. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210506e.pdf"&gt;Today’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; bring total Switch sales to 28.83 million for the fiscal year, up 37 percent compared to the 21 million Switch consoles the company shipped the year prior, and beating the company’s own revised forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88Dd9H"&gt;In February, Nintendo raised its annual forecast to 26.5 million Switch units for the fiscal year ending March 31st on the strength of increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number that had already been raised from 19 million units at the start of the year. The lifetime-to-date sales figure now stands at 84.59 million Switch units shipped worldwide since its launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14237060/nintendo-switch-console-launch-date-price-announced"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, creeping up on the Wii console’s 101.63 million lifetime sales mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rlIgWD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Game sales for the year also spiked by 37 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S14mA7"&gt;Game sales for the year also spiked by 37 percent, selling 230.88 million units compared to 168.72 million units in the previous fiscal year, led by &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; with 20.85 million units sold. Other notables were &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; (10.62 million units), &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Sta&lt;/em&gt;r (9.01 million units), and &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; (7.38 million units). Nintendo claimed 36 million-seller titles during the fiscal year, 22 from Nintendo and 14 by other publishers. Newly released &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury &lt;/em&gt;sold&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;5.59 million units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpoKgk"&gt;Looking forward, Nintendo is planning to release a blue Switch Lite in May. The company is also preparing global launches for additional first-party software titles, including &lt;em&gt;Miitopia&lt;/em&gt; in May, &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush &lt;/em&gt;in June, and&lt;em&gt; The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt; in July. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Shining Pearl&lt;/em&gt; are planned for late 2021. Nintendo says that it’s working with Niantic “to develop a new application featuring Pikmin for smart devices” that will be released in the second half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqyLfz"&gt;Nintendo’s full-year revenue increased to 1.76 trillion yen, up 35 percent compared to the 1.3 trillion yen earned last year, netting a full-year profit of 480.3 billion yen (about $4.4 billion). The company is forecasting sales of 1.6 trillion yen against 25.5 million Switch consoles for the year ending March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmoue7"&gt;Nintendo is rumored to be working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;a new Switch with 4K output&lt;/a&gt; that will better compete with more powerful Xbox and PlayStation consoles. It’s said to have a larger 7-inch 720p OLED panel built by Samsung that’s set to enter mass production in June for July assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
