    <title>Apple will reportedly scan photos stored on iPhones and iCloud for child abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eo4wHZ"&gt;Apple plans to scan photos stored on iPhones and iCloud for child abuse imagery, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/14440f81-d405-452f-97e2-a81458f5411f?accessToken=zwAAAXsXFw3Akc8URA-B1AVFL9OX4qgUWPVBHw.MEQCIAlL-dncQ3QfMOhh2uX_WQcMbz9dxjkEyYqIbvpX7pNnAiBPOFPraAkWgtfFk9Z_X3XiV5f1-mI4Mvos0mL8SCQqUg&amp;amp;sharetype=gift?token=076dc4a2-d758-4db8-8114-bc29b71cf72f"&gt;according the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new system could help law enforcement in criminal investigations but may open the door to increased legal and government demands for user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCd5ME"&gt;The system, called neuralMatch, will “proactively alert a team of human reviewers if it believes illegal imagery is detected, who would then contact law enforcement if the material can be verified,” the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; said. neuralMatch, which was trained using 200,000 images from the National Center for Missing &amp;amp; Exploited Children, will roll out first in the US. Photos will be hashed and compared with a database of known images of child sexual abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pv6k39"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The system will be used first in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VByGry"&gt;“According to people briefed on the plans, every photo uploaded to iCloud in the US will be given a ‘safety voucher,’ saying whether it is suspect or not,” the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; said. “Once a certain number of photos are marked as suspect, Apple will enable all the suspect photos to be decrypted and, if apparently illegal, passed on to the relevant authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__uo580rn63xk"&gt;John Hopkins University professor and cryptographer Matthew Green raised concerns about the system on Twitter Wednesday night. “This sort of tool can be a boon for finding child pornography in people’s phones,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1423075906894106625"&gt;Green said&lt;/a&gt;. “But imagine what it could do in the hands of an authoritarian government?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIfczG"&gt;“Even if you believe Apple won’t allow these tools to be misused [crossed fingers emoji] there’s still a lot to be concerned about,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1423079067805495296"&gt;he added&lt;/a&gt;. “These systems rely on a database of ‘problematic media hashes’ that you, as a consumer, can’t review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eIhPA"&gt;Apple already checks iCloud files against known child abuse imagery, like every other major cloud provider. But the system described here would go further, allowing central access to local storage. It would also be trivial to extend the system to crimes other than child abuse — a particular concern given Apple’s extensive business in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8MhAK"&gt;The company informed some US academics about it this week, and Apple may share more about the system “as soon as this week,” according to two security researchers who were briefed on Apple’s earlier meeting, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vurNuE"&gt;Apple has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; the privacy protections built into its devices, and famously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;stood up to the FBI&lt;/a&gt; when the agency wanted Apple to build a backdoor into iOS to access an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino. The company did not respond to a request for comment on the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A recall of Philips respiratory devices has left users stranded</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration of hand reaching to grab a CPAP mask that is dangling out of reach.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80TDLkZLtBVuRUdudn5LPz8qZvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69683573/acastro_210805_4695_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Over a month after the recall, people who rely on ventilators, CPAPs, and BiPAPs are unsure what to do &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8c52yj"&gt;Ingrid Tischer needs a machine to sleep. For nearly 30 years, she’s been using BiPAP devices, which push pressurized air into her lungs so she gets enough oxygen through the night. In June, a friend texted to tell her that Philips Respironics, one of the world’s biggest producers of respiratory devices, had recalled many of its ventilators, CPAPs, and BiPAPs. Her machine was on the list.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwipFp"&gt;The realization was terrifying. “I’d gotten through the wildfires, the pandemic, and then suddenly, it’s like, oh, the monster is not dead yet,” says Tischer. “But it feels like the call is coming from inside the house. It’s not out there. It’s in my home and on my face every night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POYkIq"&gt;During its &lt;a href="https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/corpcomms/news/press/2021/philips-first-quarter-results-2021.html"&gt;earnings report in late April&lt;/a&gt;, Philips noted concerns about the sound dampening foam in several of its machines. The foam could break down, sending debris and potentially toxic chemicals through the device’s airway that can then be swallowed or inhaled by the user. The degradation of the foam is exacerbated by high heat and humidity, worsening the risks for people in areas impacted by wildfires and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;record heatwaves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwZB2N"&gt;On June 14th, the company issued &lt;a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/e/sleep/communications/src-update"&gt;a recall notice&lt;/a&gt; for over a dozen of its ventilators and BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are used by millions of people at home, in hospitals, and in care facilities across the country. One model, the E30 ventilator, was on the list of ventilators &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/ventilators-and-ventilator-accessories-euas"&gt;granted Emergency Use Authorizations&lt;/a&gt; by the FDA during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL6KLF"&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/certain-philips-respironics-ventilators-bipap-and-cpap-machines-recalled-due-potential-health-risks#actions"&gt;gave the recall a Class I designation&lt;/a&gt;, the most serious type. The classification means there’s a reasonable probability that use of a recalled product “will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhNgjW"&gt;Philips estimates that 3 to 4 million devices are in use globally, around half of which are in the US. “We fully understand the impact that this is having on patients,” says Philips. “Our priority is to replace the foam in all the affected devices either by repair or replacement with like devices with the new foam.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5mq4oJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Respiratory equipment is not like a car that’s faulty”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l3u7bl"&gt;Yet over a month after the recall, people who rely on these devices to breathe are still scrambling to figure out what to do. Philips recommends that people &lt;a href="https://www.philipssrcupdate.expertinquiry.com"&gt;register their devices&lt;/a&gt; and follow the advice of their doctors when deciding whether to continue using them. But most people who use these devices can’t go without them, even temporarily. Just one night without a BiPAP is detrimental to Tischer’s health, and other people need their ventilators around the clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wM8AfU"&gt;“Respiratory equipment is not like a car that’s faulty,” says Tischer. “You can stop driving the car, but you can’t just postpone breathing. So we were given a really ridiculous thing that they called a choice, which was use it or don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjjhLN"&gt;Tischer was able to get a replacement after several calls with her medical equipment provider, insurance company, and doctor, but others haven’t been so lucky. Alice Wong, a disabled activist who uses two of the recalled ventilators, hasn’t gotten very far in her search for replacements. She received bacterial filters from her equipment provider, but the FDA hasn’t fully evaluated how effective such filters are for dealing with the degraded foam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gafwJ"&gt;The existence of the recall has been poorly communicated. Wong found out about it through a Facebook group for people with neuromuscular disabilities, not through her doctor or Philips. She &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SFdirewolf/status/1404817855464415234"&gt;tweeted a thread&lt;/a&gt; to spread the word and started the hashtag #SuckYouPhilips to collect people’s stories. Several people have described a frustrating loop of conversations with doctors, less than sympathetic medical equipment suppliers, and insurers, while often being unable to reach Philips through its hotline. “Many people are getting the runaround while a few were able to get a replacement machine from another manufacturer immediately,” says Wong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hk7uj4"&gt;Philips says it is “working to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,” and has increased the production capacity of repair kits and replacements. The company couldn’t offer a timeline, but says it is “in discussions with the relevant regulatory authorities to obtain authorization to start deploying the repair kits and replacement devices that we are already producing in large quantities.” Philips also says it has stopped taking orders for sleep therapy devices for new patients while production capacity is focused on repair and replacement efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JP23Bt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Disabled people have always been considered disposable by society”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYaNm3"&gt;The slow and convoluted process hasn’t been enough. “Disabled people have always been considered disposable by society,” says Wong, “and this is another ugly example of it.” She and others are calling on Philips to be more transparent about its plans for repairs and replacements. She says the company should pay for comparable machines from other manufacturers, reimburse people who purchased additional equipment out of pocket, and staff its phone line with people who have thorough information and resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKj5Dh"&gt;But even that wouldn’t address the larger problems at play. A small number of companies produce the majority of durable medical equipment like ventilators, and patients have little choice which machines they end up with based on their insurance. When one of those companies announces its products have dangerous defects, there’s not much of a contingency plan for the people who rely on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hL77ud"&gt;Wong is exhausted from &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/4/4/21204261/coronavirus-covid-19-disabled-people-disabilities-triage"&gt;living through a pandemic as a ventilator user&lt;/a&gt;, and the recall of devices she needs to live is another massive source of stress. “I have to breathe,” she says, “but breathing from a machine pumping carcinogenic particles into my lungs is my only option?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WnqCpr"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/3a9296a025f29934822e4182d9f80641/acastro_210805_4695_square.jpg" alt="Illustration of hand reaching to grab a CPAP mask that is dangling out of reach.

    <title>Here’s a closer look at Apple’s canceled AirPower wireless charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QQOmG8rcOgnCV7MM-h483vOKNfg=/0x117:3696x2581/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69683450/IMG_9512.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A working Apple AirPower prototype unit. | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giulio Zompetti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tAI3fQ"&gt;Apple’s AirPower wireless charger was supposed to arrive with the unique ability to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple canceled AirPower in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, citing difficulties in bringing the product to life. Since then, we’ve seen a &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/21/airpower-prototype-teardown-likely-shows-why-apple-never-shipped-the-wireless-charger/"&gt;teardown of AirPower&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/3/21047896/zens-liberty-airpower-clone-16-coils-wireless-charging-pad-mat"&gt;AirPower clones&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22576245/iphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack"&gt;MagSafe battery packs&lt;/a&gt;. Now, an Apple prototype collector has obtained a working AirPower unit for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsrd3I"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Giulio Zompetti, a 28-year-old from Italy, says he has been able to purchase a prototype AirPower unit from Chinese e-waste sources. “The unit lacks all of its exterior housing, and shows this beautiful and heavy stainless steel chassis,” says Zompetti.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SReGJYMIH7HhoqSVyid8OhAZSYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763582/airpowerprototype.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giulio Zompetti&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The controller circuits on an AirPower prototype.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5xgt0x"&gt;In photos supplied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, you can see the AirPower mat powering a prototype iPhone, with its 22 coils on the front-facing side and 22 controller circuits on the rear. In order for this AirPower prototype to work, it has to be paired with special prototype iPhone hardware to activate the coils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmfnSg"&gt;“It doesn’t work with production devices, because the coils are woken up by the device,” explains Zompetti, who says he’s been able to charge two prototype devices simultaneously so far. Zompetti says he received the unit in December and was able to interact with it initially through a serial lightning cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smo4LO"&gt;“It’s an engineering prototype, it’s not meant for plug and play,” says Zompetti. “When I connected my serial lightning cable to it, I could see some chars on the log, so once I fixed the BAUD rate, I was able to read a comprehensible log.” There’s even an interactive shell to interact with the AirPower, as part of the engineering of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tFjSoS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AirPower &lt;a href="https://t.co/bv8gi0NiiL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bv8gi0NiiL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1423277245381054472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YaNDpV"&gt;Apple’s canceled AirPower pad was supposed to let you drop devices anywhere on it to charge thanks to multiple coils, without having to find that specific sweet spot. But various reports suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869072/apple-airpower-overheating-issues"&gt;Apple was struggling with overheating issues&lt;/a&gt; during development. “I wasn’t able to reproduce the issue but still can’t say it isn’t there,” says Zompetti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vl6GFv"&gt;While we haven’t been able to independently verify the AirPower device as it’s extremely rare, Zompetti has a history of collecting Apple prototype hardware. He’s been collecting devices since March 2018, including a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3a89w8/this-is-a-rare-prototype-of-the-first-apple-watch"&gt;rare prototype of the first Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. “It became my main passion since then to find the most good looking prototypes,” says Zompetti. He’s collected around 35 units so far, with a variety of rare iPhone and iPod prototypes in his collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwOLl0"&gt;This passion has seen Zompetti travel to engineers for help repairing old devices. “It’s almost always about finding broken or incomplete units and fixing them to bring them back to life” says Zompetti. An unreleased AirPower device is “definitely among the best” prototype hardware he’s found so far, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD’s Ryzen 5000 processors with integrated graphics are now available to buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKf8Kr9W-_WIBI0JVezWjK5HEj8=/401x0:4720x2879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69683350/586681_vermeer_03_0014_5K.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bxMFDH"&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382081/amd-ryzen-5000-processor-apu-gpu-cpu-chips-oem-prebuilt-graphics"&gt;AMD announced&lt;/a&gt; versions of its Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs with integrated graphics cards, but it only made them available for prebuilt OEM systems, promising that it would sell the chips to consumers later this year. Well, “later this year” is today, with AMD now offering its &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-with-graphics"&gt;Ryzen 5000 G-Series&lt;/a&gt; APUs to anyone to buy, not just multimillion-dollar PC manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX9Frc"&gt;Right now, only two of the Ryzen 5000 G-Series chips are available to purchase on AMD’s website: the eight-core Ryzen 7 5700G for $359 and the six-core Ryzen 5 5600G for $259. Both chips, like the standard Ryzen 5000 CPUs, are built on AMD’s 7nm process with its Zen 3 architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yKPU2I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A good option if you don’t need a powerful GPU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UpSjC6"&gt;Right now, AMD is just selling those two models (the more powerful options in the Ryzen 5000 G-Series lineup). The Ryzen 3 5300G and Ryzen 3 5300GE are still listed on AMD’s site as “OEM only,” and the 35W GE versions of the 5700G and 5600G don’t seem to be available to purchase yet either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDfdME"&gt;The new chips are otherwise identical to the OEM counterparts that shipped earlier this year, meaning that they still use AMD’s older Vega graphics platform, not its cutting-edge RDNA / Navi process that’s found on the latest Radeon GPUs. But if you don’t need ultra-powerful graphics to run the latest AAA games at ultra settings, the new chips might be a good option to consider (especially considering how difficult it is to get ahold of a new GPU these days). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Free Guy is like a AAA game: fun, goofy, and doing narrative backflips to make a guy the lead</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4K7-OAqBJo1cPW5A7JE1-pFjXyA=/0x0:3072x2048/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69683233/DF_14069_R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M6Yxwj"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt;, Millie (Jodie Comer) is a game developer on the outs working to prove that publisher Antwan (a strutting Taika Waititi) illegally stole game code from her and her partner, Keys (Joe Keery) to create &lt;em&gt;Free City&lt;/em&gt;, the most popular video game in the world. She infiltrates the game, hunting for the evidence to prove that her original idea was stolen — evidence that she thinks is hidden somewhere deep inside the game itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozhST4"&gt;And you would think that the movie is about her, right? But &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; seems more focused on offering up Ryan Reynolds guilelessly moseying across the screen as the titular Guy, in what feels like a version of &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt; that swaps “charming, stop-motion-style Lego animation” for “video games” and throws in a heavy dose of &lt;em&gt;The Truman Show&lt;/em&gt; for good measure. The result is an enjoyable — albeit weird — but largely forgettable summer action movie. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8uH9rfhPV1nmQvgsocm1Yp4Ya7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763528/DF_26555_R.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yXZCap"&gt;Guy (Reynolds) is an oblivious NPC in &lt;em&gt;Free City&lt;/em&gt;, an incredibly popular video game that most accurately resembles &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;where human players run missions, robbing banks to get cash and generally causing mayhem. Guy, on the other hand, works at the bank, stamping generic forms and hanging out with his best friend, a security guard named Buddy (Lil Rel Howery.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNZxGq"&gt;But then his life changes when he runs into Millie, who awakens Guy to the possibilities of breaking his daily grind and being “the good guy” in the video game world of murderers and thieves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xmEGN"&gt;Reynolds is charming as ever, with &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; lending him the feature-length chance to turn his affable social media persona into the walking version of a smiley face. The problem is that Guy’s blank slate doesn’t leave much room for him to be an actual character: his entire character arc is just “being helpful,” and all his wants and desires are ingrained in his programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQ8vEY"&gt;Comer’s Millie — who has the benefit of actual agency and drive — ends up carrying the film both as her in-game action hero character and as a frustrated programmer who’s trying to fight for the right thing. Too bad the film is structured around Guy and his less than dynamic character arc. A version of this film might have existed where she was the narrative lead and he was the lovable side character, and it probably would have been a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XMtvofl69Y5BGSEAbBm3wrhVgbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763531/DF_29489_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Alan Markfield / 20th Century Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SDySJH"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; hides its heroine behind a charming Ryan Reynolds, it wears its gaming influences proudly: popular streamers like Ninja, Pokimane, Jacksepticeye, DanTDM, and LazarBeam all make appearances to comment on Guy’s in-game adventure and lend the fictional &lt;em&gt;Free City&lt;/em&gt; game the cachet of a real-world success like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUKwOH"&gt;As a whole, &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; is most successful when it lampoons the psychopathic tendencies of video game players in a real-world perspective. Living in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, where near-feral players tear through cities, murdering countless thousands of virtual avatars and causing wanton destruction, &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be horrifying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S0Be5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Living in a video game would be horrifying&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M1nxxe"&gt;Guy’s quest to be the good guy makes sense when faced with all that, but &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; isn’t quite willing to commit to that idea, descending back to standard action movie fare as soon as it suits the plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpnWrf"&gt;And that inconsistency appears throughout the film. &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt;’s villain —  scenery-devouring Taika Waititi, who looks to be having the most fun of anyone in the film (which is saying something in a movie starring the perpetually sunny Reynolds) — gives not one, but two speeches about corporate greed and spinning out endless sequels with familiar characters and properties to make money off an existing stable of IP instead of making something new and original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcKob5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; positions this as an ostensibly bad thing — only for the film to spin on its heels and throw in some of the most egregious cross-promotional references this side of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22577229/space-jam-a-new-legacy-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the final act. (It is possible to pinpoint the exact second of the post-production process that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt; was completed.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hy-MpnnIFYeypm9FTdbzgMfVUcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763534/DF_09845_R2.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="brGpas"&gt;After months away from theaters, &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; is definitely an enjoyable way to spend an hour or two at the movies. But, like an overproduced video game, it almost has too much stuff, bouncing between action and romance and comedy and screeds against making too many sequels to really do any one of those things overly well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="snpW3e"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on August 13th.&lt;/h4&gt;

    <title>Moderna says a third shot of its COVID-19 vaccine may be needed to protect against variants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus Vaccination " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNM2ad2ES4d3oZbyr85aeiqwfvI=/0x0:5100x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69682674/1234461740.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Moderna says a third shot of its COVID-19 may be needed against variants | Photo by Ivan Damanik/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bZ0Nrp"&gt;Pharmaceutical company Moderna said its COVID-19 vaccine is 93 percent effective through six months after the second dose, but as new variants of the virus emerge, people who received the vaccine may need a booster shot before winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7vedN"&gt;The company made the announcement as part of its &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial/"&gt;second-quarter earnings release&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWN7Mn"&gt;“We are pleased that our Covid-19 vaccine is showing durable efficacy of 93 percent through six months, but recognize that the Delta variant is a significant new threat so we must remain vigilant,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement with the earnings release. Moderna president Stephen Hoge said during an earnings call that a third booster “will likely be necessary to keep us as safe as possible through the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzYOSL"&gt;The company is studying what type of booster will provide the best long-term protection against the Delta variant and other possible variants of the coronavirus. Moderna said both a third shot of the original vaccine and new versions have demonstrated “robust antibody responses to COVID-19 variants of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YafzoL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Who needs COVID-19 boosters?  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22549336/covid-vaccine-booster-immunocompromised-antivirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="G2jdTU"&gt;On Wednesday, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-4-august-2021"&gt;asked for a moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on COVID-19 booster shots in higher-income countries, citing lower income countries’ lack of access to the vaccines. But White House press secretary &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/04/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-august-4-2021/"&gt;Jen Psaki said during a press briefing&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that the WHO was offering a “false choice,” noting that the US has already donated 110 million doses of the vaccine to other countries. “More needs to happen. But we believe we can do both,” Psaki added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrrCmp"&gt;Moderna said it sold $5.9 billion worth of its coronavirus vaccine during the six-month period ending June 30th, for a total of 302 million doses. The company reported a net income of $2.8 billion on total revenue of $4.4 billion for the three months ending June 30th, compared to $67 million in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing Ear 1 earbuds review: almost something</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Standout design, noise cancellation, and wireless charging for $99&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="88KQhG"&gt;There’s a lot riding on the Ear 1 wireless earbuds, which are the first product to come from Nothing — a new company created by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei. Backed with investment from GV, Tony Fadell, and influential creators like Casey Neistat, Nothing is aiming to build out an entire family of products that follow the design ethos debuting with the Ear 1. Transparency is at the heart of that: the Ear 1s have a clear “stem” that lets you peer at their internal components, and the unconventional charging case has a transparent lid to keep the buds in view at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzPGaQ"&gt;Pei has said his motivation for starting Nothing was a consumer tech industry that felt stale, unimaginative, and awash in gadgets that all feel very same-y. I don’t really buy into that viewpoint; sure, AirPods clones are everywhere, but the best earbuds from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and other big players are all visually distinct. Regardless, Nothing doesn’t see itself as “an audio company,” according to Pei, but the booming true wireless earbuds market seemed like an advantageous place to start. He’s also aiming to capture the same price-to-performance magic that was associated with OnePlus in its early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHScYa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10674787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TLb4Jn"&gt;At $99, the Ear 1s include active noise cancellation, wireless charging, IPX4 water resistance, and smaller conveniences like in-ear detection — features that cost anywhere from $150 to $300 from Nothing’s big brand competitors. Their sound has been tuned by Teenage Engineering, a company well versed in audio electronics. They’ll go on sale widely starting August 17th, but you can grab a pair early &lt;a href="https://nothing.tech/products/ear-1"&gt;from Nothing’s website on July 31st&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVLlJK"&gt;Like all transparent tech, the Ear 1s are fun to examine up close. On the outward-facing part of the stem, you can see the voice / ANC microphones, touch sensors, and a dot — red (right) or white (left) — to indicate which ear that bud is for. On the side facing your ear, there’s some circuitry, magnets, and the pins where the earbuds connect to the charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7WK0eaW7d1xhkIr1MKHtDYydsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746907/DSCF4391_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The outside of the Ear 1 casing reveals microphones, touch sensors, and a dot to indicate which ear that earbud is for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ke5V59"&gt;Nothing says it was so obsessive over small details (like polishing the magnets) that some manufacturing plants turned the startup away. Finding the right glue to bond the two sides of transparent casing together without leaving any ugly remnants behind was also apparently quite a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7055hWzYH9hYKZUtxwp0LzFNLM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746903/DSCF4362_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From some angles, the Nothing Ear 1s really are quite striking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Da4L4W"&gt;The Ear 1s definitely look &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;, but do they come off as radically different? I’m not seeing it. If the clear stem were opaque white instead, these earbuds would look just like Apple’s AirPods Pro or any number of competitors. Nothing’s early concept images &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;showed a more unorthodox design&lt;/a&gt;, but the final product looks mostly normal with a dash of unique style — and maybe that’ll be enough to sell some people on them. Not reinventing the wheel makes for good comfort, at least. Three sizes of silicone tips come in the box, and I found that the Ear 1s have a similar in-ear feel to the AirPods Pro. They fit snugly, feel airy light (each earbud is 4.7 grams), and didn’t come loose during runs or while I was eating, which are two scenarios where true wireless buds sometimes get dislodged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/weIkNSF-iGIznfNqCXShjTrtlQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746904/DSCF4370_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting a glimpse at all the internals takes some direct lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6UISkdmgr8rJ8jTEitKinCt9BA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747162/DSCF4404.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ear 1s are very light and comfortable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="myID1q"&gt;The charging case is where Nothing definitely gets more out there with design. It’s a squished-down square with rounded corners that opens and closes with satisfying spring tension. There’s a USB-C port for wired charging, and you also get Qi wireless charging; that’s always nice to see at this price. But for all the visual flair, it feels like I’m doing more work to seat the Ear 1s back in their case compared with other earbuds I’ve got around. The magnetic hold isn’t particularly strong, and laying the earbuds flat instead of plopping them into deep charging cradles takes more direct attention. The big dimple in the top of the case helps keep the earbuds in place, with a side effect of turning the case into a fun thing to fidget with and twirl around in your fingers. Still, I think Nothing could’ve come up with something more efficient and compact. This case is form over function and obviously intended to showcase Nothing’s transparent aesthetic. Just don’t expect it to stay pristine: my review unit has already collected scratches on the case’s bottom, and it’s only a matter of time before the top picks up some, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9Jr9X3Imygh7eNOCIm6UQgfIZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746902/DSCF4331_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From afar the stem looks mostly black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlD4yh"&gt;In terms of sound, the Ear 1s and their 11.6-millimeter drivers don’t pull off any huge upsets against more premium competition. But they also don’t sound &lt;em&gt;bad &lt;/em&gt;or “budget.” They’ve just got some weaknesses that earbud enthusiasts will pick up on. The treble and high end — particularly on acoustic-driven tracks — can occasionally come off as excessively sparkly. I listened through John Mayer’s 1980s-influenced &lt;em&gt;Sob Rock&lt;/em&gt; and while Nothing’s earbuds punched slightly above what I’d expect for $99 and had good clarity and a nice thump-y bass riding beneath everything, their warmth and detail don’t measure up to earbuds in the $200-300 range. But they’re still an enjoyable listen in many cases, which came through when I switched over to “Stop Making This Hurt” by Bleachers. The Ear 1s presented well with good stereo separation and nothing sounding muddled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Twn0c-dBoERdfppSqd1NX8_jGMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746960/DSCF4386_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds lay flat in the charging case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPnh21"&gt;Nothing’s companion mobile app is available for both Android and iOS and has simple EQ adjustments for “more treble,” “more bass,” and “voice,” but you can’t take full control over the sliders yourself. You might find yourself turning to that bass boost now and then. Nothing has said it and Teenage Engineering aimed for a natural, balanced sound signature, but don’t confuse that with flat or colorless. The earbuds support AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hkxgmo"&gt;Noise cancellation is… passable. On the “max” setting, it could eliminate low-frequency hums inside my local coffee shop, but I never really forgot about my surroundings. Overall noise isolation was solid thanks to the good seal I got from the ear tips, and I’d reach for these before the $99 Pixel Buds A-Series, which require me to crank the volume to overcome nearby noise. But Nothing isn’t on the same level as the similarly priced Amazon’s Echo Buds 2 when it comes to noise cancellation — not a surprise since this is the company’s first swing at it. Transparency mode is adequate, but doesn’t match the natural feel of the Echo Buds or Apple’s AirPods Pro. Nothing does include some nice tricks; if you take one earbud out, the other will switch into transparency mode until both are back in your ears. And they’ve got auto-pause / resume when an earbud is removed, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4sFsOb4_3pT2MfnSOA3_mMhvi4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746906/DSCF4377_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds have small vents to alleviate ear pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQ7GC-rLuBx_sHQWlKqT5JR--n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747169/DSCF4407_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case has a USB-C port, pairing button, and wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ojMLGO"&gt;Despite having three microphones and algorithms meant to help isolate your voice from background noise, the Ear 1s were a disappointment for voice calls. My voice came through muddled and warbly even in a quiet room when recording to voice memos, and people I called had difficulty hearing me clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tOVru"&gt;Nothing says the Ear 1s can last for four hours of continuous playback with ANC on, and the case has enough for 24 more hours. If you leave ANC off, those numbers increase to 5.7 hours and 34 hours, respectively. The battery estimates for listening time have seemed on point in my tests so far. The earbuds use tap controls for most functions: you tap twice to play / pause, three times to skip forward or go back to the previous song (depending on side), hold to toggle NC modes, and so on. But there’s also a swiping gesture up or down the stem to adjust volume, which has worked reliably and feels intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVgG8Q"&gt;Nothing is still working on the Ear 1s as they approach release. In my time testing them, I’ve certainly encountered bugs and sporadic issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="24TNLm"&gt;Transparency mode has gone on the fritz from time to time. Sometimes it activates unexpectedly when I’m on a call. In other, stranger instances, I’ve heard brief boosts of ambient sound when turning my head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5oRkki"&gt;I’ve noticed the earbuds seemingly switching modes between NC on and off on their own. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="76GEx5"&gt;Android Fast Pair isn’t yet functional. Nothing says this will be working by the time the Ear 1s ship to customers in mid-August. I’ll update the review once that happens. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Fha2eA"&gt;I encountered odd charging behavior with the case, where the LED wouldn’t reflect that anything was happening. A recent firmware update seems to have cleared this up for the most part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lqlAdZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10674672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpQT7CfT9FwmZzy0mKv08NvJYdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22747060/DSCF4365_20Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing has said its future products will look at home next to the Ear 1s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3UAD6"&gt;Nothing has already pushed out a couple firmware updates during my review period, and I’d expect more before the Ear 1s arrive to buyers. But these are my impressions as of the company’s late-July review embargo; I’ll update to mention any changes or improvements when the earbuds ship in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YgD6h9"&gt;With their full potential unrealized and performance still on the buggy side, it’s difficult to conclude whether the Ear 1s are putting Nothing on the right track as a new consumer tech brand. These earbuds offer an ambitious bundle of features for $99, and they’re inevitably going to get buzz and attention thanks to their transparent design (even if they resemble AirPods in other ways) and presence in swanky fashion storefronts like &lt;a href="https://kith.com/"&gt;Kith&lt;/a&gt;. The Ear 1s are the new hypebeast earbuds and have a fun air of freshness. But right now, their individual parts — sound quality, noise cancellation, etc. — fall short of excellence and leave plenty of reason for sticking with one of those “boring” established players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon launches new resale programs to cut down warehouse waste</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon fulfillment centre" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VTWKvhU5MwIQ5rLk1j6Hgwnse0U=/27x0:3474x2298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69682561/874774828.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2oQtt"&gt;Amazon announced new efforts that might be able to prevent some overstocked and returned items from becoming trash. It launched two new programs that are intended to make it easier for third-party retailers to sell returned goods and unsold inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8X5JC"&gt;The moves come in the wake of several separate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543527/amazon-unsold-products-destruction-investigation"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon warehouses that found that many returned and unsold items were labeled for destruction. Businesses that use Amazon to sell their products pay to hold their stock in Amazon warehouses. When those goods don’t sell, or if returned items pile up, they might decide to chuck the products to save money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsftAC"&gt;Amazon’s new “Grade and Resell” initiative will now give third-party sellers in the UK the option to sell stuff that’s been returned as “used.” Sellers can choose to funnel returned items to the new program, where Amazon will give the “used” item a rating: “Like New,” “Very Good,” “Good,” or “Acceptable.” The third-party seller can then set pricing based on the rating and sell it as they would a new item. The program is supposed to be available in the US later this year, Amazon says. It’s also expected to go live in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain by early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sHPFKi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0oIjC"&gt;Another new program tries to make it easier for sellers to liquidate extra inventory. They can now sell overstocked and returned goods to wholesalers through Amazon. This option is now available in the US, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. It’s scheduled to come to the UK later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftqYaM"&gt;A June investigation pulled back the curtain on one “destruction zone” in Amazon’s Dunfermline fulfillment center in Scotland. The e-commerce giant marked millions of unsold products there for destruction each year, British television program &lt;a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ITV News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4O520"&gt;“I used to gasp. There’s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed: Dyson fans, Hoovers, the occasional MacBook and iPad; the other day, 20,000 Covid (face) masks still in their wrappers,” said a former Amazon employee who spoke anonymously to &lt;em&gt;ITV News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sgJrb"&gt;In 2019, Amazon started a program for third-party sellers to donate leftover stock in its US and UK warehouses. But far fewer items in Dunfermline were earmarked for donation than for destruction, the &lt;em&gt;ITV News&lt;/em&gt; report found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILXqnn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPzZwR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abC7SK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A three-pack of Google Wifi mesh routers is just $150 at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YO-_qyVzxOFY_-xyL_YzeidTBs0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69682390/dseifert_161205_1307_0004.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjaU66"&gt;If you have a solid internet connection, you owe it to yourself to get a mesh Wi-Fi system. It’ll help to cover more of your apartment or home in fast Wi-Fi. You can get Google’s Wifi &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GG9CMLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a three-pack for $150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from $200. This 25 percent discount is the biggest price markdown yet. And considering that Google sells a single Wifi unit for $100, it doesn’t make much sense to opt for that when you can get another two for just $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FySdyE"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s newer Nest Wifi&lt;/a&gt; does offer better range and more features than this product, but these are still worth getting if you’re on a budget (not to mention, it’s cross-compatible with Nest Wifi, should you ever upgrade). Each Google Wifi router has dual gigabit ethernet ports, and plugs in via a 15W power adapter. Unlike the previous iteration of this product that Google released in 2016, this slightly updated version that launched in 2020 has a tweaked logo, and Google says that 49 percent of its plastic part weight is made with recycled material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cNunrk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ceX8Md"&gt;I said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;in May 2021&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft’s once-pricey Surface Duo was finally the cost of a normal phone. But now, it’s the cost of a midrange phone at Woot through the end of the day, or until it sells out. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-dual-screen-att-lte-tablets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The AT&amp;amp;T-locked version of the phone with 128GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; is just $398 new at Woot, while the 256GB version is $470. These are the lowest prices yet, but keep in mind that Microsoft has yet to deliver on promises of Android 11 software. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;recent rumors might be pointing to a newer model on the horizon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JLRELv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10517551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jItbjO"&gt;There’s another phone deal happening on the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra with 128GB of storage at Amazon. Usually $1,200, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Pro-Grade-SM-G998UZKEXAA/dp/B08P54F6HB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can pick it up for $950&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $25 above the lowest-ever price. This phone will work with any US carrier via LTE, as well as with all US carriers that offer 5G. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ut8GLC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215736"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vrl4YU"&gt;Apple AirPods Max over-ear headphones still aren’t in what’d I’d call “affordable” territory, though the price is getting cheaper week to week. At a retailer called Simply Mac, &lt;a href="https://store.simplymac.com/products/apple-airpods-max"&gt;you can snag a set at $440&lt;/a&gt; — the lowest price yet — by adding them to your cart and entering the code &lt;strong&gt;INSTA20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EcwLNP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nU7TDV"&gt;Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; for the Switch console &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5OKGLH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $46 today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It has been this price before, but it’s worth alerting you to this deal, in case you’ve recently picked up a Switch. This is the latest version of the game, and it earns its namesake as the ultimate version of &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, with more characters, stages, and modes than any of its predecessors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kzygfT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="clP3ll"&gt;Much to our dismay, Sonos products rarely go on sale. However, if you happen to be a Costco member, you can purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.100513510.html"&gt;Sonos Beam Shadow Edition for $370&lt;/a&gt; either in-store or online. While not as immersive as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features"&gt;higher-priced Sonos Arc&lt;/a&gt;, the Beam is still a notable upgrade for listeners who still rely on their TV speakers, with excellent sound, a clean design, and support for Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and AirPlay 2. Costco’s so-called Shadow Edition is no different — the exterior is just dark gray instead of black or white. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I3l6wh"&gt;If you haven’t yet seen &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt;, the brilliant 2021 film about a Korean-American family struggling to make a living while finding purpose and happiness in the Ozarks, you can rent it for just $1 for the next few days through myriad streaming services (it was recently $20 to rent, since it skipped theaters). Check it out in 4K UHD at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WM12N1Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vudu.com%2Fcontent%2Fmovies%2Fdetails%2FMinari%2F1650962&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F5%2F22610997%2Fgoogle-wifi-mesh-routers-microsoft-surface-duo-samsung-galaxy-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vudu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fmovie%2Fminari%2Fid1549611916&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F5%2F22610997%2Fgoogle-wifi-mesh-routers-microsoft-surface-duo-samsung-galaxy-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fminari%2F8d6kgwxn8060%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Minari?id=ft2C0LLXSGM.P&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Nest cameras and doorbell have lower prices and more smarts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSXX1kcFMZiaffGpS9h3NXl4kn8=/0x383:5000x3716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69682323/Nest_Cam__battery__Indoor__5X4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Cam&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bynt9u"&gt;Google has announced a new line of home security cameras and a video doorbell under its Nest brand. The new models, which include an indoor-only camera, an indoor / outdoor camera, a floodlight, and the video doorbell, replace the older &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15881258/nest-cam-iq-home-security-camera-review"&gt;Nest IQ cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;Nest Hello doorbell&lt;/a&gt;. The main themes with the new devices are a unified design language and more accessible pricing — each model costs less than the camera it’s replacing, while adding more capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MCo0U"&gt;The design of the new cameras will be familiar to anyone who’s seen other Nest products released in the past couple of years, such as the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest WiFi&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; smart speaker. The company has been moving toward softer edges and muted color palettes, and the new cameras adhere to that with color options that are meant to blend in, not stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8C0m0j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design echoes what Google has done with other recent Nest products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gx5Fj"&gt;Google is also adding a bit more intelligence to the cameras, thanks to advances in on-device machine learning. The new models can detect people, animals, packages, and vehicles and provide specific alerts for each of them without the need for cloud processing (or its related subscription costs). (The Familiar Faces feature, which uses cloud-based facial recognition, still requires a paid plan.)  The idea behind it all is to cut down the noise from constant motion notifications, a common complaint with home security cameras and video doorbells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBwg2y"&gt;Google says the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in the new cameras allows the algorithms to run on twice as many pixels and at twice the frame rate of previous Nest Cams, which provides more reliable event detection and alerts, similar to how a TPU will improve the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;upcoming Pixel 6 smartphone’s capabilities&lt;/a&gt;. The cameras also include three hours of event history without a subscription and have internal storage for up to an hour of event clips (roughly equivalent to a week of events) in case the Wi-Fi goes down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ojxpjm"&gt;Lastly, Google is pitching versatility with this lineup, as both the doorbell and the new Nest Cam can be used in either battery-powered or wired configurations. There is also a range of accessories available for wall or table mounting, or setting up a camera indoors or out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGUBgL"&gt;What you won’t see emphasized with the new models is 4K resolution or spec-race hardware advancements. Google says the tradeoff required for 4K video — higher bandwidth consumption, larger cloud storage costs — outweighs the benefits. Plus, Google believes things like better HDR processing and smarter notifications are more helpful than just increasing the resolution would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fXhxxg"&gt;Google Nest Cam&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lcnsNOHMjXHe6lakQSL7CnyCrJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762374/Nest_Cam__battery__Outdoor_rain_16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Cam can be used indoors or out and has a weather-sealed design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aqeDGT"&gt;The centerpiece of the lineup is the new $179.99 Nest Cam, which can be used indoors or out. (Sophie Le Guen, Google’s lead product manager for Home and Nest products, tells me that outdoors is where the company is seeing the most interest and growth in security cameras.) It has an internal battery that the company claims lasts up to three months between charges with typical usage. It can also be wired into permanent power; an optional weatherproof power cable or solar panel is available for outdoor installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyJPHv"&gt;The Nest Cam has a soft, rounded design partially made with recycled plastic, but it maintains IP54 weather sealing. Google says its magnetic mounting base has been tested to withstand storm force winds and there will be an anti-theft mount that can be used to make sure the camera isn’t stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoB_ZIDeZpbXOV-ZdMe_gq3LtKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762376/Nest_Cam__battery__with_stand__separate_accessory__16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam’s magnetic base makes it easy to mount to a wall or place on a shelf.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1xiF0w"&gt;The camera records 16:9 1080p video at up to 30fps through a 130-degree field of view. You can zoom up to 6x digitally in the Google Home app when viewing the feed or a recorded clip. Should you need more than the three hours of event history (clips of events that happened within the past three hours) included for free, you can pay for a Nest Aware or Aware Plus subscription that offers up to 10 days of 24/7 recording and 60 days of event history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwvtWJ"&gt;The new Nest Cam is available in white and can be preordered starting today, August 5th, with shipments expected to begin on August 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2GCcPa"&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9nlQpufaIKWiY0J-w66awyOr7NQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762385/Nest_Cam_with_Floodlight__US_SKU__night_close__16X9.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JqogeW"&gt;The $279.99 Nest Cam with Floodlight is Google’s first connected floodlight camera and fills a gap in the lineup that other companies have addressed for some time now. Effectively, it’s a Nest Cam attached to a 2400 lumen floodlight. It requires permanent power — no battery option here — and features IP65 weather resistance rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwim77"&gt;Unlike standard floodlights, which get triggered by any sort of motion, the Nest Cam with Floodlight can use the same intelligence available in the other cameras to only activate when it detects a person or vehicle. This separates it from other floodlight cameras, such as the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro, which turns on and records a clip for any motion it detects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpl7EZ"&gt;Google says the Nest Cam with Floodlight will be available at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1vU9HD"&gt;Google Nest Cam Indoor&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJA66OhWE8Xiz9dPzmQxlFFppwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762386/NestCam_wired__Colors_Snow_SandMaple_Linen_Fog_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam Indoor is much smaller than the standard Nest Cam and comes in four colors to better match your interior decor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zYJf0s"&gt;The simplest and least expensive new camera in the lineup is the $99.99 Nest Cam Indoor. A much smaller camera than the standard Nest Cam, the indoor model lacks the battery and weather sealing of the more expensive model, but maintains the same camera specs and intelligence features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTZWFP"&gt;The Nest Cam Indoor will be available in four colors (white, pink, beige, or green) to better match your decor or other Nest products you might have in your home. There’s also an optional wooden base available for it and the camera can be placed on a table or mounted on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIMEWP"&gt;The Nest Cam Indoor is expected to be available at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vEzJwF"&gt;Google Nest Doorbell&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDb95ZV0_R4i0lqH5_AFg-47E14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762387/Nest_Doorbell__battery___Snow__buttonpress__perspective__16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell is Google’s first battery-powered video doorbell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2vGdTO"&gt;The $179.99 Google Nest Doorbell is the first video doorbell from the company to work on either battery or wired power. (The $229.99 Nest Hello doorbell from 2018 was limited to wired-only configurations.) It’s compatible with more homes than Nest’s earlier doorbell and comes in four colors (white, beige, green, or gray) to better match your entrance decor. Google says typical battery life is about two and a half months between charges, though that is impacted by how busy your doorway is and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAM3WJ"&gt;The Nest Doorbell has a 3:4 tall aspect ratio, similar to the old Nest Hello, which Google says allows you to see visitors head to toe and packages that are as close as eight inches from the door. The vertical field of view reaches 145 degrees, though it’s not clear how wide the horizontal field of view is. (A mounting wedge is included in the box to adjust its viewing angle for different entrances.) The Nest Doorbell can record 960 x 1280 pixel video at up to 30 frames per second and has both night vision and HDR capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ql2EjxMZzxtuEifFwM4R5WHYSeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762389/Nest_Doorbell_battery__Colors_Snow_Linen_Ash_Ivy_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell is available in four different colors: white, beige, gray, or green.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vgAWxa"&gt;Like the new Nest Cam, the Nest Doorbell includes up to three hours of event video history out of the box, but you can subscribe to a paid plan for longer storage (you can’t get 24/7 video history on the Doorbell, however). One of the biggest benefits for the original Nest Hello was how quickly it provided notifications or a live feed on a Nest Hub smart display after the bell was rung compared to other video doorbells — we’ll have to see if the Nest Doorbell maintains that performance when running on battery power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKes9o"&gt;The Nest Doorbell can be preordered starting today, August 5th, with shipments expected to begin on August 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gf7ctb"&gt;
&lt;p id="jbwIM5"&gt;The new cameras fill some obvious gaps in Google’s smart home lineup and make it more competitive with Ring and others that have had floodlight cameras and battery-powered doorbells for years now. The lower prices also make the cameras more accessible than before, though they aren’t nearly as affordable as the cameras available from Wyze and other smaller brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGGL6k"&gt;But if you’ve got a smart home that centers around the Google Assistant, cheaper budget cameras or Ring products won’t work as well for you and you certainly won’t have as cohesive of an experience as you’d get with Google’s own devices. We’ll see just how good that experience is when we get a chance to review the new cameras in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
