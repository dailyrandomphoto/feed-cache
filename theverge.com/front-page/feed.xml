    <title>Twitter introduces aliases for contributors to its Birdwatch moderation program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZzt7fqQrgd--ufkzt3cS8DIob0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179078/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has introduced aliases for contributors in its Birdwatch moderation program  | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="id__b5ettyb57bw"&gt;Twitter is introducing aliases for participants in its Birdwatch moderation tool so they don’t have to include their usernames in notes they leave on others’ tweets, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/contributing/aliases/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post Monday. The social media platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;launched the pilot of Birdwatch in January&lt;/a&gt; as a way to crowdsource fact-checking on tweets that might contain misleading or inaccurate information. But the company said contributors in the pilot Birdwatch program “overwhelmingly voiced a preference for contributing under aliases. This preference was strongest for women and Black contributors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2TrHUP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Introducing Birdwatch aliases!  We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing to Birdwatch, and aliases let you write and rate notes without sharing your Twitter username. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ROlbpYvT7u"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ROlbpYvT7u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Birdwatch (@birdwatch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch/status/1462834006618214400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gfux2L"&gt;Twitter said its research shows that aliases have the potential to reduce bias by putting the focus not on the author of a Birdwatch note but on the note’s content. It also found that aliases may help to “reduce polarization by helping people feel comfortable crossing partisan lines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIIWgD"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;introduced a pilot of the Birdwatch program in January&lt;/a&gt;, which allows participating users to fact-check tweets and add notes with additional context. Birdwatch participants can also rate each others’ notes. The notes aren’t otherwise visible on Twitter but are displayed on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/download-data"&gt;the public Birdwatch website&lt;/a&gt;. Applicants to the Birdwatch program are asked to promise to act in good faith and “be helpful, even to those who disagree,” as &lt;a href="https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/contributing/values/"&gt;conditions for participating&lt;/a&gt;: “Genuinely and constructively contribute to help others stay informed. Do not attempt to game or manipulate the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKy9t5"&gt;Twitter also said Monday it was rolling out Birdwatch profile pages “to ensure this change doesn’t come at the expense of accountability.” This will make users’ past Birdwatch contributions visible and allow contributors to be “accountable” to the ratings their notes receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKl2Vz"&gt;For people participating in the Birdwatch pilot who contributed under their Twitter usernames prior to Monday, all previous contributions will now appear to come from whatever alias they choose, not their Twitter username. “That said, if someone who previously read one of your notes happened to recall the username that wrote it, they could possibly infer your alias,” the company noted, adding that users could opt to delete all of their prior Birdwatch contributions by contacting Twitter directly in a DM to @birdwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Over a million GoDaddy WordPress customers had email addresses exposed in latest breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ArEu7HePWjbZPOYXOygek0XYUq4=/93x0:1089x664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178904/Screen_Shot_2020_01_14_at_11.10.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GoDaddy via FastCompany&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lDS0D9"&gt;GoDaddy has suffered a security breach that gave an attacker access to more than 1 million email addresses belonging to the company’s active and inactive Managed WordPress users, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971121000122/gddyblogpostnov222021.htm"&gt;a disclosure it filed with the SEC&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Apbu"&gt;The company says the attacker gained access to a provisioning system (meant to set up and automatically configure new sites when customers create them) in early September by “using a compromised password.” GoDaddy says that it noticed the intrusion on November 17th and immediately locked the attacker out before beginning an investigation and contacting law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mKhoeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The compromised password gave the attacker access to emails and much more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9lrGX5"&gt;The hackers had access to more than just the email addresses — they could also see the original WordPress admin passwords set by the provisioner, as well as the credentials for active users’ databases and sFTP systems. The company also says that some customers had their private SSL keys exposed, which are responsible for proving that a website is who it says it is (powering the little lock icon you often see in your browser’s address bar). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyFkNb"&gt;According to GoDaddy, it’s working to mitigate the issues by resetting affected passwords and regenerating security certificates if needed. The company also says that it’s “contacting all impacted customers directly with specific details.” While those seem like appropriate steps, having to deal with a reset password will probably be a nuisance for some of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJrXEM"&gt;GoDaddy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about how the attacker gained access to the password the company says was used to gain access to its systems. Its announcement does say, however, that its investigation is ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvF2nW"&gt;In recent intrusions at other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348974/twitter-spear-phishing-attack-bitcoin-scam"&gt;phishing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770861/robinhood-7-million-customers-hacker-breach-extortion-security"&gt;social engineering&lt;/a&gt; has been to blame (though there have also been instances of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277300/florida-water-treatment-chemical-tamper-teamviewer-shared-password"&gt;simply poor password security&lt;/a&gt;). GoDaddy itself has some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22199406/godaddy-wins-2020-stupidity-award"&gt;pretty upsetting history&lt;/a&gt; with testing its employees’ cybersecurity awareness when it comes to fake emails, but attackers really only need to get lucky once to access treasure troves of data. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qbwNvRtOz3aWm0Swd3D9CY2VoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166146/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The AirPods Pro with the MagSafe charging case are on sale for just $190 at Amazon. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals across all brands.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHxEoXqr1i6JVkup6wsoJeDPpyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/best_phone_grid_16x9.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best budget phones of 2021: iiPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a 90Hz screen, or 5G support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WJAPbS"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget this holiday season, we’ve got good news: you’re more likely to find mid-range sub-$500 phones available than many of the hottest flagships of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY6SyC"&gt;Due to an unfortunate series of events — from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;ongoing chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, labor shortage, the pandemic, and global shipping delays — retailers are having a hard time keeping phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 or iPhone 13 Pro in stock; Samsung has been hit particularly hard with supply issues all year. Fortunately, there are many excellent alternatives that are nearly as capable and cost a lot less to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU3Cg6"&gt;Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are also finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with lower prices and more premium features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoCnCZ"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone&lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;much harder. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything well at this price point. So prioritize the features that matter most to you, whether it’s 5G compatibility with a particular network, high-resolution screen, low price, best camera, or longevity with software updates. It’s difficult to get straight A’s in every single one of these needs, but if you’re able to tolerate the occasional B, you’ll find a phone you’ll love. We recommend getting an unlocked phone for the best price and portability, but you might find better deals by buying through a carrier and signing up for a wireless plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Svhy7y"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;If you’re looking for the best budget Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice. You’ll find an all-around good phone with a flagship-level camera, three years of software updates from Google, plus IP67 water resistance — all at a lower price than last year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best iPhone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QjIUAS"&gt;Apple’s iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation) strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YYEN"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today, which also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High-refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, but you won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TvHua"&gt;The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is two years behind the latest and greatest and won’t win any benchmark races. (That would be the A15 chipset in the iPhone 13 lineup.) It’s still plenty performant, though, and it’s often hard to tell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="878itp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x5bwzf"&gt;the difference between a two-year-old iPhone processor and a brand-new one in use. But why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in comparison to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUd3WA"&gt;Cellular connectivity is limited to LTE, which is fine for now but might be limiting in a few years when 5G networks become more widely available. If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LCnMV"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sub-$500 Android phone, the Pixel 5A is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZV88A"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A has a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery, too: a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD7mEy"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor. The 5A’s dual rear-facing cameras (main and ultrawide), Snapdragon 765G processor, as well as the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combination, were inherited from the 4A 5G and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4bk7u"&gt;Software is another area where Pixel phones shine, and the 5A is no exception. It launched with Google’s own Android 11 OS and has already gotten upgraded to Android 12. The software is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uppsrx"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but you will be able to access the slower but more common, sub-6GHz 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7fhLs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cubsS1"&gt;But there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using in the near future called the C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release: it isn’t being sold through any of the major US carriers, but you can buy it from the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-5a-5g?id=CR6HaBzv0AUAEggeh2gc79AFAA%3D%3D"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/a&gt;. All in, the Pixel 5A is still the budget Android phone we’d recommend. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best phone display for $500 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qpM5xB"&gt;If you’re looking for the best display for your money, the $500 Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great option for future-proofing your phone, albeit at the very top of this buying guide’s price range, but it’s well worth its higher price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpya2a"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now, the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99z3je"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise, everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating are handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIU18y"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="85J3ce"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ZNpo"&gt;includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 5A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INZwJl"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by, so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;Best 5G phone for under $300 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpXOg"&gt;At $299, the OnePlus N10 5G brings 5G and some upscale features to a budget phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge4QQF"&gt;While you won’t find a fantastic screen here, its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits and only supports sub-6Hz 5G networks. It launched with Android 10, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XlPkb6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4Y1Qv"&gt;OnePlus has released the update to Android 11 already. But that’s it — don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model. OnePlus is offering two years of security updates in addition to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FucmrC"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 5A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB1WYg"&gt;If you prefer Samsung phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth your consideration for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive at $279 and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nicer features, like a higher refresh rate screen, good cameras, and a nicer implementation of Android. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtHJH"&gt;What if both the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G are just beyond your budget, but you still want a 5G-ready phone in this price bracket? Luckily for you, the unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; retails for $240 (or lower from carriers) and includes some fancy features as well. You’ll be treated to a 1080p display that refreshes at 90Hz and a 5,000mAh battery, but it only includes 64GB of internal storage. Yes, it only works on T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz 5G network but will function as a 4G phone on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. For the price, it’s not a bad way to get in on all the 5G action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="npapoA"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, and good battery life, all for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRkfu4"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’ vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HhlvTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rA2h68"&gt;While the 20S’ camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLPoSw"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice that should work on all major 4G networks in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;The best budget phone with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MC6Jne"&gt;It’s slim pickings for Android users who want a new budget phone with a stylus. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;LG exiting the smartphone market this year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;Samsung pausing (or perhaps ending) its premium Galaxy Note series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only Motorola’s Moto G Stylus left to hold the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Y0rd"&gt;Of the Motorola budget devices we’ve tested this year, the Moto G Stylus (2021) offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It’s a good phone for $280, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just stylus-curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyyTGB"&gt;It has a big 6.8-inch LCD display at 1080p resolution, good battery life with its 4,000mAh cell, and ample internal storage with 128GB of capacity. Thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 processor and 4GB of RAM, the G Stylus performs just fine with the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3VEksQ"&gt;occasional hiccup. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44WwOS"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ stylus is built into the device like the Galaxy Note. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps, like its coloring book app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;There’s no telling how much longer Motorola will make the Moto G Stylus, so if you want a budget phone with a built-in stylus, you should grab one while you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. TCL 20SE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The best 4G phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3LcHIR"&gt;There are not many great phones available in the sub-$200 range, but the $190 TCL 20SE is a rare gem of its class. It has a 5,000mAh battery, ample onboard storage, and a beautiful “nano-photoetched” back that makes this budget phone look more expensive than it is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPgkC4"&gt;As the most affordable model of the TCL 20 series, the TCL 20SE has a gigantic 6.82-inch display that is quite low in resolution at 720p but delivers brighter and more vibrant colors than other phones in its class — thanks to TCL’s television screen expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbBgrN"&gt;The 20SE’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor is supported by 4G of RAM, where they work well enough together to make &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; mostly playable, albeit with a slight lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7K8RPt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This budget phone looks more expensive than it is&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeESwB"&gt;Unlike other budget phones in this space, the 20SE comes with a generous 128GB of internal storage, plus a micro SD card slot for even more capacity. In addition, its 5,000mAh battery lasted a whopping 32 hours on one charge, using only Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1o43"&gt;While the 20SE’s 48-megapixel main camera can take great snaps in natural light, it’s not really meant for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfkexN"&gt;All things considered, TCL 20SE is a smart choice for a sub-$200 4G phone, especially If you won’t be using Verizon as your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;However, if you’re on an even tighter budget and need a 4G phone that will work on all the major carriers, you should consider Motorola’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787370/moto-g-pure-review-4g-android-budget-phone"&gt;Moto G Pure&lt;/a&gt;. Retailing at $160 for the unlocked version, you may be able to find deals as low as free at some carriers — if you sign up for a plan this holiday season. While the Moto G Pure is slower and smaller than the TCL 20SE, it has a more capable 13-megapixel main camera (f/2.2 aperture) that works admirably in low-light situations. Unfortunately, the G Pure only comes with a paltry 32GB of internal storage, so you’ll need to budget for a microSD card to expand its extremely limited capacity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Friday 2021 smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzBxpdIVD7rM7z674DaQ5xUPd_E=/0x0:6033x4022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178330/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 8 is one of many smart speakers and displays on sale this smart home buying season.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great bargain on smart cameras, robot vacuums, and even a smart mop. Here’s our roundup of the best deals on smart home gear you can buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQmoq2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more Black Friday deals? Be sure to check out our continuously updated roundup of all the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best early Black Friday sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero’s mesh Wi-Fi products are 40 percent off right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lKgkN0"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KckJmY"&gt;The foundation of any smart home is good Wi-Fi, and if you’re looking to start out or are having trouble with connections in your home, a mesh Wi-Fi router is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fos0TC"&gt;Eero Pro 6 is offering up to 40 percent off its excellent mesh Wi-Fi routers that have Thread radios built-in (and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero has said will get upgraded to the new smart home standard Matter&lt;/a&gt;, when it arrives next year). The Eero Pro 6 two pack is selling for $299, a savings of $100, and the Eero 6 two pack is down to $167 from $279, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://eero.com/sale?utm_source=eero+Home+WiFi+System&amp;amp;utm_campaign=454108a917-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_11_19_04_22&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_22bdbdc347-454108a917-162523809&amp;amp;mc_cid=454108a917&amp;amp;mc_eid=3e134bd98f"&gt;Eero&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Read our Eero review.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="X69mMR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Iowp5C"&gt;Google has discounted its Nest Wifi mesh networking system this week. Save $100 off a router and two points (now $249, regularly $349), both of which also double as Google Nest smart speakers.

&lt;h2 id="NR9KWv"&gt;Smart security camera and security system deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eZyOKA"&gt;The cheapest Ring video doorbell, Ring Video Doorbell Wired, gets even cheaper with an $18 price cut to $41.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Wired/dp/B08CKHPP52?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ring Wired uses existing doorbell wiring and works over 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alHazy"&gt;For a battery-powered option, the new Blink video doorbell is just $34.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $10, and it can also be wired if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Ijz8w"&gt;The tiny Blink Mini camera is selling for an even tinier price. Just $20 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=Blink+Mini+camera&amp;amp;qid=1637362943&amp;amp;s=hi&amp;amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTlU1UkdWSDlQNEVUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTU2MzUzMjBZTkhCTDhBUEtVUiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTcwOTU3MjdGVkVTRzBNVTc0QiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, down from $34.99, this is the cheapest indoor smart security camera you can buy right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QsMbFF"&gt;For outside surveillance, Google’s very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nest Cam with floodlight&lt;/a&gt; is $50 off ($229.99 instead of $279.99), and this deal can be found at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3r1JbYWRz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll want to make sure you can mount this on the side of your house first, as it has a rather awkward under-the-eave install. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of this floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div id="2CyBiw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PyzsDl"&gt;Abode’s great little Abode Cam 2, an indoor / outdoor camera that works with or without an Abode system, is $24.95 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abode.&lt;/a&gt; If you want to add a security system, too, Abode has an excellent bundle exclusively &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website for $299&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $300. It includes the Abode Cam 2, the security gateway, a keypad, two door sensors, a motion sensor, a keyfob, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; an Echo Show 5, with the option of professional monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9F8lFk"&gt;Another smart security deal is the Ecobee SmartCamera with voice control for $69.99 (regularly $99.99). This versatile indoor camera works with Alexa, Google, and HomeKit.

Find the deals at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fcameras%2Fsmart-camera-with-voice-control%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789311%2Fblack-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-SmartCamera-Control-Built-Security/dp/B087D6DRCC/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3r5PeL3Eo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; through Wednesday, December 1st.&lt;/li&gt;

You can get the basic five-piece kit for $80 off ($119 instead of $199) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Alarm-8-piece-kit/dp/B07ZPMCW64?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight-piece for $100 off &lt;/a&gt;($149.99 instead of $249.99) through November 29th at &lt;a href="https://ring.com/products/security-system-alarm-5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Alarm-5-piece-kit/dp/B07ZDTXJ93?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Level’s line of invisible smart locks rarely goes on sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ncjqi1"&gt;Smart locks and robot vacuum deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="JEwGgK"&gt;If you’re looking to upgrade your door lock, the Level Lock is a very good, usually very pricey solution. The Level Lock Touch Edition is currently on sale for $246.80, a savings of $80, which allows touch-to-open, access with a key card, as well as app, voice, and regular key control. If you don’t want the touch option, the regular Level Lock is down to $186.80 (from $249), and if you want to keep your existing lock, the Bolt that just replaces the inner workings of your deadbolt, is $50 off at $149.30.

    <title>Twitter is the latest social media network to combine shopping and livestreams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pag1wo7jKm8ZJruCqtq5AFxRljE=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178179/pasted_image_0__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s livestream shopping interface.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnU3pZ"&gt;Twitter is hosting its first shopping livestream on November 28th at 7PM ET, the company announced today as it becomes the latest social media platform to embrace the trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkQq3e"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1461640769240854529"&gt;“Cyber Deals Sunday” stream&lt;/a&gt; will be a collaboration with Walmart and will take place during the post-Thanksgiving weekend, which is traditionally associated with big sales promotions. Twitter describes the livestream, which will be hosted by Jason Derulo, as a “30-minute variety show” that will feature “electronics, home goods, apparel, seasonal décor, surprise special guests, and much more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h6jBF"&gt;Twitter joins a growing trend towards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526535/live-shopping-instagram-facebook-amazon-influencers"&gt;shopping-focused livestreams on social media&lt;/a&gt;, providing a modern QVC-style shopping experience with influencers and integrated shopping links. In this month alone, Meta’s Facebook has announced a test of a “&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/shop-with-groups-creators-and-friends/"&gt;Live Shopping for creators&lt;/a&gt;” feature, Pinterest debuted a live shopping series called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22754168/pinterest-tv-live-shopping-experience"&gt;Pinterest TV&lt;/a&gt;,” and YouTube expanded its livestream shopping feature with a week-long shopping event called “&lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-next-generation-live-shopping-experience/"&gt;YouTube Holiday Stream and Shop.&lt;/a&gt;” It’s a trend that’s well and truly taken hold in China, where &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-24/china-s-gen-z-skips-the-stores-and-shops-on-social-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Gen Z consumers are increasingly shifting away from traditional e-commerce retailers towards making purchases via social media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2TwYpXnwNu1VSs3QsZpTYxha_M4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23033954/pasted_image_0__2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The components of the shopping interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZjgnH"&gt;Promotional images show how Twitter’s live shopping interface is split between a video livestream, an online catalog, and a feed of tweets. The stream will continue playing in a picture-in-picture mode if you follow a link to a retailer’s website. Twitter says the shopping elements will only be available on iOS and desktop at first, while Android users will be able to watch the stream but not engage with its shopping capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="utIDvD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8QP9om"&gt;Twitter is characterizing its Walmart stream as a “test” and declined to comment on what form future livestreams might take. However, it did confirm that it only plans for brands to be able to host shopping livestreams for now, and not regular Twitter users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuTMk4"&gt;Twitter’s new livestream shopping feature comes on the heels of a pilot of a new Shop Module it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597576/twitter-shopping-module-pilot-gamestop-arden-cove-brands"&gt;launched in July this year&lt;/a&gt;, which allows select brands to add a shopping section to the top of their profiles. Initially launched with around a dozen brands, Twitter says it’s expanding the feature to more merchants in the US “in the coming weeks.” The platform hasn’t been shy about its attempts to diversify its revenue streams beyond traditional advertising and has also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;premium subscription features&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to make money more directly from its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="monZiA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 22nd, 12:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of the story said the livestream will start at 12PM ET, it will start at 7PM ET on November 28th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is updating its Snapdragon branding to try and simplify its chip names</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRRIycVMvXNE5EBFFqLOL92m2h0=/44x0:644x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178166/eye_688.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm’s teaser for its new branding scheme | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dwFiJC"&gt;Qualcomm has &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2021/11/22/welcome-new-era-snapdragon"&gt;announced some key changes&lt;/a&gt; to how it brands its Snapdragon chips, including a shift away from the three-digit numbering system it’s been using to differentiate between its products for years. The news comes ahead of the company’s expected next-gen flagship chip debut at the Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pWRjX"&gt;To start, Snapdragon will now exist as a standalone brand, separate from the “Qualcomm” brand (which won’t be showing up as much on its chips). It’s a direction the company has started moving in earlier this year (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Snapdragon 888 Plus badge&lt;/a&gt;, for example, notably lacked the word “Qualcomm”), but today’s news solidifies that plan going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4_slc_dklqiNlCeBUSKf8UNpVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034691/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_11.46.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The already “Qualcomm”-less Snapdragon 888 Plus icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HDVufZ"&gt;But the biggest change might be in how the company handles actually naming its semiconductor products. For years, Qualcomm has labeled its chips with three-digit names, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765&lt;/a&gt;, or Snapdragon 888. The first number broadly informed customers how powerful the chip was (with the 8-series chips serving as flagships, while 4-series models were for entry-level products). The second number typically indicated annual generational releases (going from a Snapdragon 865 to an 875), while changes in the third number generally showed more minor updates (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/4/20995714/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-chip-affordable-5g-phones-processor-low-price"&gt;Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/11/21252114/qualcomm-snapdragon-768g-5g-processor-765g-improvements-cpu-gpu-update"&gt;Snapdragon 768G&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0SHGj2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm was running out of numbers to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idLfJk"&gt;The problem, though, is that in addition to being slightly jargony and confusing to keep track of, Qualcomm is also simply running out of numbers in its naming scheme. The 8-series lineup hit Snapdragon 888 last year, the 7-series is already at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350079/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-888-5g-mobile-chipset-phone-android"&gt;Snapdragon 780&lt;/a&gt;, and the 6-series is already on the brink with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740748/qualcomm-snapdragon-695-778-plus-480-680-5g-4g-smartphone-chips"&gt;Snapdragon 695&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyucHw"&gt;Going forward, though, Qualcomm says that it’ll be shifting to “a single-digit series and generation number, aligning with other product categories,” starting with the upcoming announcement of its next 8-series flagship (which had previously been expected to be called the Snapdragon 898, based on Qualcomm’s old pattern). Qualcomm already uses a generational naming scheme for its Snapdragon PC processors, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;Snapdragon 7c Gen 2&lt;/a&gt;, too, so the change isn’t coming out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QPaqkX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lx6qXW9FP18?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YumLEV"&gt;Unfortunately, Qualcomm isn’t actually &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; what that new branding scheme will be, although that announcement is expected to come at the Snapdragon Tech Summit next week. Instead, the company has published a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx6qXW9FP18"&gt;vague hype reel&lt;/a&gt; that features the number eight a lot to tease out the new, top-secret naming scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP3NLL"&gt;In addition to the as-yet-unrevealed naming scheme, Qualcomm also announced a few other details about its Snapdragon branding plan. Going forward, the company plans to emphasize the use of gold to indicate top-tier flagship products. It’s going to stop explicitly calling out 5G on chips, noting that “5G has become ubiquitous” across its product lineup and will be “a given.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart’s hosting a PS5 and Xbox Series X restock for subscribers at 4PM ET</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKdeJ0t8u60hUjSNqb0Apa86cyo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177981/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dEMy8h"&gt;Walmart is kicking off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; with a bang today, offering its Walmart Plus subscribers early access to a big console restock that begins at 4PM ET / 1PM PT. At that time, paid members will have a go at snagging a PlayStation 5 (both the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 disc-based version&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 digital version&lt;/a&gt;) or the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X console&lt;/a&gt;. To get this early access to boost your chances of getting a console (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;it’s no guarantee&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll &lt;strong&gt;need &lt;/strong&gt;to be a paying member to Walmart Plus, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeRestock11222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $12.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;. To reiterate, members sampling the free trial will &lt;strong&gt;not &lt;/strong&gt;get early access to this restock or Walmart’s myriad Black Friday deals that launch an hour earlier at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsbI8F"&gt;Here are the links, with more details about this restock beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmbPiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="iySGYk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wSPUIp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HaYm3"&gt;Hey, if you miss out on a chance to get the Series X, it might save your case during the holidays that the smaller, less-powerful Series S is more readily available and costs less at $299.99. It lacks a disc drive and has half the storage of the Series X (512GB), but it has many of the same features as the high-end console. It targets 1440p resolution for some content, and it can boost certain games up to 120 frames per second, but it could be a great fit for someone who still uses a 1080p TV or monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KCGmrH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0S9oG"&gt;If you say nay to Walmart Plus, the restock will open up to everyone else three hours later at 7PM ET / 4PM PT, though it’s tough to determine how much stock Walmart will have left. Personally, I can’t see the retailer leaving non-subscribers totally high and dry. And with the restock being printed in its Black Friday ad, I expect Walmart to have a surplus of inventory. That said, what’s available will still sell out very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rnSVO"&gt;As for what to expect when the time comes, a Walmart spokesperson shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will “roll out consoles and other hot items in separate windows to help unlock a smooth online shopping experience.” Hopefully, that means the site will be stable during the restock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="matiwg"&gt;In case you don’t know the drill at this point, make sure you’re logged in to your Walmart Plus account, with the correct payment method and shipping address entered in ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2Wbaw3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f58M3f"&gt;Add these to your cart before the restock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zbYawB"&gt;What’s a console without extra games, controllers, or accessories? One that isn’t nearly as fun to use as it should be. Load these items into your Walmart cart ahead of time, so you can get it all at once when the consoles drop. Though, in some cases, you can find better deals at other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s6X9RR"&gt;For PS5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="QgIEC5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HoSimS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ncUxi6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876171"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3WHzie"&gt;For Xbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="3jLbi8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Britain launches review of bias in medical devices</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NLxELX"&gt;Britain’s health secretary announced Sunday that he’s launched a review of racial and gender biases in medical devices, triggered by reports that blood oxygen monitoring devices work less well on people with darker skin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY5NDO"&gt;Secretary Sajid Javid told the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1462393472665673733?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that he thinks it’s possible that some people died during the COVID-19 pandemic because of those discrepancies and that they may have contributed to the overall higher death rates in Black and South Asian people in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CZO4M"&gt;“The possibility that a bias — even an inadvertent one — could lead to a poorer health outcome is totally unacceptable,” Javid wrote &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7Gzyq#selection-895.243-895.361"&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNYtLl"&gt;Research published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2029240"&gt;late 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that pulse oximeters, which usually calculate the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream by sending light through the fingertip, are more likely to miss low levels of oxygen in Black patients than white patients. The finding also caught the attention of United States lawmakers, who &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/senators-warren-booker-and-wyden-urge-fda-to-address-concerns-about-dangerous-pulse-oximeter-inaccuracies-for-patients-of-color"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration to review the devices. The agency put out a warning about its limitations &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/19/fda-issues-alert-on-limitations-of-pulse-oximeters-without-explicit-mention-of-racial-bi/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKJrgQ"&gt;The review will look at bias in all medical devices, not just pulse oximeters, and will evaluate them for gender bias, as well as racial bias. Javid didn’t specifically call out medical algorithms, but those could potentially be included as they’re often regulated as medical devices in the US and UK. Over the past few years, expert analysis of algorithms showed that they’re often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22770852/data-dermatology-algorithms-skin-tone-ethnicity"&gt;built&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455946/medical-algorithm-ai-geography-research-accuracy"&gt;in ways&lt;/a&gt; that reproduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995178/racial-bias-health-care-algorithms-cory-booker-senator-wyden"&gt;racial bias.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhn12V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7Gzyq#selection-809.89-809.111"&gt;Javid said&lt;/a&gt; he’d been discussing the issue with US Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and hopes to work with the US and other nations on international standards for medical devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK-based EV retrofitter company looks to grow in the US market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Ford GT40 in profile-rear view on a concrete track" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZGhO-jiQ7xb8XQgUVxrwk7uXUs=/0x0:6283x4189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177853/02_Everrati.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0INxmz"&gt;Justin Lunny, CEO of the UK-based electric vehicle conversion company Everrati, sees his work as more than just taking on iconic vehicles, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/16/11006458/zelectric-vw-beetle-electric-1959-volkswagen-microbus-video"&gt;VW Microbus&lt;/a&gt;, and giving them an electric powertrain. “Our ethos is about redefining the cars,” Lunny said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We redefine them as an EV.” After two years in operation, Lunny is finally bringing that ethos to the US in the hopes of tapping into a growing EV conversion market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4Mw0X"&gt;No structure is damaged during the process of converting the cars: “To the untrained eye, they look like a beautiful, original Porsche or GT40 or Land Rover... true to the essence of the original, but without any emissions anymore,” Lunny shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6QGGw"&gt;All conversions are also reversible to retain value. For example, a converted 1991 Porsche can be unbolted and retuned back to its original state. Still, Lunny doesn’t anticipate any customers ever reversing their vehicles back to running gas, but the fact that they can do it was important. “No one will ever do it, but it’s a good thing to show,” Lunny said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBX6lq"&gt;Lunny has a background in building financial-technology companies, selling one of them in 2017. “My passions, however, are cars alongside tech,” he said. To that end, Everrati is mostly a self-funded operation, but it does include some investors. According to Lunny, Everrati is seeing 45 percent of customer interest coming from the US, a place where the company was not initially promoting itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVaJr0"&gt;The first US orders are coming from high-income areas in California and Florida, in addition to New York and Long Island. All of Everrati’s customers are wealthy tech and auto enthusiasts, with the first customer in the US being a “tech billionaire,” according to Lunny, who won’t share the customer’s identity. He describes Everrati’s main customers more eloquently: “High net-worth, sort of thought leaders, really; they believe in sustainability, but they got style,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u7401F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whilst I am not going to be the next Elon Musk, I have an idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e60T1G"&gt;“If you look at the Prius generation and the early Tesla generation... I generally see it [like] this kind of feel for what we are doing now,” Lunny explained. Tesla started off with selling the original Roadster to wealthy individuals first and then used that to make more affordable cars. Lunny sees a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/20/12242162/tesla-elon-musk-master-plan-solarcity-autonomous"&gt;similar path&lt;/a&gt; for Everrati as it looks to its next round of funding the US: “Whilst I am not going to be the next Elon Musk, I have an idea that... these beautiful cars should be allowed to continue being driven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEc8zd"&gt;Everrati is a small firm but growing. The company currently stands at 19 employees, two of which were hired in recent weeks. To achieve “OEM high-quality standards” of engineering, Everrati hired several engineers from top manufacturers, including Lotus, McClaren, and a business partner from Mercedes-Benz. It also recently poached Amit Chandarana, vice president and head of commercial for Gettacar, an online used car retailer, to serve as a senior advisor for the US-based operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOM8K5"&gt;Everrati chooses specific cars and starts with the conversion work. When all the engineering and tooling are complete, the newly electric cars become available to order in the online configurator as a “customizable project.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PKI5Qm"&gt;If a customer wanted a Porsche 964, they can either bring their own, or Everrati will go find one and then convert it using the process it already built. But it can take time to complete a single project. For example, the process of converting a Land Rover, from development to final product, took 18 months. Everything works as expected, including the speedometer and shifters, which all behave exactly as they would if it were still a gas car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ehf96w"&gt;“If 15 people want a Land Rover, for example, we know that we can build them to the same standard each time, as opposed to 20 different cars coming at different points,” Lunny said. “We kind of production-ize the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7l643g"&gt;Lunny defended the deliberative approach taken by Everrati as what makes the company distinct from the competition. “Dare I say, we are unique in that,” he said. “A lot of other companies will take your car in one day; three months later, you have it back. There’s no — dare I say — testing, security standards... a very different market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5fI6q"&gt;Electric vehicle conversions of old gas cars seems to be a small but fast-growing market. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.zelectricmotors.com"&gt;Zelectric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://evwest.com/catalog/"&gt;EV West&lt;/a&gt; are already established in the US and have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20747528/electric-porsche-912-vintage-restoration-tesla-car-vehicle-ev"&gt;converting vehicles for years&lt;/a&gt;. Zelectric, in particular, originally started by stuffing Tesla donor parts into classic cars. Even big manufacturers like Ford are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759825/ford-electric-crate-motors-mustang-mach-e-gt-performance"&gt;getting into the game&lt;/a&gt; by reselling Mustang Mach-E motors as drop-in crate motors. Lunny mentions that Ford’s motors are probably good for large American muscle-sized vehicles but does not see Everrati ever using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AFK22"&gt;Lunny said the cars that they work on are very iconic and beautiful but acknowledges that they are bad for the environment. “These cars emit their own body weight in CO2 every couple thousand miles,” he said. “As we are moving to clean energy and clean air... lot of people won’t be comfortable with it, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNin4m"&gt;The starting price of an Everrati converted vehicle is around $200,000, but most cars go for about $500,000. It’s going to go even higher because some customers are bringing in their own classic cars, some of which retail for over $1 million. The long-term goal is to be a real business; Lunny wants Everrati to become an iconic EV brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RT217l"&gt;“We start with the high end. The key thing is going to be about quality — it’s about luxury, it’s about beautifully finished almost Concord-standard cars,” he said, “and that’s the first period of time, and of course, then as when we grow that market share we can look to do, possibly, a wider addressable market as the technology and the cost allows us to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Red classic Porsche 911 964 driving on street" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wl02Jtvv4sI-mXuqECBn6x7ldG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028128/03_Everrati.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everrati’s electric Porsche 911 (964) Coupe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t3Dn2b"&gt;The highest expense for the company is the batteries. Lunny shared that they have a partner company that builds packs based on Everrati’s design and specifications, with cells coming mostly from Chinese battery company Envision and some from LG. Everrati’s building 700-volt, 60kWh battery packs with liquid cooling, which can DC fast charge at up to 80kW via CCS Combo. Charging can take 45 minutes to go from 20 percent to 85 percent, Lunny said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Hk116"&gt;The GT40 is Everrati’s “home-grown EV supercar” with partner Superformance and the key next step into the US market. “Our next funding round is to solidify our leadership in the UK, we’ve got some real interest in the UK... and have a production base in California” and will be available to order early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ss0yMc"&gt;But there are cars that even Everrati won’t touch. Like a Porsche 959 with only 700 miles on the speedometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QvqKW"&gt;“We politely declined,” Lunny said of the customer who requested the conversion, “because we don’t believe that’s the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
