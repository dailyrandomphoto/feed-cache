    <title>Android 12 is now available for Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEtPXJ"&gt;The final version of Android 12 has been available to developers and eager fans for a few weeks on AOSP, but today, it officially launched for people who want to easily pick up the update over the air. It’s available to install right now on Pixel 3 and up, including the Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, the Pixel 5, and the Pixel 5A. It’ll launch on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495075"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, as well. Android 12 will be coming later this year to Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKAdZA"&gt;The most noticeable feature in Android 12 is the new Material You design, which lets you go a little deeper to tweak the look of the homescreen to your liking. It’s more expressive than previous versions of Android, with tools to let you coordinate colors that can extend across app icons, pull-down menus, widgets, and more. Speaking of widgets, many of those have been updated to match the new look, and Google shared today that by the end of October, it plans to have over a dozen new or refreshed widgets available for its first-party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at some of the new widgets made for Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uk9I0L"&gt;There are plenty of other features in Android 12, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;you can read more about them in my review of the software&lt;/a&gt;. Google also &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-12/"&gt;published a blog&lt;/a&gt; that goes deep on the features you’ll be able to experience. But if you’re mainly interested in Material You, you should know that Google says it’s a “Pixel-first” feature, though it will be coming to “more device makers and phones soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EghAY"&gt;It’s likely that Pixel phones will receive several more “Pixel-first” features in the future with Android 12. For the past couple of years, Google has released feature drops that make it a little sweeter to be a Pixel user. Some of the features only work on newer Pixel phones, though, so that’s all the more reason to consider picking up the new Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro. Google shared during its hardware event that these phones will get a minimum of five years of support, which is impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRFxm0"&gt;To get the update, head to your Pixel phone’s settings app, click “System,” then find “System update” and click into it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro finally bring new camera hardware in addition to software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VtgRIH-mWfqkyKBFGA8viHnuWSQ=/0x1364:4500x4364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016201/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear bar of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro house new cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpOfKf"&gt;Today at its Pixel Fall Launch event, after many pre-announcements and leaks, Google finally announced all the details of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Some of the biggest changes to these new flagship phones from Google are updated camera modules. Pixel phones were long the champions of smartphone photography, but Google has been resting on its laurels for a while, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496686/pixel-5-camera-comparison-sensor-specs-features"&gt;using the same 12.2-megapixel Sony IMX363 sensor&lt;/a&gt; from Pixel 3 through Pixels 5 and 5A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sb47Nq"&gt;Now, the main cameras of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro house a 50-megapixel sensor that is larger than its predecessors and bins the images down to a 12.5-megapixel output. Google claims it can capture 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5. Following the iPhone playbook, both Pixels feature ultrawide lenses with 12-megapixel sensors while the 6 Pro adds a third, telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom coupled to 48 megapixels of resolution. On the front, the Pixel 6’s selfie cam is 8 megapixels with an 84-degree field of view, while the 6 Pro is 11.1 megapixels and 94 degrees for easier group selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzfLbX"&gt;The rear camera setup is quite the departure from prior Pixels, where the commodity hardware of Pixel cameras allowed Google to focus squarely on software optimization. Some Pixel iterations added or removed an extra lens or two, but each relied mostly on computational features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYtdsp"&gt;Those software developments have brought new features to the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro as well. Google claims its reengineered Portrait Mode can better render different skin tones of wider, more diverse groups of people, naming the feature Real Tone. Google coordinated with photographers and cinematographers of color to build more diverse portraits into the image dataset of its camera models. Google says it went to the lengths of even correcting some aberrations that affect the image rendering of those with darker skin more harshly, such as implementing a new algorithm to decrease stray light, which washes out dark skin. Google says it is dedicated to building a more equitable experience across its camera and imaging products, which will hopefully be a welcome departure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai"&gt;past omissions in its algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDB55D"&gt;What Google calls Face Unblur promises to use the multiple images recorded with each shutter press to keep faces sharp, even when photographing movement. Motion Mode is designed for capturing action shots and long exposure, for aesthetics like streaking car lights across a nightscape or panning with a moving subject to blur the background and give a sense of speed. Lastly, Magic Eraser will attempt to remove distracting objects and photo bombers in Google Photos. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VR8CgFsIs7CEXGf7-1i2o5yuFX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938901/Magic_Eraser.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic Eraser can automatically remove unwanted subjects from backgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hVmodH"&gt;Magic Eraser sounds a bit like the long-abandoned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654476/google-photos-object-removal-feature-demo"&gt;chain-link fence concept&lt;/a&gt;, now resurrected in a more achievable form. Google showed off automatic object removal at Google I/O 2017, six months before the Pixel 2 came out, but it never made it to a device. It was seemingly forgotten and quietly left behind by Google. Though it has since been a case study for Google’s software-first mentality, it looks like a version of it is alive now in the Pixel 6 and Google Photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrZ97Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22497573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel Pass bundles Google’s phone and services into one monthly subscription  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XaSjs1WlGYRyubb65GyyzrMp6hM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016173/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="diXM3S"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/?_ga=2.14465783.1972768495.1634663243-1405963905.1634663243"&gt;Pixel Pass&lt;/a&gt; is a new subscription bundle designed to let US customers pay for a Pixel phone in monthly installments while also getting access to Google’s premium subscription services like 200GB of Google One cloud storage, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music Premium, and Google Play Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43CY8A"&gt;Prices start at $45 a month for Pixel 6 or $55 for a Pixel 6 Pro, and Google says they’re available unlocked and should work with all major carriers. Pixel Pass subscribers are eligible for an upgrade after two years, Google says, and the subscription also includes an extra year of warranty coverage over the standard one-year manufacturer warranty (aka &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518?hl=en-GB"&gt;Preferred Care&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ESzROO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting at $45 a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="19uNXU"&gt;Pixel Pass, which is being announced today alongside the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495075"&gt;new Pixel 6 phones&lt;/a&gt;, appears to combine elements of Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program (which lets customers pay for an iPhone via monthly payments and offers an extended warranty), as well as its separate Apple One services bundle. Apple One currently includes subscriptions to Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, Apple Fitness Plus, and iCloud. However, a key difference is that Pixel Pass only offers an upgrade after two years, while Apple offers an upgrade after just one to users on its upgrade program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuPmHu"&gt;Google says if subscribers cancel before the two years are up, they’ll have to pay off the remaining value of the Pixel device early at its regular “non-discounted price” and will also lose access to the bundled services. Upgrading your device at the end of the two-year period may change the price you’re paying, the company cautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ3P31"&gt;Google says its Pixel Pass subscription is available via Google Fi, as well as the Google Store. Google Fi subscribers can save an additional $5 off their monthly Fi plan with a Pixel Pass subscription. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can preorder Google’s just-announced Pixels.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are freshly announced, and they’re already up for preorder. The new Pixels promise to offer the latest from Google, including new designs, new cameras, a new and uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two flavors: the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro. The base Pixel 6 with 128GB of storage starts at a price of $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google has already kicked off its preorders on its own store&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers and carriers are coming online shortly. We will update this post as more options become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have big screens, big ambitions, and small prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5De6cYg1oD4_rn2GWs6Lgp7kRxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016178/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 Pro (left) and Pixel 6&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google claims to finally be ready to take on Apple and Samsung&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TCOahY"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729135/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-photos-images-renders-evan-blass"&gt;many leaks&lt;/a&gt;, official teases, and months of waiting, Google has finally given its latest Pixel phones a formal launch. The new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are the latest high-end phones from the company that hasn’t traditionally been able to make much of a dent in the high-end phone market. Both are available for preorder starting today, October 19th, and will begin shipping on October 28th. Google says all the major US carriers, plus retailers such as the Google Store, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and others, will be selling the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIFGEC"&gt;There are a lot of things to cover with the new Pixels, but the most important place to start is this: $599 and $899. Those are the starting prices for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, respectively. That pricing is aggressive compared to similar iPhones, Samsungs, or even OnePlus phones, especially when you consider that Google is providing 128GB of storage in both base models. (The 6 can be equipped with up to 256GB, the 6 Pro has options up to 512GB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTmvm"&gt;Aggressive pricing has long been a Pixel &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, and though the new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro represent a new push from Google to make phones that are competitive with the best from Apple and Samsung, these prices are just lower than the competition. A big draw for a lot of people might be that, at the end of the day, the Pixels just cost less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUbJxf38TEYXXa1KB0-HKkD7i6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934843/cwelch_211015_4802_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Pixel 6 Pro (left) and the Pixel 6 are large phones — Google isn’t offering small and large options this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfOfNy"&gt;The other big thing to note with the Pixels is their new processor, a custom-designed ARM SoC (System on a Chip) that Google is calling Tensor. Google says it’s competitive with the Snapdragon 888 from Qualcomm, which is what you find in basically every other high-end Android phone available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHplBf"&gt;There’s a lot going on with this processor. The most important piece is that there’s a custom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI built right into the chip and many main processing pipelines. In addition, there are two high-power application cores, two mid-range cores, four low-power cores, a dedicated coprocessor for security, a private compute core, and an image processing core. The Pixel 6 pairs the new chip with 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro has 12GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjG5Ci"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a lot going on with Google’s new Tensor processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXG8bQ"&gt;Visually, the new phones are a departure from prior Pixel phones. Though they share a common design language, that language doesn’t really connect back to the Pixel 5 or the Pixel 4 that came before. Instead, these are flashier, shinier phones, with polished metal frames (on the 6 Pro) and glossy glass backs (on both). Google is offering each phone in three different colors, but the 6 Pro’s are decidedly more “professional” (read: boring), while the regular Pixel 6 colors are clearly more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5bLu7"&gt;I haven’t really been able to put a finger on how I feel about the new designs, but there’s something undeniably generic about them. Take the G logo off the back, and these could be phones from Samsung, TCL, OnePlus, Oppo, or any one of a number of other Chinese OEMs. Prior Pixel phones often were criticized for having a plain look that bordered on reference designs, but they all had a Google-y aesthetic to them. I’m not sure these new models have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmRQgK"&gt;By the way, Google’s rules for reviewers and influencers dictate that today, we can write about hardware impressions and specs but not provide any details on software, performance, or image quality. It’s meant to provide a sort of hands-on experience — rest assured, we will have much more to say in the full review.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera module is the most prominent part of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a new standard wide camera and new ultra wide camera in both phones; the Pixel 6 Pro adds a 4x telephoto camera to the mix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbtPK1"&gt;The most prominent feature on the 6 and 6 Pro is the back camera housing. I call it a ledge; you might call it a shelf; Google seems to refer to it as a “bar,” but it’s an enormous protuberance that spans the entire width of the phone and houses two (Pixel 6) or three (6 Pro) cameras and related sensors in it. The bar is large, but unlike camera housings located in the upper corner, like you get on an iPhone or Samsung, it doesn’t cause the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro to rock when placed down. A case will likely help mitigate the size, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPMn1T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A camera upgrade years in the making&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIDafJ"&gt;That back camera housing is so prominent because, as usual with Pixel phones, the camera is one of the most important parts of these new models. Google has finally switched to a new camera sensor after using the prior one for four straight generations. Both phones have a 50-megapixel main sensor that is hard coded to output 12.5-megapixel images. It’s a much larger sensor than Google’s used before — physically larger than even the iPhone 13 Pro’s new camera sensor — comes with 1.2μm pixels, and is behind an f/1.85 aperture optically stabilized lens. Google says it captures 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5’s camera. Next to it is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with a 114-degree field of view, f/2.2 lens and similarly large 1.25μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsVTtt"&gt;If you spring for the Pixel 6 Pro, you also get a 4x telephoto camera that’s not available on the standard Pixel 6. This uses folded optics, has 48-megapixels (also binned down to 12-megapixel output), and has an f/3.5 aperture lens. 4x is slightly longer reach than you get with the iPhone 13 Pro’s 3x tele but not nearly as far as the 10x lens that Samsung has been putting on its high-end phones (not to mention the even longer lenses companies like Xiaomi and Huawei have deployed recently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnlCY"&gt;The front cameras differ between the models, too, with the Pixel 6 getting an 8-megapixel, 84-degree field of view and the 6 Pro using an 11.1-megapixel, 94-degree camera. That translates into you’ll be able to fit more people in a selfie with the 6 Pro than you can with the 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awL99E"&gt;The new processor enables some new image editing features, like a “magic eraser” tool that gets rid of distracting elements in your images automatically and new long-exposure and motion blur capture modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX8iLW"&gt;For video, both phones can shoot up to 4K 60fps, now complete with Google’s auto HDR image processing, or capture up to 240fps slow-mo video at 1080p. While Google has generally excelled at still image capture, it has long been behind Apple in video capture — we’ll be seeing just how far it’s come and if it’s more competitive now when we review the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHl6jRq1h1U8Rsi2ktVZD-U71Kc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934844/cwelch_211015_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 90Hz, 1080p, 6.4-inch OLED screen (left); the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch, 120Hz, 1440p OLED with LTPO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqvN2U"&gt;Turning to the front of the devices, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have large, OLED displays. The 6’s screen measures 6.4 inches diagonally, has 1080p wide resolution, and can refresh at 90Hz for a smoother scrolling experience. It’s a flat panel and has slightly larger bezels all around than the 6 Pro, which utilizes curved sides on its 6.7-inch, 1440p screen to minimize the bezels. The 6 Pro also uses LTPO technology to vary its refresh rate from as low a 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz, depending on what you’re doing on the phone. Both phones’ displays are covered in the latest Gorilla Glass Victus glass and support HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPEjNj"&gt;The screens are bright and look good, though if you turn them off-axis, you can see noticeable color shift, and there’s a visible shadow in the 6 Pro’s curves. Those are things we don’t see in the best screens from Apple and Samsung at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1YAfnl3T0GOFnK8ksZlW-HFD40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936585/cwelch_211015_4802_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve on the Pixel 6 Pro produces a noticeable shadow on light backgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JDXcqe"&gt;As you can probably guess from those screen sizes, both of these phones are big. Unlike prior years where Google provided a small and a big option, there’s no real small phone in this lineup. In fact, the Pixel 6 is effectively as big as an iPhone 13 Pro Max; the 6 Pro is even larger, though its curves help mask its large footprint somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCEWce"&gt;Between the two, the 6 Pro certainly feels more “premium.” Its aluminum sides are thinner and polished to a shine; the regular 6 has thicker, matte sides. And there are more rough edges to find: there’s a different radius curve for the camera bar than the rest of the phone and inconsistencies with the clickiness of the buttons in the units we’ve been able to handle so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jsbNa6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There aren’t any major feature omissions this time around — a rarity for Pixel phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Wk2c"&gt;Rounding out the hardware features are the things you’d expect to find on a premium phone in late 2021. Both have wireless charging (and reverse wireless charging for accessories), IP68 weather resistance ratings, in-screen optical fingerprint sensors, stereo speakers, and fast charging support. But you won’t get a charger in the box — you’ll have to either buy a 30W brick separately or use something you already have to take advantage of that last feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZfnWZ"&gt;Both phones also support 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, though only the 6 Pro and a special version of the 6 for Verizon (which costs $100 more) have millimeter wave support. Batteries are large in both models, as well: 4614mAh in the 6 and 5004mAh in the 6 Pro. We won’t know for sure until we’re able to fully review them, but the concerns of Pixel phones coming with underequipped batteries seem to be fully in the past at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m07WNB"&gt;Lastly, the Pixel 6 Pro also has an ultrawideband chip, similar to recent iPhone and Galaxy models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro color options are a bit boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MBIkzqa8G4XMu3yO_gP0NDAn7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934836/bfarsace_211014_4802_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s more fun in the regular Pixel 6 color options (a basic black and grey one is also available).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0L0coA"&gt;As you’d expect from a Pixel, the new models ship with the latest version of Android — in this case, Android 12. We’ve already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;gone in depth on Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro add a few new features that leverage their custom processors, such as faster on-device translation and those new AI-powered image editing features mentioned above. Importantly, Google says the new phones will get a minimum of five years of software support, longer than any other Pixel before and longer than virtually any other Android phone you can buy now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GCCDXt"&gt;Google really wants us to know that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are a turning point for the company. In an interview ahead of the announcement, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said “this is truly the starting line for Pixel, in that, we’ve brought together all the elements that we think we need to be a real player in this space.” We can’t tell yet whether Google will finally be a “real player” in the smartphone world with its Pixel phones, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro do look like its best effort yet. Stay tuned for our full review in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro launch event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3YgsF1z4R1qUrFipuIgnquXaxGU=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016057/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The biggest Pixel in years — literally&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="8lbYBY"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;pre-annoucements&lt;/a&gt;, ads and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732322/pixel-6-pro-price-leak-us-eu"&gt;more leaks&lt;/a&gt;, the time has come for Google to officially launch the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. We already know many details: the custom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; that powers it, the colors and many of the specs, and even some of the software features have all been officially announced. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;rumors have filled in more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Wplu"&gt;But there will be more to hear from Google. This is easily the most important Pixel the company has launched in years, it’s a launch where the company says it is taking on flagships from Apple and Samsung at the high end. Google hasn’t really talked big game about its phones before, so even if we’ve seen a lot of rumors, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Google goes about making this launch happen will be interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKj7Ak"&gt;We’ll likely get a deeper dive into the specs on these phones, including whether the new camera system really is good enough to justify the massive camera ledge on the backs of these phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdCxGr"&gt;We’ll be live blogging the event alongside our other extensive coverage of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, so watch along as we watch Google finally try to step up to the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s new Video Doorbell Pro costs $65 and promises six months of battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvEcmvSCQo3EtucvoqgBZfJsovI=/0x0:3954x2636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015985/04.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze’s Video Doorbell Pro promises up to 6 months of battery life&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtUhsg"&gt;Smart home company Wyze has revealed its latest category-breaking device, and this time, it’s going straight for Ring’s lunch with an impressive-sounding video doorbell that checks pretty much all the right boxes. Except maybe the “cool style and nice design” one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2SKTF"&gt;Available for preorders on October 19th and shipping in December, the &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-video-doorbell-pro.html"&gt;Wyze Video Doorbell Pro costs $65&lt;/a&gt; (plus shipping), can be installed fully wired or wire-free, has up to six months of battery life, and a 1:1 aspect ratio that can take in your entire front porch. It records and streams video in 1440 x 1440 HD and offers 12-second clip playback for motion and sound events for free. The recordings are stored in Wyze’s cloud; there is no local storage option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JHPoA"&gt;The doorbell comes with a Wyze wireless Chime, which offers 20 different ringtones. In addition, the Doorbell Pro will work on 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi. If you want smart notifications — like person, animal, or package detection — you will need to sign up for Wyze’s Cam Plus service (which starts from $1.49 a month). This also adds unlimited video length recording and takes away the 5-minute cool-down period (during which time the camera won’t record after it finished the last recording).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilYS_fWLeYEBpV-CjG_Ocm7VA8g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938885/01.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wyze’s new doorbell comes with a wireless plug-in chime so you can hear your doorbell ring inside your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K5KwtA"&gt;The downside here is that because the battery is built in, you will have to take it down to charge it (via a USB cable). But if you are able to hard-wire it, with 16- to 24-volt wiring, the doorbell will work off wired power, rather than just trickle-charging from the battery. This adds the ability to capture an extra 3-6 seconds of pre-roll video before an event, meaning you’re less likely to miss a visitor who buzzes and runs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfJteL"&gt;Also, Wyze told me that the doorbell won’t work with existing electronic doorbell chimes; you have to use the included wireless one. And the company says certifications for Alexa and Google Assistant compatibility are under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb20Bz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-doorbell.html"&gt;Wyze’s current video doorbell &lt;/a&gt;costs $50 (plus shipping) and offers 1080p HD video with a 3:4 aspect ratio. It is hard-wired only and doesn’t support 5GHz Wi-Fi. The closest Ring comparison is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252181/ring-video-doorbell-new-wired-size-features-price"&gt;Ring Video Doorbell Wired&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $79.99 with a wireless Chime included but doesn’t have the option of battery power. For a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249028/ring-video-doorbell-specs-price-date"&gt;battery-powered Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the next option is $100 without the Chime — but Ring’s doorbells will work with an existing mechanical chime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHrJvk"&gt;However, Wyze hasn’t managed to be the cheapest in the market this time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698612/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-outdoor-camera-floodlight-solar-panel"&gt;Blink announced a $50 wired and battery-powered doorbell&lt;/a&gt; last month that can run for up to two years on two AA lithium batteries. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new MacBook Pros have one big question mark: battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gqh_ToGRXYPcvFG0NBU8EADjT9o=/240x0:2640x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015925/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_8.43.20_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JmfhOe"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;are here&lt;/a&gt;, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;may actually live up to the “Pro” moniker&lt;/a&gt;. But there’s one big question that comes with the new sizes and processors: how’s the battery life? To hear Apple tell it, it’s going to be great — the company even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/exM1uajp--A?t=2638"&gt;said onstage&lt;/a&gt; that the 16-inch had the best battery life ever, besting last year’s M1 Macs (which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558095/apple-silicon-m1-chip-arm-macs-soc-charge-power-efficiency-mobile-processor"&gt;also boasted would have the longest-lived batteries&lt;/a&gt;). But the metric Apple used to back up that claim is a bit suspect, and its other numbers tell a very different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEPp25"&gt;In its keynote and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Apple says the 14-inch MacBook Pro will provide 17 hours of video playback and estimates that the 16-inch model can last for an unprecedented-for-Macs 21 hours. But using video playback as a measure of battery life is really only useful if you’re trying to sell a particular narrative — not if you just want to let people know how long their laptops will actually last. For one, Apple says these figures are derived from watching a movie using the Apple TV app. That’s not generally what people use their laptops for unless they’re marathoning the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; extended cuts. Plus, modern CPUs have so much silicon dedicated to video playback that it’s almost become effortless for them. It’s a battery flex, not a battery test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V4vz8j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In a more realistic test, the 14-inch MacBook Pro doesn’t beat the Air — those numbers didn’t make it onstage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvAbe0"&gt;That point is backed up by the fact that Apple’s more realistic wireless web test tells a very different story. Apple says the test involves browsing 25 popular websites using Wi-Fi, with screen brightness set to “8 clicks from bottom.” Under these conditions, the 16-inch MacBook Pro fails to beat even the M1 MacBook Air — it only gets 14 hours of life compared to the Air’s 15 hours. Apple’s estimate for the new 14-inch is 11 hours, the same as the 2020 &lt;em&gt;Intel&lt;/em&gt; MacBook Air. Even this unflattering test (for the new MacBooks, not the old ones) has limitations: last we heard, Apple runs it using its own Safari browser instead of the more popular (and, according to macOS’s Activity Monitor, more energy-hungry) Chrome. Plus, some websites will drain your battery much faster than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKkaaD"&gt;In terms of hard numbers, the 14-inch MacBook Pro has a 70 watt-hour battery, and the 16-inch takes it all the way up to &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/more_info/?hazmat=7"&gt;the FAA limit&lt;/a&gt; of 100Wh (the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro has a 58.2 Wh battery, for comparison). Again, though, these metrics only tell us so much. The 16-inch Intel-based MacBook also had a 100Wh battery, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;only provided around eight hours of usage&lt;/a&gt;, despite Apple’s quoted 11-hour battery life. Plus, Apple is quoting three hours &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; battery life for the 14-inch than the 13-inch, despite the new laptop having a bigger battery. Yes, that number’s not based on a great metric, but that’s also not necessarily a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0fVMvkIsOc2hZlL52jl2DPTszI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22937340/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_4.33.22_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple quotes less runtime for the 14-inch MBP than the 13-inch one, despite the roughly 20 percent bigger battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NXKL80"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558095/apple-silicon-m1-chip-arm-macs-soc-charge-power-efficiency-mobile-processor"&gt;pulled this same trick last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it almost didn’t matter — the ARM processors lasted so much longer than Intel’s that we were willing to let it slide that the MacBook Air probably wouldn’t actually reach Apple’s estimated 18 hours of battery life. This year, Apple is setting even higher expectations for battery life, even though the new laptops are supposed to be significantly more powerful. It just seems unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZJKwE"&gt;The MacBook Pro 14- and 16-inch have to feed more power-hungry (in relative terms, at least) performance cores, and they have fewer efficient cores to make use of when you’re doing light work like checking email or browsing a website or two. The standard M1 has four performance and four efficiency cores, where the M1 Pro and Max only have two efficiency cores, having traded in the rest for more performance ones: the cut-down eight-core M1 Pro that comes with the base 14-inch laptop has six performance cores, while the 10-core full M1 Pro and M1 Max have eight performance cores. They also have more powerful GPUs — the old M1 has 7 or 8 GPU cores; the new versions are rocking 14 to 32. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sZcZYF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Different numbers of CPU and GPU cores could also affect battery life&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hoc6ao"&gt;On top of that, the 14- and 16-inch laptops have what Apple calls an “advanced thermal architecture,” which includes an extra fan. Will that make a big impact? Will Apple be able to beat the original M1’s extra efficiency cores using sheer battery size? We simply won’t know until we can test these laptops in the real world — stay tuned for that in our upcoming reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbmERv"&gt;Great battery life has been the biggest story of Apple’s M1 laptops up until this point, with many people describing the Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro’s battery life as “all day.” It’s understandable why Apple would want to keep riding that goodwill and say that it’s done that again — and while it may have, the company hasn’t proven it yet, not with what it’s presented. So, if you want to be sure you’re getting the MacBook with the best battery life, you may want to hold off for a bit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724608/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-macbook-pro-how-to-buy-price-availability-release-date"&gt;on pre-ordering the new ones&lt;/a&gt; — at least for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When WhatsApp went down, Brazilian workers’ jobs went with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p0U18BV7v52gTeRslv49aqZzzBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015891/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Facebook outage shut down an entire economy of informal work&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="f3Qm7F"&gt;The day before a job, Luiza Ferreira always messages her client on WhatsApp to confirm they need her services. Ferreira is a cleaner in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and she cleans different households every day. If the job is confirmed, she knows she won’t be wasting money on her commute and guarantees income for that day. If the job is not confirmed, she tries to fit another client in her schedule so she doesn’t lose money for the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0zth4"&gt;But on October 4th, that system fell apart. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;A configuration change in Facebook’s internal network&lt;/a&gt; wiped the company’s services off the internet for six hours — including WhatsApp. Cut off from Brazil’s primary mode of communication, Ferreira’s business ground to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZscmXP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s income I can’t really get back”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aEe5ZL"&gt;“By the time I started using SMS instead of WhatsApp, it was too late and I couldn’t book another client for the next day instead,” Ferreira told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview through WhatsApp audio notes. “My client didn’t see the text message I sent her. When WhatsApp was down, it really disrupted my life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj9rk3"&gt;The outage lasted for six hours, but it cost Ferriera two whole days’ worth of earnings, since she also couldn’t schedule work for the following day. “That’s income I can’t really get back,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdL2hh"&gt;Facebook and WhatsApp are &lt;a href="https://mediarxiv.org/k2hjv/"&gt;the most popular online platforms&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil, spanning regional and social divides. Fifty-nine percent of the population has a Facebook account and 66 percent use WhatsApp, turning the services into a kind of essential infrastructure for the country. Professor Rafael Grohmann, coordinator of the DigiLabour Research Lab and a collaborator of the project Fairwork at University of Oxford, attributes Brazilians’ use of WhatsApp instead of text messaging or email to several factors. Brazil lacks telecom infrastructure and competitive market share that makes communications service affordable, and the free app allows Brazilian users to bypass expensive messaging services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="au4egv"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “Loads of clients were calling a single phone number”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oU6BRJ"&gt;“During the pandemic, [WhatsApp] became the place where everything is done,” Grohmann says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNatze"&gt;The app has become particularly vital for informal workers, who depend on the free service to manage their work schedules, charge clients, and sell products. So when both platforms went down, the livelihoods of Ferreira and millions of other informal workers went down with them. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, &lt;a href="https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2021-07/taxa-de-informalidade-no-mercado-de-trabalho-sobe-para-40-diz-ibge"&gt;34.7 million people in Brazil work in the informal economy of the country&lt;/a&gt;, without the safety net of formal employment and benefits. During the pandemic, the number of informal workers has grown by 40 percent due to the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/brazils-economic-crisis-prolonged-by-covid-19-poses-an-enormous-challenge-to-the-amazon-157556"&gt;worsening economic crisis&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvDVrS"&gt;There are competing services for arranging informal work — most notably Uber and Rappi — but they all charge a percentage of the workers’ pay. As a result, workers often actively move their clients onto WhatsApp to avoid losing a cut of their earnings. “It’s common for cleaners to tell their clients, this platform gets 15 to 20 percent of my pay, I’ll give you a cheaper price if you schedule through WhatsApp and pay me through bank transfer,” Grohmann said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPmu50"&gt;During the outage, Bruno Torres, an online salesman for children’s clothes, estimated he lost around R$3,000 (US$500). “We needed to post our new merchandise and speak to our clients who were asking if we had any new clothes,” Torres said. “Loads of clients were calling a single phone number.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="KCWmAd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We really depend on this service to be able to work in our day to day life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zaZzfk"&gt;For Torres, WhatsApp is a free tool of communication that allows him to speak to several clients at the same time, thus maximizing his profit. “Without WhatsApp, there would be a decline in my sales,” Torres said. “And it would also impact my psychological wellbeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3HGty"&gt;WhatsApp commerce also extends to one-off sales of homemade goods and a wide range of less easily classifiable work. In &lt;a href="https://cetic.br/media/docs/publicacoes/2/20201104182616/painel_tic_covid19_3edicao_livro%20eletr%C3%B4nico.pdf"&gt;a research paper about the effects of the pandemic on work&lt;/a&gt;, the Information and Communication Nucleus of the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (NIC) found that 30 percent of internet users who worked during the pandemic sold products or services over messaging apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu1qH3"&gt;“People find ways to sell their wares, in Brazil we call this &lt;em&gt;viração&lt;/em&gt;, when you manage to survive by selling things, be that cakes or clothes, whatever,” Grohmann explained. “This is a way for the working class to survive and they start to depend more and more on WhatsApp for that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jod4lQ"&gt;Grohmann says even securely employed workers use the app to communicate during the workday, and that the audio feature is particularly helpful for informal workers who cannot read or write well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVdIHT"&gt;“Brazil has a very high illiteracy rate, so audio notes are very useful,” Grohmann explained. “We also have a very oral culture. So the use of audio notes for Brazilians is really important and it intersects with the culture of informal work and who does that work. I know people who send me voice notes saying ‘OK’ rather than writing it down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19Ub4f"&gt;Grohmann says that WhatsApp has also &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/7/1/brazil-deliverymen-for-uber-other-apps-protest-amid-pandemic"&gt;allowed workers to organize against precarity&lt;/a&gt;, showing how the use of privatized modes of communications can be negotiated and used to the advantage of the workers. “Delivery app workers in Brazil started organizing through WhatsApp, in group chats [designed for organizing strikes],” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H59vri"&gt;Once the disruption to WhatsApp was repaired, workers who had their livelihood disrupted rushed to make up for lost time and money. There’s no guarantee there won’t be another outage, but most informal workers depend on the free, dynamic service to make a living. “We really depend on this service to be able to work in our day to day life,” Torres said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tHzypx"&gt;Leaving the platform for another isn’t really an option. The usage of WhatsApp in Brazil is practically an inescapable fact of daily life. Grohmann explains that workers wouldn’t move to other comms services because most Brazilians use WhatsApp. “A few people created accounts on Telegram when WhatsApp was down, but very few people in Brazil use other communication platforms other than WhatsApp,” he said. “Changing platforms wouldn’t mean better communication with clients.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple botched the MacBook Pro notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x9TlV48LFAI48qHXlzAIzozo3O0=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70015766/Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_inch_Final_Cut_Pro_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxYGjp"&gt;The day that many have been dreading has finally arrived. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;Apple has added a notch to its new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. And somehow, Apple — notch pros at this point — managed to utterly botch the notch. Because the new MacBook Pros completely missed out on the most important part of the notch: &lt;em&gt;adding Face ID&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePfAmo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"&gt;I’ve been on the record&lt;/a&gt; of being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/6/18057258/macbook-air-update-face-id-notch-bezel-security"&gt;extremely pro-MacBook notch&lt;/a&gt;: back in 2018, I argued that Apple &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do exactly what it’s done here: add a notch to its MacBook laptops, taking up the exact width of the persistent menu bar that already permanently lives on the top of its macOS software (barring the occasional dip into a full-screen app). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VsI5JT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The MacBook Air needs Face ID and a delightful notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/6/18057258/macbook-air-update-face-id-notch-bezel-security"},{"title":"The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tQHLHR"&gt;And to be fair, Apple has actualized most of the benefits of a notch: smaller bezels, particularly at the top of the display, allowing for Apple to at least play in the same ballpark (if still not quite on the same level) as the ultra-thin bezels that have become the norm on premium Windows laptops from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yZ10E"&gt;Which is why the lack of Face ID here is such a glaring miss. As a means of visual identity across its product lineup, the notch is practically synonymous with Face ID on Apple’s devices. Seeing one here (and then not offering the tech) is incongruous right off the bat. It starts things off on the wrong foot; sure, most people don’t &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the idea of a notch, but usually, there’s the acceptance that you’re getting the addition of Face ID. Here the cost of the notch returns far fewer rewards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Xq8j"&gt;It’s possible that there are still technical issues here: maybe the Face ID module is just too big to fit into a laptop display, although Apple managed to fit it into both its iPhone and iPad hardware just fine. The existence of any number of IR-powered Windows Hello facial unlock systems would also indicate that the challenges (if they even exist) can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a68sYc"&gt; Plus, look at the thickness of Apple’s new MacBook Pro lid:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6ouCH7C7m5U_ybPSfd_JQVpctE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938870/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBoLCy"&gt;You’re telling me that can’t fit a Face ID module? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phou79"&gt;The hardware is all there: the M1 Pro and M1 Max share the same architecture as the A-series chips that Apple has offered for years, and Apple already offers Face ID on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;its M1-powered iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple’s notch already conceals a few extra components: as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pogue/status/1450489697382408192"&gt;David Pogue notes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the cutout also hides Apple’s TrueTone sensor, light sensor, and an LED status light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Quzzv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As you evaluate your opinion on the MacBook Pro’s notch, keep in mind that it houses more than just a 1080p camera. It also houses the TrueTone sensor (colors consistent in all lighting conditions), light sensor (adjusts brightness/keyboard illumination), and “camera on” LED. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XpKvhvtEWn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XpKvhvtEWn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Pogue (@Pogue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pogue/status/1450489697382408192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KhtKML"&gt;It’s easy to imagine Apple integrating a lot of the useful things that Face ID does on its phones directly into its laptops. The highly marketed ability to instantly boot the new MacBook Pros with the ultra-fast M1 Pro and M1 Max chips could go even faster by unlocking your computer before you’ve even touched the keyboard. Face ID’s password unlocks would be incredibly convenient on websites since you’re already staring at your computer the whole time. And Apple would get to play up its Animoji and Memoji avatars with the sorts of wacky demos the company thinks are hilarious at its events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQbge7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple even says that Face ID is more secure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YwhXQZ"&gt;The lack of Face ID means that Apple is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; playing catch up to Windows. The past few years have seen Windows Hello facial recognition unlocking become more and more of a standard feature across laptops. Apple, meanwhile, despite arguably doing the most to popularize facial recognition unlocking (and Face ID) for personal tech, is still weirdly sitting on the sideline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La6en2"&gt;Plus, there’s the security aspect. Apple &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; to brag about how secure its computers are. And yet, the company insists on locking down its computers exclusively with Touch ID — security tech that is, by Apple’s own estimations, orders of magnitudes less secure. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204587"&gt;According to Apple’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;, the odds of guessing a four-digit passcode are 1 in 10,000. The odds of someone else having a matching fingerprint to unlock Touch ID on your computer are 1 in 50,000. But Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108"&gt;also says&lt;/a&gt; that the probability of a random person managing to unlock your device using Face ID is a whooping 1 in 1,000,000. Apple has better biometric security available that it could put on its laptops; it’s just choosing not to, year after year and redesign after redesign. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjFa_Ynp8kmOnhpfBkcU_mo9AdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938880/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The notch has arrived, whether you like it or not&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iD84Cf"&gt;Apple — and customers — do both still like Touch ID, at least conceptually. The argument for fingerprint-based biometrics has become a stronger one when wearing a mask for health purposes defeats a lot of the convenience of Face ID. And there have been rumors for years that Apple has been planning to bring back Touch ID to its iPhones in the form of an in-display sensor. But if Apple really is worried about losing some of the convenience of Touch ID, it could simply offer both security options, taking the bold step of actually letting its customers decide which biometric method they’d like to use. Or Apple could really take a stance on security and let users use &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Touch ID and Face ID for even more secure biometric authentication, giving the company more security stats to tout and customers an extra layer of security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUZrdV"&gt;A notch for Face ID would have been acceptable — even great. Or maybe Apple really, truly believed that Touch ID was the right solution for its computers and that all the new MacBook Pros needed was a higher resolution webcam and smaller bezels. But in that case, Apple could have tried to engineer a hole-punch camera, like those found on virtually every major Android flagship, for a more seamless look and feel that would still allow it to cut down the bezels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbb7vL"&gt;But instead, the new MacBook Pros are stuck in a terrible no man’s land: all the size of a notch, without any of the utility. &lt;/p&gt;
