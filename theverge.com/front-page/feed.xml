    <title>Apple’s app tracking transparency feature isn’t an instant privacy button</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByQJj0"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; acts as a reminder of what Apple’s App Tracking Transparency settings do and do not do to protect your privacy (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/apple-reaches-quiet-truce-over-iphone-privacy-changes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While asking apps to not track you does keep them from collecting and selling data tied to your personal advertising identity, it doesn’t keep developers from collecting any information about you at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAawK0"&gt;The feature, introduced in iOS 14.5, is meant to prevent app-makers from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;tracking what you do and selling that information to advertisers&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;cried foul when it was introduced&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it would hurt their ability to show targeted, personalized ads, and therefore hurt businesses that relied on those ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1GJHu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9G2ObX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies have turned to aggregated and anonymized data, which still comes from individuals&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WDIM97"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, though, developers have taken Apple’s rules to mean that they’re allowed to target ads at cohorts, or groups that people are put into without needing to have unique IDs assigned. The report says that developers like Snap, Inc. have continued collecting some data, including from those who have asked them not to track them, with the justification that anything that could be tied to an individual user would be anonymized and grouped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfnW4L"&gt;It’s a similar concept to FLoC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Google’s plan for a post-third-party cookie internet&lt;/a&gt;, where individuals are assigned labels describing what kind of things they might buy instead of being tracked individually. Ads can still be targeted, without advertisers having to keep track of everything everyone does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RCvaE"&gt;Some developers &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/10/more-details-emerge-on-how-snap-facebook-and-others-are-skirting-app-tracking-transparency/"&gt;have admitted&lt;/a&gt;, though, that they also try to make predictions about what users do after seeing ads based on info they receive from ad companies. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;also says that some personalized data, like IP address, location, and screen size, still makes its way to advertisers, to help ensure that ads fit properly and show up in the right language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFJlqH"&gt;According to the report, Facebook and many other companies are planning on selling ads using aggregated or anonymized data. While Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;partially blamed Apple’s policies&lt;/a&gt; for it missing its earnings goals last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;it’s estimated&lt;/a&gt; that the ads affected by the rules only made up 5 percent of its annual ad revenue. In other words, Apple’s ad tracking permissions were never going to destroy Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77cmgb"&gt;None of this is to say that there are no privacy benefits to hitting the “Ask app not to track” button — a previous &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation found that Snap, Inc, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22756135/apple-app-tracking-transparency-policy-snapchat-facebook-twitter-youtube-lose-10-billion"&gt;lost $10 billion combined after the feature was implemented&lt;/a&gt;, so there was obviously a market for ads driven by that data. But it’s good to remember that even Apple, a company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;prides itself on “standing up” for its users&lt;/a&gt;, can’t stop companies from collecting your data with a single switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z2xR9j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to&amp;amp;nbsp;use the iOS app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"},{"title":"Keep it Locked","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22796344/cybersecurity-how-to-protect-hacked-account"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Multiple deaths confirmed after tornado hits Amazon warehouse</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjXXNX"&gt;An Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois collapsed following a bout of severe weather and tornados that ripped across the Midwest and South on Friday night. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at least two deaths have been confirmed, and a number of workers are still unaccounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lV7Daf"&gt;&lt;a href="http://facebook.com/collinsvilleEMA/posts/269327955226516"&gt;A post&lt;/a&gt; on Illinois’ Collinsville Emergency Management Agency’s Facebook page called the collapse a “mass casualty” incident. It &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=269627795196532&amp;amp;set=a.222212819938030"&gt;later posted&lt;/a&gt; an update with a photo of the event’s aftermath, showing a large portion of the warehouse completely torn away by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W83334"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Workers killed in Amazon warehouse collapse following severe weather in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/edwardsville?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#edwardsville&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/amazon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#amazon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stlwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#stlwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tornado?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#tornado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q9HTdgEJFa"&gt;https://t.co/q9HTdgEJFa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FOX2now (@FOX2now) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FOX2now/status/1469634191616884739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6wNxM"&gt;During a press conference this morning, police chief Mike Fillback told reporters that authorities have had trouble finding out “how many people we actually had at that facility at the time because it’s not a set staff.” Amazon management was at the scene to help create a list of staff members who are accounted for, however, Fillback notes that it’s still difficult to determine how many people remain trapped inside the collapsed building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0gxx"&gt;Around 30 people reportedly made it out of the facility safely. While some were transported by bus to a safe area and reunited with family, others were able to leave the scene on their own (via &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/least-one-person-dead-severe-weather-event-illinois-amazon-warehouse-rcna8464"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It remains unclear how many people were originally in the building, but Fillback estimates it might’ve been around 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcgDJ3"&gt;“The safety and well-being of our employees and partners is our top priority right now,” Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re assessing the situation and will share additional information when it’s available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qo8WF"&gt;Illinois wasn’t the only state affected by the severe storms. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1469683523447664642?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 70 fatalities are expected in Kentucky, while one was killed after a possible tornado hit a nursing home in Arkansas. President Joe Biden sent out a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1469683523447664642"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; this morning, stating that the administration is “working with Governors to ensure they have what they need as the search for survivors and damage assessments continue.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXbcjo"&gt;By now, you’ve probably heard of NFTs enough to have an opinion about them, and, as it turns out, so has Keanu Reeves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="z3PH5p"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825102/keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-interview-matrix-awakens-epic-games"&gt;our interview&lt;/a&gt; with him and fellow &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; icon Carrie-Ann Moss, Alex Heath asked the actors about their feelings on cryptocurrency, NFT collectibles, and the concept of digital scarcity. Keanu — described in &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/16/20694479/keanu-reeves-in-2019-revival-memes-history-explained"&gt;this 2019 &lt;em&gt;Vox &lt;/em&gt;profile of his Keanaissance&lt;/a&gt; as a “relatable geek” — had, of course, a relatable response (tweeted earlier by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dz/status/1469424767488962570"&gt;David Zhou&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfFYnp"&gt;He laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0rp9r"&gt;And not just a little either, as the idea of digital trinkets conveying ownership even though the actual content remains, as he says, “easily reproduced” is enough to have Neo himself bent over at the waist. When he recovered, he asked Moss if they’re getting a cut from the sales, so maybe he’ll take it more seriously once someone tweets relentlessly at him about the glorious potential of smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LNmvS"&gt;It’s not like Reeves doesn’t know about the blockchain, as he also said he owns cryptocurrency that a friend bought for him. However, he is all about HODLing and isn’t actively trading any of it yet. You can find out more about their thoughts on the metaverse, explaining &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; to teens who don’t think living in a wholly digital reality is a scary idea, and Warner Bros.’ missed videogame opportunities in the nearly 19-minute interview &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825102/keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-interview-matrix-awakens-epic-games"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch these Excel pros duke it out in a financial modeling competition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_DFU__nC20qPtQ-2upfp5_3dIZ4=/0x0:2415x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258817/ms_excel_modeling_competition.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Diarmuid Early competes in the second round of the Financial Modeling World Cup. | Image: Financial Modeling World Cup | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4ae0qpB2r0" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OjGqL4"&gt;Microsoft is sponsoring an esports competition with prizes totaling $10,000. The game? Well, it’s not exactly a game — it’s Microsoft Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUUsGj"&gt;Every year, the top Microsoft Excel users (&lt;em&gt;players?&lt;/em&gt;) from around the world face off in the Financial Modeling World Cup (FMWC) (via &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/559001/the-future-of-esports-is-microsoft-excel-and-its-on-espn.html/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The qualifying rounds already took place, leaving just eight Excel masters to compete for the FMWC crown. The quarter-finals, semifinals, and final round all take place today at 12PM ET via a YouTube livestream and the ESPN app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ut7X0M"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NSU11kxxJvc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2WNMCh"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.fmworldcup.com/rules/"&gt;FMWC rules&lt;/a&gt;, competitors are presented with a one to five-page long case study during each round. Case studies contain real-world problems, along with six to 15 questions that vary in complexity — the more complex a question, the more points are awarded to the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibfXLD"&gt;Participants will, of course, have to use their financial modeling skills to determine the answer to each question. The sample cases on the &lt;a href="https://www.fmworldcup.com/sample-cases/"&gt;FMWC site&lt;/a&gt; can give you a glimpse of what kinds of problems these Excel pros solve have to solve, some of which they may encounter during a typical workday, and others, dubbed “freestyle,” might have a more unusual subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v02fp"&gt;And if you never thought you’d get amped up over an Excel tournament, think again.  Surprisingly enough, watching a livestream of the FMWC feels just as exciting as watching your typical esports event, complete with announcers, live commentary, and a scoreboard. It even has a &lt;a href="https://smash.gg/tournament/fmwc-open/event/last-128-last-64-round/brackets/1017600/1602399"&gt;bracket system&lt;/a&gt; to track the progress of the competition, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.fmworldcup.com/rankings/"&gt;ranking system&lt;/a&gt; — appropriately made with an Excel spreadsheet — with Diarmuid Early of New York at the top of the global leaderboard, followed by Anup Agarwal of India, and Andrew Ngai of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPVRjr"&gt;The FMWC isn’t the only competition of its kind, either — the &lt;a href="https://www.moschampionship.com/"&gt;Microsoft Office Specialist World Championship&lt;/a&gt; covers the entire Office suite, including Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16152310/microsoft-office-specialist-mos-world-championship-2017"&gt;challenges students to become the “Microsoft Champion.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin launches Michael Strahan, Laura Shepard Churchley and others to space and back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QS5mYhFz7IhQjM5idIar_A4DwX4=/275x0:2563x1525/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258688/blue_origin_liftoff.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpaiuDg_DN4" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4qZMk"&gt;This morning, space tourism venture Blue Shepard successfully launched its third crew of passengers to space and back on the company’s New Shepard rocket, the first time a group of six people has flown together on the vehicle. The crew included GMA host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Alan Shepard — the first American in space and the namesake for the New Shepard rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzeEVv"&gt;New Shepard lifted off just after 10AM ET on Saturday morning from Blue Origin’s launch facility in Van Horn, Texas. The entire flight lasted just over 10 minutes from liftoff to touch down. Riding inside a crew capsule on top of the New Shepard rocket, the six-person crew climbed to an altitude of 351,225 feet, or more than 66 miles above the Earth, what is considered to be above the boundary to space. After experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness, the capsule carrying the crew touched down on the Texas desert floor, while the New Shepard booster successfully landed upright on a landing pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LgoaeX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Before today’s launch, Blue Origin had only flown crews of four to space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzhpfs"&gt;Also included in today’s crew were Evan Dick, an engineer and investor, as well as Lane Bess, the founder of Bess Ventures and Advisory. Bess brought along his son, Cameron Bess, making them the first father and child duo to ride to space together. The final crew member was Dylan Taylor, the CEO of Voyager space and active investor in the space industry. These four were all paying customers for this flight, while Strahan and Churchley were “honored guests.” Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their seat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bBKVfW"&gt;Once back on the ground, Strahan described the sight of the Earth from the capsule to a group of people that included Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos. Then someone asked him if the planet was around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Goo7y"&gt;“Okay, Kyrie Irving,” Strahan replied. Irving, a basketball player for the Boston Celtics, once proclaimed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/movies/kyrie-irving-nba-celtics-earth.html"&gt;he believed the Earth was flat&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24863899/kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-apologizes-saying-earth-flat"&gt;he has since said he was “sorry” about saying that publicly&lt;/a&gt;. In response to Strahan’s joke, Bezos shouted out, “Flat Earther!” Strahan also said he wanted to do the flight again, but Bezos joked he’d have to pay for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="X7QH6O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Strahan said he wanted to do the flight again, but Bezos joked he’d have to pay for the next one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GerbPI"&gt;Churchley talked to Bezos about her experience compared to the one her father had back in 1961, when he flew to suborbital space on a Mercury-Redstone rocket. “Gosh he didn’t even get to enjoy what I’m going to get enjoy,” Churchley said about her thoughts ahead of the flight. “He was working!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytAnmj"&gt;Before today’s launch, Blue Origin had only flown crews of four to space on New Shepard. The company’s first crewed launch in July famously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;launched Bezos&lt;/a&gt;, as well as legendary female aviator Wally Funk. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724058/blue-origin-william-shatner-new-shepard-flight-success"&gt;The second flight in October included actor William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;, best known for playing Captain James Kirk on the TV show Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF0eqc"&gt;All six of the passengers on today’s flight should receive their commercial astronaut wings from the Federal Aviation Administration, which has historically given the small pins to people who fly above 50 miles. However, this week the FAA announced it would be ending this practice by the end of the year, citing the advent of the commercial space tourism era. Moving forward, it will now list all future spacefarers who fly above 50 miles on the agency’s website instead. That means the six people on today’s flight may be the last fliers to receive the FAA’s wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHfO51"&gt;Today’s flight comes after the FAA says it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22827900/blue-origin-new-shepard-launch-michael-strahan-faa-investigation-watch-live"&gt;closed an investigation into Blue Origin’s safety culture&lt;/a&gt;. The FAA initially opened an investigation in October, after 21 former and current employees at the company penned an essay, accusing Blue Origin of culture rife with sexual harassment and safety concerns. However, the FAA tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it found “no specific safety issues” after looking into the claims.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Invasion feels like the first chapter of a sci-fi epic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBT6IX4NQ20qtGe-IsN-TpUjf4I=/482x0:3359x1918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258618/Invasion_Photo_011006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9n9RgM"&gt;The first season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; on Apple TV Plus feels a little incomplete. Across its 10 episodes, which chart a handful of humans grappling with an alien invasion, the story slowly teases out the reality of what’s happening. There are hints here and there — a haunting artificial voice, a mysterious alien-killing weapon, a kid with seizures that may or may not show the future — but the biggest reveal of all doesn’t even happen until the very last shot in the final episode. It still managed to pull me in — but that pull has a lot to do with potential. Rather than standing on its own, the initial season of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; feels like the first chapter of a much grander science fiction epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83ezo3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; gets off to a slow start&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most stories about an alien invasion, which tend to focus on the alien part, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; lingers on human trauma. Early on, there’s barely even a mention of the invading extraterrestrials. Instead,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt;’s global story tracks a handful of different threads spread across the world, which ultimately end up loosely connected. Each has some tie to the otherworldly events: there’s a young boy in London who is prone to seizures that may be connected to the invasion; a family from Long Island that’s struggling with infidelity and also happens to possibly have a weapon that can kill the aliens; a space engineer in Japan who seems to be the only one able to communicate with them; and an American soldier who is separated from his squad in Afghanistan after what appears to be an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDs0Zv"&gt;The show does a great job of making you care about these characters, mostly because you spend so much time with them. You understand why the engineer is working tirelessly to find a stranded astronaut after lots of long, heartfelt scenes revealing their secret relationship. Likewise, while the soldier comes across as a jerk initially, his slowly revealed backstory ultimately turns him into a sympathetic figure. There’s lots of great character development going on, but it also requires patience since it takes quite a while to get to the actual aliens. For the first half of the season, it’s mostly just hints that there’s something going on beyond a natural disaster of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTc2-wBP-YFwG77benxDHPBkg08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079599/Invasion_Photo_011001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pzxnjQ"&gt;This all means that when the aliens do finally appear, it’s a huge deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776188/invasion-apple-tv-plus-episode-6-aliens"&gt;The reveal is great&lt;/a&gt; and neatly changes the tone of the show. From then on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; becomes something different, balancing out its character drama (which never fully goes away, thankfully) with some intriguing alien mysteries and the flat-out horror of dealing with the invaders. There’s a terrifying scene in a secluded house, where a family tries to sneak away from one of the spiked blob creatures; later, we see the soldier making his way through a war-torn hospital amidst an infestation as if this was a first-person &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgcp5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You never get much in the way of answers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXaQXi"&gt;What you don’t get are much in the way of answers. There are some small revelations, like when you learn that the London teen had visions of the invasion before it happened or when it appears that the Japanese researcher discovers how the aliens communicate. But nothing is ever clear. Even when it seems like the aliens have been defeated, the show throws another twist at you. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Mystery is important, and those unknowns are part of what has kept me coming back. But the result is that season 1 doesn’t feel like a complete story, with its own distinct arc. It’s 10 episodes of setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZ9WrR"&gt;The good news is that Apple revealed earlier this week that &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is coming back for a second season, with co-creator Simon Kinberg saying they would be “expanding our universe in the most intimate and epic ways.” And after a full season of setting things up, I’m anxious to see where it’s finally going.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest AirPods are selling for just $140 at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TrE5Uxh3_92cAbphTpiq9WQOFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258564/IMG_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m_9003484103508200907J9So2B"&gt;Things have chilled out considerably this week, both in terms of how cold it has become in parts of the US and how few deals there are compared to the hectic Black Friday and Cyber Monday extravaganza. However, that’s not to say there aren’t some fantastic offers happening both in-store and online. We’ll be keeping a close eye on deals in the next few weeks to make sure you get what you’re looking for ahead of the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bF0hQ1"&gt;Alright, let’s get to the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pfojO4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1BGXAl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Save $40 on the third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U9bNqV"&gt;I can’t remember the last time an Apple product was discounted so swiftly. That’s what is happening to the third-gen AirPods, which debuted at $179, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but are now just $139.99&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon (the correct price will reflect at checkout). While they resemble the AirPods Pro with their shorter stems, the latest AirPods lack active noise cancellation, and they rest in your ear instead of fitting snugly via the Pro’s included silicon tips. Those differences may not matter to some people, and if you’re one of those people, check out this deal before it expires. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2v7Dm0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G9J44ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can find the Xbox Series S in stock right now at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ7j2j"&gt;While its bigger, more powerful $499.99 Xbox Series X sibling is tough to find, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G9J44ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $299.99 Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; is comparatively bountiful. At the time of publishing, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G9J44ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling stock for the MSRP price&lt;/a&gt;, and for Prime members, you’ll have a shot at getting &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09H73LTM6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the special edition console for $299.99&lt;/a&gt; that includes in-game currency for both &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xmC4Qw"&gt;

&lt;p id="pvk6SZ"&gt;Presumably for a limited time, HP is offering a fairly capable configuration of its Omen 16 gaming laptop &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals121121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fomen-by-hp-laptop-16-c0035nr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $1,304.99&lt;/a&gt; when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;WINTER10 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout (h/t &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15492136-hp-omen-16-c0035nr-16-1-fhd-144hz-ryzen-7-5800h-rtx-3070-16gb-ddr4-512gb-pcie-ssd-win11h-1304-99-f-s?src=popular_recombee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The price is impressive when you consider what’s inside of this laptop. You’re getting a 16.1-inch FHD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB M.2 PCIe SSD, and most impressively, an RTX 3070 graphics chip with 115W of total graphics power. Most gaming laptops at this price range include the RTX 3060.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="m_9003484103508200907jOxh3U"&gt;If you have a PC or an Xbox, you can (and should) play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; on the cheap with a Game Pass subscription. For new PC subscribers, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals121121&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fpc-game-pass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Game Pass costs just $1&lt;/a&gt; for the first three months of service ($9.99 per month after that) and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeals121121&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%3FlaunchStore%3DCFQ7TTC0KHS0%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs $1&lt;/a&gt; for the first month (costing $14.99 monthly afterward). Whichever one you choose, that’s plenty of time to play through the campaign, and to see if its multiplayer component digs its talons into your brain, making you just a little addicted (I’m totally not speaking from personal experience. Nope, not at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFboGb"&gt;Of course, you don’t need Game Pass to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. You can pay $60 for the game... or on second though, just get Game Pass. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; campaign review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wtuMus"&gt;Logitech’s stellar G435 wireless gaming headset is $10 off&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s creators say your wildest stunts are part of the series’ DNA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9x0XedIxINewcjz94GQOfsIcVlA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258273/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_3.51.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTuber “Mint Blitz” found a way to soar through the air in &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK8beuE0-d0" target="_blank"&gt;Mint Blitz on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Xnbut"&gt;On Monday, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MintBlitz/status/1467839509291167744"&gt;jaw-dropping &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; video&lt;/a&gt; kept showing up on my Twitter feed that looked like something out of a &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; speedrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCYKUr"&gt;The video, from Australian YouTuber “Mint Blitz,” begins with Master Chief armed with a massive hammer behind a Warthog vehicle. In an impressive sequence taking place over a matter of seconds, Mint Blitz swings the hammer to send the Warthog flying while almost simultaneously using Master Chief’s new grappling hook on the vehicle to slingshot himself into the air like Spider-Man. As he’s soaring high above Zeta Halo’s treetops, he uses the thruster powerup — and then, inexplicably, just keeps flying forward. After 39 seconds in the air, he finally lands, gracefully setting down on top of a tall tower that’s likely supposed to otherwise be inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J7vkya"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This Changes EVERYTHING &lt;a href="https://t.co/j3fIGw4oxA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/j3fIGw4oxA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mint Blitz (@MintBlitz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MintBlitz/status/1467839509291167744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0nxnZX"&gt;Mint Blitz is almost assuredly doing something &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; developer 343 Industries never specifically intended. I can’t imagine that players are supposed to be able to fly straight forward without falling for more than half a minute. But based on a conversation I had with 343 Industries, it seems like the studio is fine with letting players figure out how to do similarly outlandish stunts and doesn’t plan to patch those sorts of things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mP1eUQ"&gt;“It would actually have to be something that causes the game to lock up for us to be wanting to stop it,” 343 Industries associate creative director Paul Crocker tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I’d love it if someone managed to speedrun the game by using some crazy combination of mechanics to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYM4Id"&gt;“Unless it’s brick-blocking player progression or their ability to enjoy the game, we’ll fix it,” adds character director Stephen Dyck. “Those are the types of things we patch. Otherwise, we love seeing that kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6mZZV"&gt;Dyck argues that pushing the boundaries is something that’s “part of &lt;em&gt;Halo’s&lt;/em&gt; DNA.” He gave an example of trying to squeeze a vehicle where you technically aren’t supposed to. “If the player wants to invest time and energy into doing that, and then ultimately they’re successful, and they get the vehicle where they technically weren’t supposed to? Awesome,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jNO1UP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re totally able to do that”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="keyGkN"&gt;Crocker shared the story of a time the development team spent two hours trying to get a Ghost (kind of an alien hovercraft speeder) into a certain building. “When they wrote up this huge bug [report] about, ‘I can get a Ghost in, we need to fix this,’ we went, ‘Nope. You’re totally able to do that,’” Crocker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLzGrf"&gt;Seeing the things players end up doing also inspires the team for things they make down the line, according to Dyck. “We’ll see interesting things that players are gravitating towards, and we’re like, ‘Cool, yeah, we’ll lean into that one.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkqU1e"&gt;Pushing worlds to their limits can give games extended lives. People are still actively &lt;a href="https://www.speedrun.com/botw#Any"&gt;shaving time off &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;speedruns&lt;/a&gt; more than four and a half years after its original release, for example. And &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans have already shown they’re a persistent bunch, having spent seven years trying to get &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-reach-players-spent-seven-years-trying-to-get-into-1823356029"&gt;into a cutscene room in &lt;em&gt;Halo: Reach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGyVZb"&gt;343 Industries hasn’t said what’s next for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign, so we don’t know how the next chapter on Zeta Halo may unfold. But while we’re waiting for what’s to come, I’m looking forward to seeing whatever tricks top Mint Blitz’s epic flight across the map — and it seems like 343 will be, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch as Blue Origin plans to launch its first crew of six to space, with Michael Strahan on board</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/npkEyZ3FZPeE0PGcB_soFTKl_70=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70258084/blueorigin_ns19_barntour_l_2_1639079187.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4it0ZE"&gt;This morning, Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company Blue Origin is slated to launch another crew of customers to the edge of space and back. The crew cabin will be a little more crowded than usual: a total of six passengers will ride to space inside Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourist rocket, the largest group the company has ever sent up on one flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3kOps"&gt;That makes this flight a bit unusual. The launch also comes after an FAA investigation into the safety of Blue Origin’s rockets came to an inconclusive resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iM4Rtd"&gt;On board are a mixture of celebrity guests and paying spaceflight enthusiasts. Notably, Michael Strahan, a host for &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt; and former NFL rusher for the New York Giants, will be flying, along with Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space. Both are considered guests, so they did not pay for their seats. Flying with them are paying customers: Evan Dick, an investor, Lane Bess, the founder of Bess Ventures, and Bess’ son Cameron Bess. Dylan Taylor, a major investor in the spaceflight industry, will round out the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I73rNt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll be interesting to see how a crew of six fares&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJu1NC"&gt;This will be Blue Origin’s third time launching people to the edge of space from the company’s test facility in Van Horn, Texas. For all three of these missions, Blue Origin has made sure to have some kind of star on board. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;The company’s first crewed mission carried Bezos&lt;/a&gt;, as well as legendary female aviator Wally Funk, while the second flight notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724058/blue-origin-william-shatner-new-shepard-flight-success"&gt;carried William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;, best known for playing Captain James T. Kirk on &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. For those first two tourist flights, however, Blue Origin only flew crews of four. Videos from inside the crew cabin showed that the interior &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpiBhOQrtPo"&gt;got somewhat crowded&lt;/a&gt;, even with such small complements of people. It’ll be interesting to see how a crew of six fares, which is the maximum number of people the capsule is supposed to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfpbJWpIJkIBWPVm3titShki3GU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080220/blueorigin_ns19_strahanseatsmiling_l_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Strahan training in one of New Shepard’s passenger seats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XFgFOx"&gt;The flight comes just after the Federal Aviation Administration confirms that it closed an investigation into Blue Origin’s safety culture without finding any substantial issues. The FAA, which is responsible for issuing licenses for commercial rocket launches, started looking into the company in early October &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;after 21 current and former employees at Blue Origin published an essay&lt;/a&gt; alleging a culture of rampant sexual harassment and safety concerns with the company’s rockets. The essay, penned by former Blue Origin head of employee communications Alexandra Abrams, argued that employees are too scared to speak about safety violations over fears of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUWIGw"&gt;“In the opinion of an engineer who has signed on to this essay, ‘Blue Origin has been lucky that nothing has happened so far,’” the essay stated. “Many of this essay’s authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="iHV91c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the FAA found “no specific safety issues” after investigating allegations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0hyVpJ"&gt;When the essay came out, the FAA said it was “reviewing the information.” However, as CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/10/tech/blue-origin-safety-review-whistleblower-scn/index.html"&gt;first reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt; and the FAA confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; its investigation is now over. Steven Kulm, a public affairs specialist at the FAA, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the FAA found “no specific safety issues” after investigating allegations made against the company’s human spaceflight program. When asked for comment, Linda Mills, the vice president for communications at Blue Origin, said, “The FAA statement is accurate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRwGHO"&gt;However, in an email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, FAA representatives explained to Abrams that the agency was unable to conduct a thorough investigation because no additional engineering or safety experts from Blue Origin came forward to discuss issues at the company that were raised in Abrams’ letter. The emails show that FAA investigators put the burden on Abrams to convince her former colleagues to speak up. Abrams passed along key information to the investigators, including email exchanges between Blue Origin employees detailing concerns over capsule recovery operations and a memo crafted by a departing employee about safety concerns. She also got nearly three people to provide written statements, but the individuals ultimately backed out over fears of their identities being disclosed, Abrams tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In an email to Abrams, the FAA noted that those who came forward could not be guaranteed protection because there are no statutes in place to protect whistleblowers at space companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xt4wes"&gt;A copy of the FAA’s email to Abrams, sent on December 6th, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vjrHXW"&gt;It has been several weeks since our last contact with you and although we know you did everything possible to try and persuade members of your group to come forward, no technical experts have reached out to us or provided any specific documentation regarding the safety allegations. We understand that there are no federal “whistleblower protection” statutes protecting employees of commercial space companies from retaliation resulting from reporting safety issues. This is in stark contrast to the extensive protections available to commercial aviation industry whistleblowers. We believe this was an enormous factor in our inability to pursue this investigation further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSPEBZ"&gt;Following a thorough review of the limited information provided, multiple discussions with you, and consulting the applicable law and regulations, the FAA could not investigate this matter in depth, and thus, could not substantiate the safety concerns described in the document you provided. No further actions can be recommended at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Lp2xt"&gt;Currently, the commercial space industry benefits from little federal oversight regarding safety, thanks to something called the&lt;a href="https://www.theregreview.org/2015/12/31/rathz-space-commerce-regulation/"&gt; US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act passed in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The law prohibits the FAA or other federal agencies from placing safety regulations on the commercial space industry until 2023. The impetus for the law was to allow a space industry that’s still in its infancy to continue to grow and innovate without “burdensome” regulations. That means when the FAA issues launch licenses, it is only responsible for making sure that a rocket launch will not harm uninvolved people or property on the ground. The agency cannot dictate rules for how commercial space companies should make their vehicles or operations safer. &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-ends-commercial-space-astronaut-wings-program-will-recognize-individuals-reaching"&gt;Commercial space tourists fly through “informed consent&lt;/a&gt;,” meaning they agree that the trip they are taking is inherently dangerous and risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4hTr6"&gt;After the original essay was published in October, the company stood by its culture. “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct,” a Blue Origin spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymMSD1"&gt;To get passengers to the edge of space and back, Blue Origin relies on its New Shepard rocket, a reusable vehicle designed to launch upright from Earth and then land upright back on the ground again. Passengers ride on top of the vehicle inside a crew cabin with reclined seats and large windows. Once the rocket reaches a certain altitude, the cabin separates from the top of the rocket and enters space, allowing the riders to experience a few moments of weightlessness. Both the capsule and the rocket return to Earth; the rocket lands upright, while the capsule touches down gently using parachutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLIh5U"&gt;Typically, New Shepard reaches an altitude of roughly 62 miles up when it flies, which most consider to be above the boundary to space. When today’s passengers return to Earth, all of them should be awarded commercial astronaut wings by the FAA. These wings have historically been given to people who fly above 50 miles on a commercial spacecraft. However, &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-ends-commercial-space-astronaut-wings-program-will-recognize-individuals-reaching"&gt;the FAA announced this week that it will be ending this practice&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year and will merely list all future commercial tourists and flyers who reach space on the agency’s website. That means this crew may be the last ones to ever get the wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msNQ9L"&gt;Today’s New Shepard launch is slated for takeoff this morning at 9:45AM ET out of Blue Origin’s launch site in Van Horn. Blue Origin plans to begin live coverage 90 minutes ahead of launch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG C1 OLED vs. Samsung Odyssey Neo G9: the perfect monitor doesn’t exist</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Still searching for endgame&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PiA5Kg"&gt;I hate leaving unfinished business, but that’s what I did on November 27th of last year. I ended my review of the most ridiculous, most advanced PC monitor ever made — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt; — by wondering out loud whether a similarly sized OLED television might actually be better. That question has been burning in my skull for many, many months, but I’m happy to say I finally have an answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ubv9Bo"&gt;This September, I took delivery of&lt;em&gt; both&lt;/em&gt; LG’s latest 48-inch C1 OLED television &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Samsung’s upgraded 49-inch Odyssey Neo G9, with its Mini-LED backlit screen that attempts to rival OLED for deep blacks and adds explosive brightness. I’ve used them back to back ever since, swapping again and again between the latest and greatest gigantic gaming monitors and between work and play. I used them all day, every day, jotting down notes about every frustration and all the joy I experienced with these monster screens just a foot or two from my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFFXTO"&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m not sure I’m ready to go back to the comparatively puny 27-inch screen I actually own. But the funny thing is, my answer is neither. Neither of these screens is my PC monitor endgame. And I wasn’t even sad to see one of them go home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="qTXJTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10912306"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="vqQbGB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10912324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XpCuv8"&gt;First, the basics. Why a monitor versus a TV? Well, for a staggering $2,499, the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is arguably the most feature-packed gaming monitor ever made — and yet LG’s $1,299 48-inch OLED TV meets or beats it in most ways that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p80In8"&gt;For instance, the Samsung has a tremendous 5120 x 1440-pixel resolution panel that stretches out across your entire field of view, practically letting you bathe in games or tasks. But the sheer size of LG’s 48-inch 3840 x 2160 panel &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; fills your view at what’s technically a higher resolution (8.3M pixels vs. 7.4M pixels). It’s just that the corners of LG’s screen are a bit farther away from your face because it’s not curved like Samsung. (I have more to say about that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lALtVF"&gt;Both monitors have a similar footprint on a desk, too, at 45.3 inches wide for the Odyssey G9 and 42.2 inches wide for the 48-inch LG, but it feels like the LG provides &lt;em&gt;so much more &lt;/em&gt;screen in exchange. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;We’ve long made fun of small 16:9 laptop screens&lt;/a&gt; for being too short for productivity, but LG’s 24-inch-tall slab of pixels is far, far past the point where that’s an issue. Every time I swapped out the Neo G9 for the LG C1 (or vice versa), I had to ask myself why I would pay twice as much for a screen with the top and bottom chopped off when both fit fine on my &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fbekant-desk-white-s19006323%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F11%2F22815110%2Flg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;47-inch Ikea Bekant desk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ji6bxQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10913432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwyFFm"&gt;And while the Samsung monitor does reach twice the refresh rate at 240Hz, compared to 120Hz for the LG, highly technical review sites &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tools/compare/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-vs-lg-48-c1-oled/23186/24625?usage=3623&amp;amp;threshold=0.10#comparison_1425"&gt;like Rtings&lt;/a&gt; will tell you the LG is actually better when it comes to response time and blur (which is what we actually care about when we care about refresh rate). For variable refresh rate, both support Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium or Premium Pro, and the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;HDMI 2.1 with VRR&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Series X and (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383288/sony-ps5-update-hdr-options-120hz-pc-monitor-support-features"&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt;) the PS5 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yc6Pq"&gt;Wondering if a TV might guzzle more electricity than a dedicated monitor? It’s a fair question, but you might be surprised. Playing through the same exact section of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;with HDR, I averaged 68Wh per hour with the 48-inch LG, compared to 89Wh per hour with the Samsung Neo. When I added desktop apps, it was a bit closer: the LG consumed 85Wh per hour, while the Samsung drank 91Wh per hour on average. That’s with power saving settings turned off on the LG — and I’d recommend you do that right away because it’s &lt;em&gt;really dim&lt;/em&gt; out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NCnDP"&gt;Despite all this, it’s not necessarily that simple to swap your traditional monitor for&lt;em&gt; either&lt;/em&gt; of these gigantic panels. Let’s talk gaming, productivity, and lastly, we’ll spend a few words chatting about your desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve never played until you’ve seen the gorgeous colors OLED can bring out in a game like Genshin Impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mHlaV"&gt;Gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7Jc5vm"&gt;I’m not going to rehash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;my entire Samsung Odyssey G9 review&lt;/a&gt;, where I included 14 full-bleed images to show you what gaming is like on a 32:9 screen, but I’ll give you the TL;DR version here: super-ultrawide gaming is wonderful but &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. Playing on the Odyssey G9 and Neo G9 is incredibly immersive, but it’s also literally warped in a way I don’t always find pleasant because game developers never adopted &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6NbyEmPalA"&gt;multi-projection&lt;/a&gt; in their games. And in the year since that review, nothing’s changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lzynZ"&gt;I played a new bunch of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer, dove through all of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, and played through the entire &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; campaign swapping between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the LG C1 48. While all three of these games have perfectly adequate 32:9 support, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; even marketed it as a feature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;all of them have that stunted-and-zoomed look on the left and right sides of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2YRxdLJMkWq3xrD5NnOe4zGt7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925723/HaloInfinite_2021_10_02_14_56_13_996.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We had high hopes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;for Halo Infinite’s 32:9 monitor support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It looks neat, but I’m afraid the edges are pretty distorted.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4lB7Iry3RqRBZWvQkyahB9LvS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079879/Screenshot__40_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;2D games, like Duck Game, look great at 32:9. So do some 3D games; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;see my original review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVCAkY"&gt;I don’t always hate it. But I would never, ever choose to play them on the Odyssey Neo G9 &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of LG’s 48-inch gaming television, where every game &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; looks fantastic because they’re designed for 16:9 to begin with. It’s just as immersive, if not more so, given that you’ve got more screen and fewer distracting warped edges in view. And it doesn’t help Samsung that its monitor has some extremely strange results displaying HDR and 240Hz content, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gcSR3"&gt;Like I said, the LG set already punches harder than its Hz would suggest when it comes to busting blur, but the Samsung Neo G9 also appears to have weird problems with its 240Hz mode, most prominently that it will display visible horizontal lines across portions of the display, ones that are most visible on gradients, bright colors, or when the panel’s full-array local dimming gets particularly dark or bright all of a sudden. A big, splashy, story-critical explosion in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; was ruined for me when horizontal lines cut through what would otherwise have been an extremely impressive burst of flame — the kind of thing that the Neo’s peak brightness of 2000 nits makes so bright you might swear you can feel the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zh2jDx"&gt;Here’s a video example of what the horizontal lines look like when the screen gets dim: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T3KbVE"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung Odyssey G9 Neo 240Hz scanlines?|105191" data-volume-uuid="dc3b32ff8" data-volume-id="105191" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-263" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqpn2x"&gt;And I’m far from the only one who’s seen this issue — or the issues with HDR in general, where the Neo G9 shipped with HDR support that can charitably be described as “broken” and has only reached “partially acceptable” after months of firmware updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iBnHp"&gt;Originally, turning on HDR mode would wash out the colors of your entire Windows desktop, though that’s now fixed. But even after the latest firmware update (which you have to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgbabJ1u2jy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download on a PC&lt;/a&gt;, then apply directly to the monitor with a thumb drive after removing any USB peripherals from the monitor’s USB ports), some of the dark shadowy regions of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; look green and &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; looks like it’s being flooded by the headlights of a car. Tweaking luminance and color helped some, but the best result I could muster was still &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; shy of the fantastic results LG gave me without tweaking at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTVoW0"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; deserves serious credit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T7pogOgS_M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for pushing Samsung on these problems&lt;/a&gt;, going through multiple review units and feeding Samsung data, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUbJ8u5NVgE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techtesters&lt;/em&gt; recently testified&lt;/a&gt; they’d gone through three different review units as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXAHeM"&gt;It’s wild because last year’s Odyssey G9 also suffered from some quality control issues around its 240Hz mode (which didn’t work with some graphics cards out of the gate) and poor local dimming, and we figured a Neo G9 (at twice the price!) would solve both. But while the new Mini-LED full array local dimming provides those fantastic deep blacks around, say, the borders of a movie you’re watching, we aren’t seeing that in games where we definitely should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbQXdy"&gt;At 120Hz or 144Hz without HDR, the Odyssey Neo G9 was fairly satisfactory, not unlike the vanilla Odyssey G9 I tested last year. But that original G9 is also over $1,000 less expensive — and so is LG’s set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div id="cGONMF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10913611"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ic2ZCl"&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="786TOP"&gt;And yet, if you plan to get &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; done on your new gigantic screen, I can’t wholeheartedly recommend an LG TV, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea98C7"&gt;People ask me two questions: “Aren’t you worried about burn-in?” “Don’t you get headaches sitting two feet away from the TV?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLFtjP"&gt;The answer is that LG gives me my &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; of headache: I can get a literal headache because LG’s overzealous burn-in protections make the screen so dim it can lead to serious eyestrain, or I can spend my time worrying about that burn-in by turning some of those protections off in a hidden service menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeQdb8"&gt;In general, I am not worried about burn-in, the phenomenon where OLED subpixels (which have organic chemical compounds that emit their own light) can wear unevenly over time, creating ghostly images that stick around. Numerous OLED burn-in tests have shown that it can take thousands upon thousands of hours to see permanent retention even if you leave static content up on the screen. That’s because LG has built in a wide array of protections, including shifting around the pixels every so often, dimming logos and icons that don’t move, and dimming the entire screen if it doesn’t move enough or gets too bright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLs6WX"&gt;That last example can be weird in practice: if you expand a bright white web browser page (like the one you’re reading) from a window to fullscreen, you can watch the entire screen dim to a paper white instead. But I learned to live with that pretty quickly and maybe even prefer it to the sometimes-searing whites of the Samsung, particularly when Windows is set to HDR mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVNZUbmRtKaTOijhZ2dVAn4zaUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040339/shollister_211124_4893_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s how much I can fit on screen at my typical 125-percent scaling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mMlLD7"&gt;No, It’s the Temporal Peak Luminance Control (TPC), also sometimes called the Automatic Static Brightness Limiter, that sets my eyeballs on fire. I might be typing in a document or scrolling down a webpage, but the majority of the windows on my vast desktop aren’t moving, so the LG TV will &lt;em&gt;ever so slowly&lt;/em&gt; dip the entire brightness of the screen, so slowly I don’t even notice until the eyestrain creeps up on me. It’s about as dim as my laptop gets on the lowest setting, even if I’m using it in a bright room. I’ve tried everything to stop it, including various picture modes, reducing the TV’s brightness and even the individual OLED pixel brightness, but the only thing that stopped it was &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MKJ39170828-Replacement-Service-Remote-Control/dp/B075M91STG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying a special remote control designed for troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; and turning off “TPC” in the service menu. (Tap “In Start,” then type in 0413.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WC6WPd"&gt;No more headaches, but at what cost? I might have just voided this TV’s warranty, and I’ve started to see minor image retention after each day of use. (If I check a neutral gray image, I can sometimes see “seams” where the windows used to be.) So far, they’re always gone the next morning, likely thanks to LG’s automatic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fca_en%2Ftvs%2Foled-tvs%2Foled-reliability%2Fmain.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F11%2F22815110%2Flg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“pixel refresher,”&lt;/a&gt; but I’m still worried I may be aging the TV prematurely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp2LUs"&gt;Even if it weren’t for the brightness woes, I might still prefer the 32:9 Samsung monitor for multitasking, and it’s all thanks to that curve. Like I said in my original Odyssey G9 review, you can fit an astonishing amount on screen with the equivalent of two 27-inch monitors at your command, and the monitor’s unique 1000R curve puts it all at the same distance from your face at a crisp angular resolution. But with the 48-inch LG, text was uncomfortably small and / or pixelated unless I both pushed the TV back to two feet from my face &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ran Windows at 125 percent scaling for an effective resolution of 3072 x 1680 rather than 3840 x 2160. While I’ve been comfortable working that way for weeks, it’s simply not as much screen real estate as Samsung gives you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s G9 let you fit some things beneath the wings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SNXheG"&gt;What still separates a TV from a monitor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FxZAh8"&gt;I hope it’s clear by now that these screens are an &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt;, not just in money but in physical space. I’m lucky to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725010/ncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a particularly compact Mini-ITX tower&lt;/a&gt; as my gaming rig because even it barely fits behind the Samsung on my desk and only works with the LG because it’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; small it can piggyback on the TV’s stand. With the LG, I also needed to awkwardly loop my keyboard cable around the left or right of that stand (because there’s no cable management or even a groove). My Ikea desk is small enough I actually have to place my speakers &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; the TV and make sure nothing (not even my water bottle) stands between me and the TV to avoid blocking my view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="f53Act"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10913533"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3jDDOv"&gt;I’m getting used to it, but even a simpler four-legged stand &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22135602%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like the one LG ships with its cheaper LG A1&lt;/a&gt; would make things a good bit easier. Maybe don’t buy that one for PC gaming, though; it tops out at 60Hz. I could put my PC on the floor and clean it often, I suppose, or drill a wall stud and find a mount strong enough to hold up a 42-pound TV or a 32-pound monitor, but that’s not an option for every buyer. (They both technically work with VESA monitor arms if you have one strong enough; the Neo G9 has a 100x100 pattern with M4 screws, the C1 48 is 300x200 with M6 screws instead.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzTYap"&gt;You may want to find room for LG’s TV remote, too, because there’s no nub to easily navigate an on-screen display with the LG, just a single button under the manufacturer logo to turn it on and off and cycle through inputs. Meanwhile, the Samsung not only has serious cable management and easy OSD navigation but also an adjustable stand, a built-in USB 3 hub, and a remarkably capable picture-by-picture mode that lets you connect two computers or a computer and a modern game console simultaneously. They can each run at 120Hz on their own virtual 27-inch screens, and it comes with three programmable buttons to swap between entire sets of user-customized settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MxXlH"&gt;I’m a little sad that neither the LG nor Samsung is ready to claim the title of the ultimate PC monitor because we’re tantalizingly close. Samsung needs quality control and maybe partnerships to reboot &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6NbyEmPalA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;multi-projection game development&lt;/a&gt;; LG’s gotta build a burn-in protection algorithm that doesn’t make me want to claw my eyes out. Having these gigantic screens on my desk feels like the future, and I badly want both companies to do a lot more focused testing with gamers to perfect their products for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s6YwVI"&gt;I have high hopes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640058/lg-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-delayed-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s upcoming 42-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt;, but I wonder if it’s time for the company to build a true OLED PC gaming monitor as well. Maybe it could even take a page from Samsung and make it a super curved screen; I hear great things about &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Floc38bn95cw.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeLGvSamsungOdysseyReview121021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 38-inch 3840 x 1600 curved ultrawide&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s pricey and not OLED. I suppose the great GPU shortage means there’s time for these companies to figure it out: I used an RTX 3080 to competently drive these screens’ 7 or 8 million pixels across the latest games, and that kind of card will likely be in short supply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;throughout 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
