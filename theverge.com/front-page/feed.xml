    <title>The Nikon Z9’s new sensor could be the start of a big shift in photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/na8o3ezZK2iyEyZun5OTW9ohOI0=/27x0:1143x744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067206/nikon_z9_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikon’s Z9 pro mirrorless camera has no mechanical shutter, relying solely on an electronic shutter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nikon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Manxm0"&gt;Nikon recently &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/about-nikon/press-room/press-release/kv76k47t/THE-NIKON-Z-9%3A-UNSTOPPABLE-PERFORMANCE,-REVOLUTIONARY-INNOVATION.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its new flagship camera, the &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-Overview"&gt;Z9&lt;/a&gt;. This camera represents Nikon’s first mirrorless camera fully geared towards professional photographers and hybrid shooters, with &lt;a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/mirrorless-cameras/z-9.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-TechSpecs"&gt;a huge spec list&lt;/a&gt; designed for use in the demanding fields of photojournalism, sports, nature, birding, and any other use-cases that call for a camera that shoots incredibly fast at high resolution. The $5,500 Z9 is also Nikon’s first camera to omit a traditional mechanical shutter, allowing it to achieve new levels of speed and autofocus performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBvwh0"&gt;Faster speed is great, especially for sports photographers. But it’s interesting to think about where this technology could be used to take traditional-style cameras in the future. This might be the first step towards larger format cameras adopting the computational smarts that smartphone cameras have been embracing for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thwisCJp5SqofODjOa32pCG3Chk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968281/Z9_24_70_2.8_tilt_monitor_H.high.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nikon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z9 features a multi-angle 3.2-inch LCD that can tilt in both orientations but cannot face forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vx7V7P"&gt;Nikon has made no mention of things like computational photography for HDR-style photos or the cyclical buffering that smartphones do to simultaneously capture up to nine or 10 frames and combine them with each press of the shutter button. But the new 45.7-megapixel full-frame backside-illuminated stacked CMOS sensor isn’t far off from what has been in phones for years, at least in terms of the core design. This kind of construction uses a sandwiched architecture of sensor, logic board, and dedicated RAM — yielding incredibly fast readout speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cir6RM"&gt;Today, that enables the Z9 to use a full-time electronic shutter with the fastest shutter speed of 1/32,000 of a second and achieve incredibly quick burst shooting. It can capture 20 frames per second in RAW / JPG at full resolution or as fast as 120fps at 11 megapixels, all without making any audible sounds (optional fake shutter sounds can be enabled for an audible cue). The new Expeed 7 processor and dual CFexpress / XQD card slots give the Z9 a claimed 1,000-shot buffer at full resolution in a high-efficiency compressed RAW, but it’s the fast readout speed of the stacked sensor that could be the key to the computational photography enigma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWqIkv"&gt;As the first of the major camera manufacturers to ditch the mechanical shutter, it puts Nikon ahead of its competitors in the race towards computational photography. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22545402/sony-alpha-1-a1-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price-features-test"&gt;Sony’s A1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20896423/sony-a9-ii-mirrorless-camera-announced-specs-price-release-date"&gt;A9&lt;/a&gt; lines have already utilized stacked sensors for fast readout speeds, making electronic shutters viable for full-time duty, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673196/canon-eos-r3-camera-price-specs-release-date-announced"&gt;Canon’s upcoming R3&lt;/a&gt; will use the same technology. Moving to a fully electronic shutter has been the logical next evolution for cameras, though the onus will be on Nikon to prove its electronic shutter is up to the everyday tasks and demands for pro photographers right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q4NcXAyRngRBKYOyngxx0nMBvwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968303/nikonZ9_dualstream.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Nikon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z9’s stacked CMOS sensor is fast enough for blackout-free shooting while writing images to the card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JBYRqT"&gt;To date, efforts from camera manufacturers to implement computational photography have been limited to features like Olympus’s &lt;a href="https://learnandsupport.getolympus.com/learn-center/photography-tips/settings/when-to-use-the-internal-live-nd-filter"&gt;Live ND&lt;/a&gt; and Panasonic’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.panasonic.com%2Fglobal%2Fconsumer%2Flumix%2Ftechnologies%2Fpost_focus.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fphotography%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22751514%2Fnikon-z9-sensor-tech-full-frame-mirrorless-computational-photography-announcement-future-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post-focus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.panasonic.com%2Fuk%2Fconsumer%2Fcameras-camcorders%2Flumix-expert-advice-learn%2Flumix-expert-advice%2Fin-camera-focus-stacking.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fphotography%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22751514%2Fnikon-z9-sensor-tech-full-frame-mirrorless-computational-photography-announcement-future-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in-camera focus stacking&lt;/a&gt;. Handy features, yes, but these are sideshows compared to the paradigm shift that full computational photography implemented with every press of the shutter could one day be. OM System, the newly rebranded Olympus, &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/7896781388/olympus-is-now-om-system-and-has-a-new-micro-four-thirds-camera-on-the-way"&gt;recently promised&lt;/a&gt; to utilize computational photography technology in its next camera, but we will have to see if that’s the main focus or just another feature on the side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoVNJg"&gt;Deep Learning, which is used in the new Z9’s object detection autofocus system, has also been used to some capacity prior by Olympus, Panasonic, and Canon. It serves to improve autofocus tracking performance, but in the end, a mirrorless camera still captures a single image that is limited by the dynamic range of the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyqPOg"&gt;The primary barrier most likely preventing cameras like the Z9 and other pro- or enthusiast-level mirrorless cameras with stacked sensors going fully computational might lie in the data throughput and image processing pipeline. Ten frames captured simultaneously from a 45-megapixel full-frame sensor and combined into one file will be exponentially larger than the same collection of images taken from a smartphone sensor at a fraction of the size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3liTX"&gt;Additionally, cyclical buffering is necessary to be constantly writing and rewriting images to the camera’s buffer in the background before you press the shutter. Even the Z9’s new processor might not be up to these tasks. In the smartphone space, CPUs are designed to be well-suited for this processing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/5/16973286/google-pixel-visual-core-pixel-2-app"&gt;even sometimes using dedicated hardware&lt;/a&gt;, but cameras are not built the same way. It’s possible more innovation at the CPU level is still needed from the camera manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QqgfBzQQ8SU110tst4xIs3qZ-ak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968322/autofocus_expeed_7.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nikon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Processing power may be the last technological hurdle to computational photography in full-size cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fhP1zK"&gt;There are some obvious advantages to using computational photography. Most any modern smartphone can create a balanced exposure with subjects nicely lit, shadows full of visible detail, and clouds visible — all in the same frame. Advancements like Night Sight and Night Modes let you do things that are much harder to achieve with a standard camera, while Google continues to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;new computational tricks to keep subjects sharp when in motion&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple even allows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;RAW files with computational data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4hc8H"&gt;On the other hand, a photo taken with even the most advanced mirrorless camera today —while superior in sharpness and resolution — results in some sacrifice to be made, such as blowing out the highlights or crushing the shadow details in high-contrast daytime scenes. Achieving the same look as most smartphones requires at least a bit of post-processing and editing, ideally from a RAW file that must be exported as a JPG or other universal format. Computational photography coming to dedicated camera systems could re-energize the camera market, though it might also take camera manufacturers finally figuring out connected Wi-Fi apps that are not terrible — admittedly, another tall order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Lx5D"&gt;Cameras like the Z9 may be the bridge to that pathway, something that might be appreciated by even professional photographers who could spend less time editing to achieve the look many of their clients seek. It might just make full-size cameras a bit more exciting again, even if it may also further blur the lines of “what is a picture?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox has been down for more than a day and it’s not because of Chipotle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, the Roblox app seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Z93R08Jhhr70ewtLc6sU5fOvY8=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067162/1232025961.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akdtjY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has been down for more than a day, with the game and its related website offline for millions of players. The hugely popular game-creating platform first started having issues more than 30 hours ago, at 7PM ET on October 28th. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; said it was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454105518197280770"&gt;working hard to get things back to normal&lt;/a&gt;,” and that it has identified “the root cause as [an] internal system issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52cBFC"&gt;It’s not clear exactly why &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is still down, but some players have been speculating the outage could be related to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chipotle-to-open-virtual-restaurant-on-roblox-with-1-million-in-free-burritos-and-serve-up-5-digital-entree-offer-for-boorito-301408455.html"&gt;Chipotle promotion&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Chipotle is giving away $1 million worth of free burritos on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; as part of Halloween event in the game. The experience went live at 6:30PM ET on October 28th, just before the widespread &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lnWjOW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Still making progress on today’s outage. We’ll continue to keep you updated. Once again, we apologize for the delay.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know that this outage was not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;— Roblox (@Roblox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgQnb4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was quick to claim it’s not related to the Chipotle promotion, though. “We know that this outage was not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249"&gt;says the official &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5kGUP"&gt;It’s a surprisingly long outage for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, with players still waiting to hear more information on when the game will return and why it has been offline for so long. The main &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; site is offline in a maintenance mode, and the &lt;a href="https://status.roblox.com/pages/incident/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d/617b33af51fec9053d6122a1"&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t been updated for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz5uDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is very popular, especially with kids — &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1949710/roblox-is-getting-kids-attention-next-stop-an-ipo/"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players are under the age of 13. More than 40 million people playing it daily, and its popularity surged through 2020 during the pandemic. Millions of people have flocked to the game-creating game, app, platform, or however you want to describe it, to play games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;attend gigs&lt;/a&gt;, and even appear at awards shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook puts tighter restrictions on vaccine misinformation targeted at children</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tErT3YpioX0ex6ddW-GuHYOg1D8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067061/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zcva3F"&gt;Just as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22734765/fda-covid-vaccine-5-11-year-old-approve"&gt;the FDA officially approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for kids&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of five and 11, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta, Facebook’s brand new identity&lt;/a&gt;, announced that it’s rolling out stricter policies for vaccine misinformation targeted at children (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-kids-074628334.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;previously put restrictions on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020, but didn’t have policies specific to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmqQSZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/supporting-covid-19-vaccine-children/"&gt;Meta says in a new blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to take down harmful content related to children and the COVID-19 vaccine. This includes any posts that imply the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe, untested, or ineffective for children. Additionally, Meta will provide in-feed reminders in English and Spanish that the vaccine has been approved for kids, and will also provide information about where it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook vaccine notification" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7w3DW4ppX7VLid6dny7cE3AU6Ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22969112/facebook_vaccine_for_kids.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YzCE8W"&gt;Meta notes that it’s taken down a total of 20 million pieces of COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation from both Facebook and Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. These numbers are at odds with what we’ve seen from the leaked internal documents from Facebook — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;the Facebook Papers made it clear just how unprepared the platform was&lt;/a&gt; for misinformation related to the COVID-19 vaccine. If Facebook were more prepared, it might’ve rolled out campaigns to combat misinformation earlier in the pandemic, both for children and adults, possibly removing more false content as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global climate talks in Glasgow aren’t very global</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cop26 - Glasgow protest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj9WIlaUI3V-54MITclDhpRsvL0=/0x63:3702x2531/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067026/1236179798.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Climate activists “set fire” to George Square, Glasgow, with an art installation of faux flames, smoke, and banners, and giant fire extinguishers, creating a field of climate fire to welcome world leaders to Glasgow for the Cop26 conference.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBMn3J"&gt;One of the most anticipated rounds of international climate negotiations this decade will go down at a United Nations summit in Glasgow over the next couple weeks. But many representatives from the frontlines of the climate crisis won’t be there: people from islands that may be lost under rising seas, representatives of indigenous tribes, and activists who typically turn high-level negotiations into boisterous events with their demonstrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4SozB"&gt;The 26th annual United Nations Conference of Parties, or COP26, is the five-year anniversary of the Paris climate accords. Signatories, which included nearly every country on Earth, agreed to limit global warming to a level that might be manageable for humanity. Those nations are not close to meeting the goals to which they agreed. In a typical year, the summit also attracts thousands of people without badges to enter the conference grounds to push for certain policies. But this year, when Paris accord signatories have been asked to come with heightened ambitions, it will be harder for these activists to make themselves heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGL6yr"&gt;They won’t be coming mostly because of the pandemic, uneven vaccine rollout, and miles of red tape. Those who were able to get over those hurdles did so at enormous costs and anticipate more challenges on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YcG5qb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How will that affect a balanced and just outcome?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u06PLt"&gt;“How much can you actually reasonably negotiate when you’re exhausted, and when you feel something is unfair … And on top of that, you’re scared of getting COVID,” says Adrián Martinez, founder and director of the NGO La Ruta Del Clima based in Costa Rica. “How will that affect a balanced and just outcome?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TR18Qi"&gt;This year, many participants from vulnerable and developing nations want money to go to places that have already suffered permanent and irreparable damage because of climate change. Some populations in low-lying islands, like the &lt;a href="https://seors.unfccc.int/applications/seors/attachments/get_attachment?code=E08A4IBVOE450Z2EQXIPM1G3R3AO0OBM"&gt;Carteret Islands&lt;/a&gt; in Papua New Guinea, for instance, have already begun to abandon their homes. The battle to acknowledge loss and damage has ensued since Paris, and now advocates are continuing that fight with one arm tied behind their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM7AXT"&gt;A third of small island nations and territories in the Pacific, which are considered among the most vulnerable to rising sea levels that eat up low-lying land, won’t be sending any government officials to negotiate on their behalf, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/21/third-of-pacific-islands-unable-to-attend-cop26-sparking-fears-summit-will-be-less-ambitious"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. Instead, the countries will tap people from their missions in Europe or the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja0c2t"&gt;During the Paris negotiations, those nations &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglobeandmail.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Fsmall-island-states-make-waves-at-paris-climate-conference%2Farticle27742043%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22753391%2Fglasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fought to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a less ambitious 2 degrees that other countries preferred. That half-degree difference means &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/"&gt;40,000 fewer people&lt;/a&gt; around the world will have their land gobbled up by rising seas by 2150. In Paris, the small island nations won a sort of half-victory. The language in the agreement ended up committing countries to hold global average temperatures “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lES5hG"&gt;UK event organizers said that they would provide vaccines to delegates who needed them but didn’t begin offering first doses until about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/09/07/climate-glasgow-delay/"&gt;two months before the summit&lt;/a&gt;, which kicks off October 31. That didn’t leave much time to receive two-dose vaccinations or make travel plans that comply with the UK’s COVID-related restrictions. The UK required visitors from “red-listed” countries to quarantine in a hotel for up to 10 days upon arrival, a huge extra cost for many people traveling to the conference — up to $3,600 per person, according to Martinez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTxfTv"&gt;Last-minute changes — which were usually out of attendees’ control — saddled participants with higher bills. Martinez and his colleagues booked an Airbnb near the summit six months in advance. But weeks before the conference, the host doubled the price. They rushed to find somewhere else to stay and settled on lodging in Edinburgh — more than an hour’s drive from Glasgow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="oI1FW3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This will be the first time I’m going to set foot basically out of my house.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLcagf"&gt;Even with travel plans set, attendees are anxious. “This will be the first time I’m going to set foot basically out of my house. COVID has ravaged our country very badly. I’ve had personal losses,” says Tasneem Essop, executive director of the international Climate Action Network, who lives in South Africa. “For me, it’s a bit traumatic, you know, the thought of actually going and traveling to Glasgow and being part of this big event. But I am going.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWKSBj"&gt;All these added stressors ultimately sap energy from advocacy and negotiations at the summit, which often go around the clock. “All this disruption has, for sure, reduced a lot of the delegations from the Global South,” Martinez says. That means fewer subject matter experts to tackle certain priorities, according to Martinez, and delegates might not be able to take breaks by tapping each other in and out of lengthy negotiations. That creates an uneven playing field, he says, because wealthier nations will likely have the resources to vaccinate and fund larger delegations — which he fears might give them more influence during the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1hZgQ"&gt;The Climate Action Network and Greenpeace actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660795/activists-cop26-united-nations-climate-change-summit-glasgow"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; COP26 organizers last month to delay the summit. But after having already postponed the negotiations for a year because of the pandemic, summit organizers did not budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unJtpA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The structural silencing of thousands of people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PBjU3H"&gt;A coalition of environmental groups, called the COP26 Coalition, started a program this year to help potential attendees get their visas and fulfill requirements to participate in the summit. It had over 150 open cases. Of those, two-thirds of the people they sought to help ultimately decided not to attend. That’s probably just a small fraction of everyone who ended up falling through the cracks, according to Rachael Osgood, the lead immigration and international logistics coordinator for the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYIr0o"&gt;“This is the structural silencing of thousands of people. And those thousands speak on behalf of the most affected areas around the world,” Osgood says. “They represent millions. And for all those on the frontline of this crisis, who have little to no representation, this is a death sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minnesota man charged with illegally streaming MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA games for profit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBeeOSLnbf42HpOq9IREAc03ncI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70066995/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Feds say a Minnesota man illegally streamed major league sports games | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Gqi8p"&gt;Federal authorities have accused a Minnesota man with trying to extort $150,000 from Major League Baseball after hacking into its computer system. The US Attorney’s office for the southern district of New York and the FBI have charged Joshua Streit, 30, with illegally streaming content from MLB, as well as from the National Hockey League (NHL), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Football League (NFL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4Z57l"&gt;The law enforcement agencies &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/minnesota-man-charged-computer-intrusion-and-illegally-streaming-content-four-major"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; that between 2017 through August of 2021, Streit operated a website where he illegally streamed the sports leagues’ live games for profit. He gained unauthorized access to the leagues’ websites, and misappropriated login credentials from legitimate subscribers, according to authorities, and his scheme led to losses of about $3 million for one of the “victim sports leagues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pm6ba9"&gt;In addition, authorities said, Streit, also known as Joshua Brody, tried to extort the $150,000 from MLB, threatening to publicize the vulnerabilities on its site that he claimed to have exploited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Iyclg"&gt;“Streit initiated the extortion scheme at the same time that he was exploiting MLB’s computer systems to gain unauthorized access to copyright content that he streamed for profit,” the news release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plH84m"&gt;Streit faces five criminal counts including wire fraud, accessing a protected computer, illicit digital transmission, and sending interstate threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rh6u13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save on spooky games to play during Halloween and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_w9CdBp2uQg54BQL-eUIm3vSL84=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70066877/Deathloop_Shift_8637261279a70e6e756.01266203.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, Deathloop isn’t scary, but the deal on it is scary good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQivMw"&gt;It’s the spooky holiday this weekend, but you probably already knew that since Halloween decorations have likely been up in your town for the last month and a half. But what hasn’t been around as long (and will disappear faster than those decorations) are the deals below. To match the mood, we’re going to share special discounts on scary video games that you need to play if you’re trying to get in the holiday spirit this weekend. Just so you know, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"&gt;Steam’s Halloween sale&lt;/a&gt; ends Monday, November 1st, likely at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Following that gaming-centric section, you’ll find deals on tech gadgets that we think you’ll enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CNedqh"&gt;Gaming deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="02VKZg"&gt;Okay, so &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;is far from being a scary game at its core (though it can become &lt;em&gt;quite &lt;/em&gt;tense when you’re down to that last sliver of health and surrounded by enemies), but we’re highlighting it here anyway because it’s down to its lowest price yet on all platforms. If you’re on PS5, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NDYPWK7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;physical version&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/9c61b852-c782-42e6-826e-b295fc482030/1"&gt;digital version&lt;/a&gt; each cost $40 (normally $60). For those who’ve been reluctant to jump into the game, this price should make it a little easier to justify. It’s also available on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252330/DEATHLOOP/"&gt;Steam for $40&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tj0Dii"&gt;This is Arkane Studios’ latest game, and its fast, frenetic action feels reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt;. The gameplay loop is much different, though, even if some of the powers you’ll eventually acquire are similar. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;Check out Andrew Webster’s full review of the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iXgOSO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835147"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Resident Evil 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95iJPAbM2c0HFNglINnhRN6yQy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13705899/RE2_Dec_Screen_08_png_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IUQJYm"&gt;Capcom’s remake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a stellar reimagining of the classic horror game, not to mention one of the company’s most polished games to date. Even if you didn’t play the original version on PS1, this game is a must-experience horror game that you can get for just $16 on &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA09193_00-BH2R000000000001"&gt;PS4 and PS5&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the same price for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2FRESIDENT-EVIL-2%2FBWMH951M3G3P&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22752472%2Fhalloween-spooky-games-deals-playstation-xbox-pc-steam-sale-deal-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/883710/Resident_Evil_2/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKiufAMQe72ZyM-9Lf18msoyfes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13078061/Review_Screen_2__EMBARGO_24AUG_.0.0.1440171482.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Mmsu"&gt;The choose-your-own-path slasher game &lt;em&gt;Until Dawn&lt;/em&gt; is just $10, and it’s a delightfully scary and campy experience. This one’s just for PlayStation 4 and 5 owners, and it’s already included in PS Now for consoles and &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-now/ps-now-on-pc/"&gt;on Windows PC&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re subscribed. The plot involves a bunch of teenagers (starring Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere) in a spooky house acting recklessly, with a killer on the loose. Your actions dictate the flow of the game, and it’s good fun &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00359_00-UNTILDAWN0000001"&gt;that’s well worth $10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Outer Wilds Echoes of the Eye" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AimJCnsaAJXOsEfAUTG4MT-NfwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885369/outerwildseote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mobius Digital / Annapurna Interactive&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KOupSF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; is another game that’s discounted for Halloween, and another title that, while not labeled as a horror game, has some spooky vibes to deliver the more you dig into it. There are no jump scares, though. Instead, the game has a few moments that’ll make you feel like you’re in an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Twilight Zone&lt;/em&gt;. Normally $25, it’s $15 on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/"&gt;PC via Steam&lt;/a&gt;. You can get its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698855/outer-wilds-echoes-of-the-eye-expansion-review"&gt;excellent &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; expansion &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=outer+wilds"&gt;for $12&lt;/a&gt; instead of $15, while you’re at it. The game is available on PlayStation consoles and Xbox consoles, but it isn’t currently discounted. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Inside" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFexMO1Qlx6VjyweDmBe2gu-7Nw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6716659/INSIDE_03.0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fUK2SO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a side-scrolling horror game from the makers of &lt;em&gt;Limbo &lt;/em&gt;that, unfortunately, is still in my backlog, but maybe I’ll play through it this weekend. It earned a spot in this roundup because I’ve heard that its ending really delivers on existential dread, which is just the thing I usually find myself running low on these days. It’s just $5 on the &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2054-CUSA05297_00-INSIDE0000000000"&gt;PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/INSIDE/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Soma Game" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tc1vlfqZikKRC-86RVT9CsFLnnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4080800/Screen_Screenshot_016.0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XAqQJ5"&gt;If you’re into sci-fi horror, you need to play &lt;em&gt;Soma&lt;/em&gt;, from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Amnesia&lt;/em&gt;. That pedigree alone should give you an idea of what you’re in for here: excellent environmental storytelling, haunting audio design, and a pretty good story about the future of humanity and AI. It’s just $4.50 for &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1192-CUSA03333_00-HPL3SOMAGAME2015"&gt;PlayStation consoles&lt;/a&gt; and PC via &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the games on this list, I think you’ll get the most scare per dollar with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hunt: Showdown" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZhMZkg7wulCLOeCOcRnp-wDSkCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967448/huntshowdown.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Crytek&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rXI4JZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunt: Showdown&lt;/em&gt; is a first-person multiplayer game with a unique blend of PvE and PvP elements. It’s a gorgeous-looking title with great sound design that you’ll need to pay attention to in order to get ahead. Once you’re over the somewhat steep learning curve, you and some friends might have a really good time with this one. Crytek is constantly updating the game, especially on PC, but the console versions seem to be well-designed, too (though the game doesn’t offer cross-platform play). It’s $20 for the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown/"&gt;game on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, $16 for &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4291-CUSA15760_00-HUNTSHOWDOWN0000"&gt;PlayStation consoles&lt;/a&gt;, or $16.49 for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2FHunt-Showdown-Deluxe-Edition%2F9NMJ9NQ3V2RZ&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F30%2F22752472%2Fhalloween-spooky-games-deals-playstation-xbox-pc-steam-sale-deal-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deluxe edition on Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIGkgs"&gt;Tech deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_3lXCawxfwL36_YUwytskO9Gj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18321337/akrales_190716_3546_0060.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LqKXZK"&gt;Okay, sharp left turn to mention some great tech deals. Bose is offering a $100 discount on like-new, refurbished sets of its Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Normally $379, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556694?sid=VergeHalloweenGames102921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bose.com%2Fen_us%2Fproducts%2Fheadphones_outlet%2Fnoise-cancelling-headphones-700-fr.html%23v%3Dnoise_cancelling_headphones_700_fr_black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re $279&lt;/a&gt;, with a few color options available. We don’t recommend just any refurbished products, just the ones where we’d personally feel comfortable accepting the risk of buying it. Thankfully, Bose says that these headphones may “occasionally have minor, nearly imperceptible blemishes.” They have a one-year warranty, a 90-day money-back trial period with free shipping and free returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHQcPb"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch reviewed these in 2019, and compared to the competition at the time, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 excelled with voice calls, in addition to a comfortable fit and great noise cancellation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review if you want some more context on the product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor 50 review: lose a Huawei, gain a Google</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Google’s software makes the Honor 50 a contender rather than competitive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kUBDaT"&gt;It’s rare that you need to get into geopolitics at the outset of a smartphone review, but it’s impossible to avoid with the Honor 50. It’s the first Honor-branded device to release outside of China since the brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;spun out from parent company Huawei last year&lt;/a&gt;. It means that despite Huawei’s continued presence on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, Honor is now able to include Google’s apps and services on a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bho8iK"&gt;Having access to these services, which include critical parts of the Android ecosystem like Google Play in addition to apps like Google Maps and YouTube, means that the Honor 50 is the first Honor phone in years to actually have a shot at being a viable purchase for customers outside of China. Its midrange starting price of €529 (about $616) doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVw4Hm"&gt;But while leaving its former parent company has opened a Google-shaped window for Honor, it’s also closed a Huawei-shaped door. Honor is now on its own, without the backing of one of the most well-resourced technology companies in the world. As a result, while not a bad phone, the Honor 50 ends up not feeling competitive with other handsets in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhIbgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1usZ"&gt;The Honor 50 starts at €529 (around $616) for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which is the version I’ve been using, but stepping up to €599 (about $698) gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Regardless of which option you go for, you get the same Snapdragon 778G processor and a 4,300mAh battery that can be fast charged at up to 66W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC0vPA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You get the choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NjxZsU"&gt;Honor’s phones have always been available with loud designs, and the Honor 50 is no different. My model came in a shiny white colorway, with the letters “HONOR” tiled across its back, and there’s also a garish sparkly silver color option available alongside more conventional black and green options. While I don’t love the color options, I think Honor deserves credit for its approach to the dual-ring camera bump on the Honor 50, which is a lot more interesting than the generic rectangles found on the backs of most devices (Huawei’s Nova 9 uses a very similar design, which Honor says is because the design was developed before the split).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVMwc7"&gt;Around front, the Honor 50 has a 6.57-inch 1080p OLED display, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a small centrally orientated hole-punch notch for the phone’s 32-megapixel selfie camera, which moderately curves around the left and right edges of the phone. I can’t fault the screen’s rich blacks or vibrant colors, and the under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive. If you don’t like curved displays, then you won’t like the Honor 50’s, but at least the phone doesn’t suffer from any palm-rejection issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t82WZd3sISbJxPFlNaKC4jF-PuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963228/jporter_211025_4826_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A curved screen might not be to everyone’s tastes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d-r-IsZluIIa_rXonBd_Y9D03Ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963226/jporter_211025_4826_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like the camera bump more than the color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y7l4aF"&gt;The Honor 50’s screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes it feel fast to use and smooth to look at, and the Snapdragon 778G processor happily keeps up, even while the screen quickly scrolling through visually intensive apps like Twitter. I had no problems with performance during my time with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjJhn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no IP-rating and no wireless charging&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TggGOl"&gt;The rest of the specs are more basic. There’s no IP rating for dust and water resistance and no wireless charging, and when it comes to audio, the phone outputs sound from a basic downward-firing speaker. It’s loud enough for listening around the house, but you’ll be reaching for a pair of headphones in noisier environments. Honor includes a pair of USB-C headphones in the box, which is fairly unusual these days, and almost makes up for the lack of a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulJlYu"&gt;Honor’s Magic UI software, which runs atop of Android 11 on the Honor 50, is broadly inoffensive. However, it has its annoyances and, by default, is set up in a way that I think most people are going to want to tweak. For starters, it uses Microsoft’s SwiftKey rather than Google’s Gboard keyboard that I think most Android users will be more familiar with. There are also a ton of stock Honor apps that I disabled in my first couple of days with the phone, and I don’t love the way Honor’s software defaults to eschewing Android’s typical app drawer for an iOS-like homescreen. It’s easy enough to rectify with some tweaks, but it feels a little cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eq6YfkE9SHvOAV1u0qIM91qD_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963224/jporter_211025_4826_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has four rear cameras in its camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsf43s"&gt;I had no complaints with the battery life of the Honor 50, averaging a little over seven hours of screen on time between charges. I never had to put the phone on to charge at the end of the day with less than 40 percent charge remaining. The Honor 50 supports 66W fast charging via an included charger that’s branded as Honor’s own “SuperCharge” charging standard, which isn’t compatible with third-party chargers. Honor claims the included charger can get the phone from 0 to 100 percent charge in 45 minutes (unfortunately, my review sample came with an EU plug, so I was unable to verify this claim myself). But a full charge in under an hour is nothing to be sniffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S043nr"&gt;The headline camera specs of the Honor 50 appear to be impressive at first glance, but the devil’s in the detail. Yes, it’s a 108-megapixel quad-camera array, but there’s no telephoto camera, and beyond the main sensor, the three additional cameras are a comparatively low-resolution 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5rzBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10834528"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH69Sq"&gt;Things don’t get off to a great start with the Honor 50’s main camera. Even in daylight, there can be a distinct lack of detail in its shots, like in the shot of the black cat above, where there’s very little definition or texture in its fur. Colors are vibrant at the risk of being a little oversaturated, and faces come out looking a little too bright and textureless. White balance is at least pretty natural, and I think selfies come out generally looking OK, helped by the fact that there’s an easily accessible shortcut to turn on background blurring and a beauty mode slider (if that’s a feature you’re interested in). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caOsnn"&gt;Low light performance leaves a lot to be desired, where the Honor 50 produces shots that are dark and muddy. But the bigger problem is that the phone takes way too long to take photographs in low light. When trying to take a shot of a group of people at a party, the Honor 50 refused to take a photo for several agonizing moments, which is far longer than people at a party are willing to wait to have their photo taken for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVLEUhGmjx-P5x--gjLjWPl3NmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963229/jporter_211025_4826_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C and bottom-firing speaker, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/648NqA0oDE6Rqeo032kNax-Cqm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963225/jporter_211025_4826_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 120Hz display is hard to fault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9VgiQb"&gt;At its starting price, the Honor 50 is a comfortably midrange device. But there are a lot of accomplished smartphones available at similar prices. Phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€499 for its step-up 12GB RAM / 256GB storage model) or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for its 128GB storage variant) are both excellent phones that offer a much more rounded experience than the Honor 50. And if you’re considering the Honor 50 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, then you’re just €50 away from the recently announced Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFEUIv"&gt;It’s a crowded part of the market, and simply having access to Google’s apps and services isn’t enough to make an impact. Honor’s software can feel bloated, and its camera is sluggish and lacking in detail. Speedy 66W fast charging and a slick 120Hz display aren’t enough to distract from the fact that the Honor 50 has some weak spots when compared against the best midrange handsets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jX6wqK"&gt;Honor might be a viable purchase now that it can once again include Google’s apps and services on its devices. But it has more work to do if it wants to be truly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VegvPD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>These might be the first leaked photos of Intel’s Arc Alchemist graphics card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kIrpDSn-HCtZmLEogZDIPE1E-HI=/250x0:2268x1345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065416/Intel_Arc_Alchemist_DG2_512EU_Reference_Card.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zy1KA7"&gt;Intel is building dedicated gaming graphics cards, due out in Q1 2022, and we may have just gotten our first look at the big one, the Arc Alchemist. Here are some leaked images from YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD7s1ZFLoO4"&gt;Moore’s Law is Dead&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-alchemist-flagship-desktop-graphics-card-has-been-pictured"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Videocardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9kKZnIg2tGgalgPXsgStVXRGLag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968221/Intel_Arc_Alchemist_DG2_512EU_Reference_Card_back.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5SdZrqSjsQQFmsWBpnGibwcqV4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968220/Intel_Arc_Alchemist_DG2_512EU_Reference_Card.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Kgk6xc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;Arc is Intel’s new GPU brand&lt;/a&gt;, designed to compete with Nvidia GeForce and AMD Radeon, and the Arc Alchemist is the first GPU in the company’s roadmap that’s actually scheduled to release. The company had previously built &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058422/intel-dg1-discrete-gpu-graphics-card-announcement-ces-2020"&gt;the Intel DG1&lt;/a&gt; to test the GPU waters, but that was a comparatively weak card, based on the Xe LP (low-power) graphics architecture, and consumers couldn’t actually buy it. This new card is part of Intel’s Xe HPG roadmap (high-power / gaming) and is said to deliver performance akin to an Nvidia RTX 3070 thanks to 512 execution units (EUs) and 16GB of GDDR6 memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNMsUy"&gt;Leaks suggest that Intel may also have several variants of its “DG2” GPU in the works, including lighter versions with 448EUs, 384EUs, 256EUs or as few as 128EUs for an entry level GPU. Even that would be notably more than the number of graphics core clusters that Intel has typically integrated into its own CPUs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is officially closing its Redwood City and Toronto offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B-_zegsYlSpgdeKWjkbt066v9S4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70065346/acastro_190530_1777_nintendo_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="buKWZ9"&gt;Nintendo is closing its Redwood City, California and Toronto, Canada offices, the company confirmed in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-nintendo-shutters-california-office-1847966405"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the closure of the Redwood City offices earlier on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwqDdv"&gt;Here is the company’s full statement on the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eHs3Ig"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo of America headquarters are in Redmond, WA, and Vancouver, BC. We are moving more of our employees and operations into those headquarters and will be closing small satellite offices in Toronto, ON, and Redwood City, CA, over time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTfvZk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devon Pritchard, Executive Vice President, Business Affairs and Publisher Relations for Nintendo of America (NOA), will assume interim leadership of Sales, Marketing and Communications following the departure of Nick Chavez. Ms. Pritchard will oversee strategy and execution of sales, marketing and communications across the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KQuJJT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reports that about 100 employees have been displaced in the Redwood City offices as a result of the decision. Nintendo declined to comment when we asked how many employees would be affected by the move, but its statement above does suggest some employees will be able to relocate. It’s not clear why the offices are being closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZncHV"&gt;The Redwood City office is still shown on a map of Nintendo’s office locations on &lt;a href="https://careers.nintendo.com/about-us/"&gt;the company’s jobs website&lt;/a&gt;. “Here you’ll find the Sales and Marketing departments, as well as NMI, a dedicated merchandising field team who work with retail stores across the country,” a description reads. The Toronto office is also still on the site, described as a “sales office for NOCL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFjxY1"&gt;As of earlier today, there were &lt;a href="https://careers.nintendo.com/job-openings/"&gt;no open positions listed&lt;/a&gt; for the Redwood City location, even the company appears to have had an open role for a “Specialist, Experiential Marketing” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS968US968&amp;amp;ei=H258YYupMpy90PEP5daBgA4&amp;amp;oq=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjoHCAAQRxCwAzoECAAQQzoKCC4QxwEQ0QMQQzoFCAAQkQI6CwguEIAEELEDEIMBOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOhAILhCxAxCDARDHARDRAxBDOgcIABCxAxBDOggILhCABBCxAzoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6EQguEIAEELEDEIMBEMcBENEDOggIABCABBCxAzoICAAQsQMQkQI6CwgAELEDEIMBEJECOgUIABCABDoICAAQgAQQyQM6CAgAEMkDEMQCOgYIABAWEB46DggAEIAEELEDEIMBEMkDSgQIQRgAUOOpDVjs3w1gmuENaAFwAngAgAGXAYgB2ReSAQQyNy42mAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;ibp=htl;jobs&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUg_Cmz_DzAhWGHjQIHeLDB9MQkd0GegQIKhAB#fpstate=tldetail&amp;amp;htivrt=jobs&amp;amp;htiq=nintendo+job+opening+redwood+city&amp;amp;htidocid=1i0BSar28w0cW3CrAAAAAA%3D%3D"&gt;as recently as two days ago&lt;/a&gt;, according to Google caches.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redwood City doesn’t have any open roles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNTtXP"&gt;Given that the Redwood City office was focused on sales, marketing, and merchandising, it likely won’t affect the development of Nintendo’s games or hardware. Most of Nintendo’s games are developed overseas, though it also has developer Retro Studios in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3YILG"&gt;The closure comes just weeks after the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;Nintendo Switch with an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of Nintendo’s biggest games of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitness app Supernatural is becoming part of Meta after Facebook touts VR fitness</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Supernatural&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Szd8Vn"&gt;Meta &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwithin-to-join-meta%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that the studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746070/supernatural-vr-workout-app-adds-boxing-oculus-quest"&gt;VR workout game Supernatural&lt;/a&gt; will be joining the company, adding to the roster of studios owned by what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;used to be known as&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s Oculus division. The company says that Within, the company behind Supernatural, will continue to work on the popular fitness app and will also help Meta’s Reality Labs “enhance future hardware to support VR fitness apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QOwsz"&gt;Meta scooping up Within isn’t necessarily a surprise move: it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;spent the last few years&lt;/a&gt; acquiring tons of popular VR studios, like &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; devs Ready at Dawn, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;, and others working on projects that some have called the VR versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22530144/facebook-oculus-studios-acquires-bigbox-vr-population-one"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YtiwG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook cornering the VR market?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="nhazQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10833239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6GfxTu"&gt;Given Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749648/active-pack-oculus-quest-2-fitness-workouts-sweat-hygiene"&gt;focus on its headsets as workout tools&lt;/a&gt; (Supernatural even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOn2CZWnxxY"&gt;got a callout&lt;/a&gt; in its Connect keynote on Thursday), it tracks that Zuckerberg’s company would want to add a popular VR fitness game to its roster. The move, however, doesn’t help with concerns that Meta is going to end up owning the entire virtual reality market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kx1Qeg"&gt;While Supernatural&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is Within’s flagship app, &lt;a href="https://www.with.in/about"&gt;according to the company’s site&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also been the host of VR experiences, too — in 2016, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12253358/mr-robot-virtual-reality-elliot-flashback-story-sdcc-2016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Robot &lt;/em&gt;VR episode&lt;/a&gt; (executive produced by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;Within founder Chris Milk&lt;/a&gt;) was shown on the app, and the company’s website contains dozens of documentaries, music videos, and more. That streaming tech and library of content isn’t a bad get either for a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;trying to build a metaverse&lt;/a&gt; where people hang out and watch content together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PT9rVm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best thing to do in VR is work out","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
