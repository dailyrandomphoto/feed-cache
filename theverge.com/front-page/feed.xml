    <title>Anker unveils $129 Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro wireless earbuds with ANC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3siE4PBSh7bwlkj9Q5Ik8B9eaLk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656406/anker.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fdl75M"&gt;The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds are one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;best options in the budget category&lt;/a&gt;, and now the Anker brand has returned with a more advanced model. The Liberty Air 2 Pro buds are focused on sound quality and active noise cancellation (ANC), and like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/8/3/17645534/best-wireless-earbuds-airpods-jabra-samsung-sony-anker/comment/483871881"&gt;the larger Liberty 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; feature 11mm drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKqGU5"&gt;The new model has improved ANC with modes designed to fit various situations — the transport mode blocks out lower frequencies, for example, while the indoor mode is better at reducing mid-range sounds like voices in an office. There’s also a transparency mode with two levels of ambient sound enhancement, and Anker is touting “premium call quality” thanks to six-mic noise reduction tech. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UzhApFZfD8xHhzhvSNKi5IW1Rms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229805/A3951_Liberty_Air_2_Pro__Four_Up_Earbud_Colors.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cf3Ed8"&gt;Anker says the Liberty Air 2 Pro should get seven hours of battery life with ANC off, or six with it on. With the case fully charged, Anker is quoting 26 total hours of endurance with ANC off and 21 with it on, so you’re probably looking at getting three to four full recharges from the case depending on your usage. The case can be charged over USB-C or wirelessly with Qi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oPuer"&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro will be available in four colors (black, white, blue, and pink) and will go on sale today for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Call of Duty League’s second season will kick off in February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Call of Duty League - Launch Weekend" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_PCguPnqS8_iijr68z15zWp1Fc=/0x11:4350x2911/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656446/1196414800.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nB44IQ"&gt;The second season of the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League will begin play next month. Today, Activision Blizzard announced that the CDL regular season for 2021 will kick off with an opening event from February 11th–14th, though the actual schedule and matchups have yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvZTGU"&gt;The league debuted last year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21078871/call-of-duty-league-opening-weekend-esports-activision-blizzard"&gt;an ambitious plan to blend city-based teams with esports&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279107/overwatch-league-may-melee-tournament-structure-blizzard"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the pandemic, the CDL — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196237/esports-leagues-online-coronavirus-call-of-duty-overwatch-league-of-legends"&gt;along with most other competitive gaming leagues&lt;/a&gt; — was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177465/call-of-duty-league-cdl-overwatch-owl-online-games-esports-coronavirus"&gt;shift to an online format&lt;/a&gt;. The season culminated with a championship weekend in August where the Dallas Empire won &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;a literal throne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KDPC19"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Call of Duty League’s championship team will win this ridiculous throne","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"},{"title":"Nadeshot on getting back into Call of Duty with the Los Angeles Thieves","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552513/100-thieves-call-of-duty-league-cdl-la-nadeshot-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uyrlka"&gt;The 2021 season will introduce &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZ5tdr27aE"&gt;a few changes&lt;/a&gt;, including 4 vs. 4 gameplay and a shift to PC. There will also be a new team among the 12 CDL clubs: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;the Los Angeles Thieves&lt;/a&gt; will replace Optic Gaming Los Angeles. Like last year, all games will be broadcast exclusively on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzYP7s"&gt;While the season won’t start until next month, a preseason event will take place on January 23rd and 24th, where fans from the top three teams last year — Dallas, Atlanta, and Chicago — will be able to vote on who they play against.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft drivers in California sue to overturn Prop 22 ballot measure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-VOTE-IT-LIFESTYLE-TRANSPORT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-keCH0tReWirV0Yc88h_L9HZLII=/0x1:4257x2839/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656411/1229135526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZIkMA"&gt;A group of Uber and Lyft drivers in California filed a lawsuit Tuesday in state supreme court to overturn a ballot measure that allows the companies to continue treating its workers like independent contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdgKJv"&gt;The drivers claim that Prop 22, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;approved by California voters last November&lt;/a&gt;, violates the state’s constitution by “stripping” the state legislature’s ability to empower workers to organize, as well as by “illegally” excluding ride-hail drivers from the state workers’ compensation program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A064OL"&gt;“Every day, rideshare drivers like me struggle to make ends meet because companies like Uber and Lyft prioritize corporate profits over our wellbeing,” plaintiff Saori Okawa said in a statement. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;With Prop 22, they’re not just ignoring our health and safety — they’re discarding our state’s constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3otnM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With Prop 22, they’re not just ignoring our health and safety — they’re discarding our state’s constitution”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cGlb9Q"&gt;The drivers challenging the constitutionality of Prop 22 are being supported by labor unions like SEIU and the California Labor Federation, which unsuccessfully opposed the measure in the run-up to the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAJF25"&gt;But ultimately labor was outspent and outmaneuvered by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;which poured over $200 million&lt;/a&gt; into the “Yes on 22” campaign to exempt them from a California state law that would require them to treat their workers like employees. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549760/uber-lyft-prop-22-win-vote-app-message-notifications"&gt;The companies aggressively opposed the law&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it would eliminate driver flexibility, while also increasing consumer prices and wait times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFJkZy"&gt;The law, AB5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376009/uber-ceo-interivew-california-ab5-drivers-khosrowshahi"&gt;represented an existential crisis&lt;/a&gt; for the companies, none of which have ever turned a profit and which have pursued costly efforts to develop autonomous technology in the hopes of eventually replacing drivers and delivery workers entirely. In response, the companies proposed a ballot measure that would keep their workers as contractors, while also providing a modicum of added benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7az5l"&gt;It’s unclear how successful drivers will be in overturning Prop 22. The measure was written in a way to withstand future challenges, including a provision that requires a seven-eighths majority of the state legislature for any modification, and ensuring that it will be all but impossible to invalidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PJux0K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;drivers are trying to use this language to argue that Prop 22 was illegal from its inception&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yOYIW2"&gt;But drivers are trying to use this language to argue that Prop 22 was illegal from its inception. The plaintiffs note that California’s state constitution gives the legislature “unlimited” authority to provide for a worker’s compensation system, “so that authority cannot be limited by a statutory initiative.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VuAB2"&gt;“We look forward to the court affirming that gig companies cannot strip workers of their fundamental right to bargain for better pay and working conditions — and that corporations alone should not dictate the laws in our state,” said Bob Schoonover, president of SEIU Local 721 and SEIU California State Council, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKtMXJ"&gt;There have been ballot measures successfully repealed in California in the past, but mostly through additional ballot measures. If the lawsuit fails, drivers’ and supportive unions’ only other recourse to overturn Prop 22 may be another ballot initiative.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A30yc"&gt;Drivers are organizing car caravans in San Francisco and Los Angeles in support of the lawsuit against Prop 22. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD says RDNA 2 GPU-powered laptops will arrive in the first half of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6R84GFIUFpr-Y358uIDRfSmESbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656391/acastro_180529_1777_amd_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zY9Q4p"&gt;AMD says customers eager for a new gaming laptop should be able to buy the first RDNA 2 GPU-powered notebooks some time before July, the company revealed today during its CES 2021 press conference. RDNA 2 is AMD’s new graphics chip architecture and the foundation of the custom chipsets in Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series S / X, and now it’s coming to laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7NUB1"&gt;The Radeon RX 6000 series of GPUs were the first to feature AMD’s new RDNA 2 architecture when they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538010/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-specs-release-date-price-big-navi-gpu-graphics"&gt;unveiled in October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, but those were top-of-the-line desktop graphics cards designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s 3000 series line.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="whSNeb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AMD is on track to launch the first notebooks with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDNA2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RDNA2&lt;/a&gt; in the first half of 2021, and you'll see mainstream RDNA 2 desktop graphics card designs in the first half of the year as well. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CES2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EW2fBpSFDq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EW2fBpSFDq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Radeon RX (@Radeon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Radeon/status/1349031886853693441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9AM8p"&gt;Today at CES, AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company is “on track to launch the first notebooks with RDNA 2 in the first half of the year with our partners,” adding that “you’ll also see new mainstream RDNA 2 desktop graphic card designs in the first half of the year as well.” To showcase the performance of its mobile GPUs, Su showed off &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt; running at 1440p at 60 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3lIDH"&gt;That said, AMD is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;suffering from the same severe supply shortages&lt;/a&gt; Nvidia is right now, meaning it may be quite hard to get your hands on any of the new desktop designs if AMD does indeed hit that July deadline to deliver them. Although, perhaps laptops with those new mobile GPUs will be easier to get your hands by then if the desktop GPU shortage persists. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s 2021 Blade laptops are getting QHD screens and Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series graphics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DOgrcze4ZOk_G1N2VvDiBZrPGFo=/1x0:3652x2434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656280/blade15hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top-down view of the 2021 Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sc3q0E"&gt;Razer is bringing a heap of spec improvements to its 2021 lineup of Blade 15 and Pro 17 gaming laptops. The fit and finish of both models are largely the same as before — they are still ahead of the competition in terms of design — though I’m going to assume that they’re still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;total fingerprint magnets&lt;/a&gt;. However, the switch that I’m most excited about is that QHD screens are finally happening. You’ll be able to get a 1440p QHD display with a fast refresh rate and with Nvidia’s G-Sync variable refresh rate tech built in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpUWtr"&gt;Until recently, 1080p and 4K were the only options for displays on gaming laptops, despite 1440p being an increasingly popular choice among PC gamers looking for a new standalone monitor. This is the year that Razer and other manufacturers will make it an option — and it won’t cost you dearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gJC5ol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;QHD screens, new RTX graphics, and dual storage are the big takeaways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDbhtu"&gt;The higher-end Blade laptops will be equipped with Nvidia’s new RTX 3000-series graphics chips, and so should have an easy time running most games on a 1440p high refresh rate display. The Blade 15 Advanced (Razer’s name for the more powerful variant) with the RTX 3070 and a QHD screen with G-Sync will cost $2,499. You’ll be able to customize this model with up to a special variant of the RTX 3080 that has a whopping 16GB of VRAM. The bigger Blade Pro 17 will start at $2,299 and will feature the RTX 3060.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38a0Sh0fJbLpd5LtOBE6nOEIDVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227315/blade15shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design is unchanged, but it now supports Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series graphics chips, along with a QHD screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4ssLG"&gt;Razer is still using GTX 16-series chips for its more affordable Blade 15, which will start at $1,499 and will be equipped with the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti. It’s customizable with up to the RTX 3070 for $1,999. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;All models will be available for preorder starting today&lt;/a&gt; at Razer’s online store, with the base Blade 15 and the Blade Pro 17 arriving first on January 26th. The Blade 15 Advanced will ship in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJwyyN"&gt;The company is sticking with the 10th Gen Comet Lake Intel processors for this round of Blade laptops. Lower-cost configurations of the Blade 15 will offer the six-core 10750H. The Blade 15 Advanced and the Blade Pro 17 each feature the eight-core 10875H Comet Lake processor from Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5WT6iU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will this Blade 15 have better cooling than last year’s model?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Coo6fZ"&gt;All models will feature Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a newly added HDMI 2.1 output for 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second. These two ports aside, the I/O varies depending on the computer you get. The base Blade 15 models have an Ethernet port, while the Advanced variants do not. However, Razer makes up for it with a UHS-III SD card reader, Windows Hello IR webcam, 20V charging support via USB-C, and support for Bluetooth 5.2 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22212938/wifi-6e-rollout-starting-2021-smartphones-tvs-laptops-vr-routers"&gt;the new Wi-Fi 6&lt;/a&gt;. The Blade Pro 17 has all of the above features.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade Pro 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oyoqOw1D97CD1ICzONVuXnflqUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227316/blade17pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Razer Blade Pro 17, which is also configurable with a QHD display and RTX 3000-series graphics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VrlkiW"&gt;One other noteworthy change that Razer is making across the board is user-replaceable RAM and storage. Previously, only certain models had parts that could be serviced by the user. Additionally, Razer has added a second M.2 slot (up to 4TB of total storage across both slots) so you can simply add storage to what you already had instead of being forced to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aARft1"&gt;Okay, that was a lot. In case I’ve lost you with the spec dump, I’ve made a table that shows what each model offers and the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P0Lkl3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10268575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Acer’s latest Nitro 5 gaming laptop seems more powerful than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tkGzOLr_WNRzFy1dMs2gQDGEkgI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656276/nitro52021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer ditched a few of the red highlights seen on previous models for a more subdued look.&lt;/em&gt; | Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KmQOed"&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 gaming laptop has never been much of a technical or design showcase, but that’s changing a bit for 2021. It now has a slightly toned-down look that moves all of the red details (aside from the red backlit keyboard) to the rear part of the hinge. What’s more impressive, though, is that it’s getting big upgrades in the graphics, processing, and display departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrrkIT"&gt;For CES 2021, Acer announced that a 15.6-inch and 17-inch version of the Nitro 5 will release with support for the latest Intel 11th Gen Core H35-series processors or AMD’s Ryzen 5000-series CPUs (up to the Ryzen 9 5900 HX). They’ll all have the option to upgrade all the way up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 graphics chip either route you take with the processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEd5je"&gt;In terms of display quality, either size of the Nitro 5 can be configured with a 1440p display with a fast 165Hz refresh rate or a 1080p screen with a 360Hz refresh rate. If you get the Intel version with an 11th Gen CPU, the Nitro 5 will support Thunderbolt 4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRv9J08m7OYWK_sun18hE4GlIAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227514/nitro52nd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;mage: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nitro 5 will be available with 15.6-inch or 17-inch displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ70Be"&gt;You won’t have many options on launch day in February, though. In the US, Acer is starting with a single variant for $749.99 that has a 15.6-inch IPS display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the AMD Ryzen 5 5600H processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 graphics chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB NVMe SSD. It’s $100 more if you want the 17-inch version. There will also be models of the Nitro 5 available with 10th Gen Intel processors ahead of those built with 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mLw10"&gt;Acer hasn’t shared official US pricing for other configurations, but it did mention that models coming to other regions with AMD Radeon R7 graphics or the RTX 3060, with a 512GB NVMe SSD added in will cost €1,299. We’ll have to wait to see what the final price ends up being for the Nitro 5 with 11th Gen Intel processors and Nvidia’s high-end RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfrIQD"&gt;No matter which variant you might be interested in, Acer shared that each variant is user serviceable for memory and storage. By taking off the bottom cover of the Nitro 5, you’ll find support for two NVMe SSDs and one 2.5-inch SATA SSD (totaling three slots for expandable storage) and up to 32GB of RAM. Acer’s using Intel Wi-Fi 6 chips for all models, along with Killer-branded Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gigabyte announces new midrange gaming line powered by AMD’s Ryzen processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two Gigabyte G7 models perpendicular to each other. The front model is angled slightly backwards with the Gigabyte G7 logo displayed on the screen. The back is slightly closed." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAMc56dqW_3qCpavwLnOAH4DdiE=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656274/GIGABYTE_G7_VC_P0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Gigabyte G7 includes up to a 10th-Gen Intel Core i7. | Gigabyte&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fKEASy"&gt;Gigabyte makes some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best gaming- and creator-focused laptops&lt;/a&gt; you can get. But some of its most exciting 2021 releases aren’t its flagship models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQfnGO"&gt;Say hello to the new Gigabyte Gaming line, a slew of midrange gaming laptops aimed at younger consumers. “Gigabyte Gaming series target Gen Z and Millennial users, by offering up machines built for ‘multitasking’ and meeting multiple needs at once, whether it’s learning, commerce, gaming or content creation,” Gigabyte announced in its press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bf3C3H"&gt;The big news is that two of the new Gigabyte Gaming models, the A5 and the A7, are among Gigabyte’s first laptops to include AMD’s Ryzen mobile processors. Specifically, they’re outfitted with the brand-new Ryzen 5000H mobile series. They also include Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 3000 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmnE7Y"&gt;Starting at $999 and $1,399 respectively, the 15-inch A5 and 17-inch A7 seem positioned to compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell’s G5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo’s Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt;. The former, also powered by Ryzen, delivers excellent performance and not-horrendous battery life — &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewer Cameron Faulkner called it “incredibly capable for the price.” Since we haven’t yet gotten our hands on a Ryzen 5000H or GeForce RTX 3000 chip yet, we can’t yet say what kinds of performance gains you can expect from the A5 and A7 over those products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte G7 keyboard seen from above with orange backlighting." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eb9OzM5QpZRoow6t0haTKwU7UHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227862/GIGABYTE_G7_VC_P02.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colorful backlit keyboard on the Gigabyte G7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="impBJQ"&gt;Specs-wise, the laptops pair those chips with either a 144Hz or 240Hz display. And they adopt Gigabyte’s &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/275/home.html"&gt;Windforce&lt;/a&gt; cooling system, which includes “anti-turbulence inclined fans, ultra quiet PWM fan and pure copper heat pipe.” The result, Gigabyte says, will be “a sensational experience in both gaming and visual entertainment.” Both models include an SD card slot as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two Gigabyte G5 models perpendicular to each other. One facing the camera displays the Gigabyte G5 logo. The one facing away is slightly closed. Both display a backlit orange keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eMOJ38W-aQT6uKB3HWF1W9K2S8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227863/GIGABYTE_G5_VC_P0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the Gigabyte G5, also with a colorful keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4mCazp"&gt;One of Gigabyte’s most acclaimed midrange laptops of 2020 was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21201164/gigabyte-aorus-gaming-aero-creator-laptop-intel-10th-gen-core-i9-i7-processor-oled"&gt;Aorus 5&lt;/a&gt;. The 15-incher received strong reviews for its decent keyboard, good gaming performance, and neat design: “Its edgy aesthetic even looks a little dangerous,” wrote Katie Wickens of &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gigabyte-aorus-5-sb-gaming-laptop-performance-benchmarks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it had battery life issues, even for a gaming laptop — &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gigabyte-aorus-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only got an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIlK1D"&gt;However, that model was powered by the Intel Core i7-10750H, and battery life is one area where AMD’s Ryzen mobile processors tended to excel over Intel’s last year. If the Ryzen 5000 series continues that trend, the A5 and A7 could hopefully be an improvement in that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5wHEX"&gt;Intel fans, never fear. Gigabyte also announced the new G5 and G7, which are powered by 10th Gen Intel processors. The company writes: “From gig work to game time, the GIGABYTE G5 and G7 offers unrestricted performance made for more. More gaming, more production, more entertainment with reliability, power and speed, engineered ... to meet the new demands of the ‘new normal.’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte G5 angled away from the camera, half closed, with the Gigabyte logo visible." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pgnp8bejfoyGy6QgfRymtrYPBBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227876/GIGABYTE_G5_VC_P10.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gigabyte says the G5 is suitable for “casual gamers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpRGl"&gt;The G5 starts at $1,099; the G7 will not be available in the US. The A5 and A7 start at $999 and $1,399, respectively, and will be available around the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer announces AMD Ryzen-powered Aspire 5 and Aspire 7 laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person uses the Acer Aspire 7 at a cluttered table while drinking from a mug." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/baguhN58kT9CaBhEpei3ibbxLsw=/267x355:1734x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656275/Aspire7_A715_42G_High_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Aspire 7 in the wild.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E5RIKx"&gt;Acer’s Aspire 5 often receives high praise as one of the best budget laptops you can buy. But reviews were split this year — people liked the AMD model more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21815008/acer-aspire-5-review-2020-15-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Intel one&lt;/a&gt;. So I’m thrilled that the company is refreshing two Aspire models to feature AMD’s brand-new Ryzen 5000 Series mobile processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PERG12"&gt;The Aspire 7 pairs the Ryzen chip with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 GPU. That doesn’t make the Aspire a gaming laptop by any means, but it will allow for some light gaming and media work on the go. It weighs 4.73 pounds (2.15 kg) and can come with up to 32GB of DDR4 memory and 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. And it supports Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMCNbA"&gt;Acer also provides software to improve the viewing experience on the Aspire 7’s 15.6-inch FHD display. Per the company, Acer Color Intelligence and Acer ExaColor adjust gamma and saturation in real time to “deliver highly accurate visuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A person sits in a workspace cluttered with tech. They typeson the Acer Aspire 7 with their left hand whie holding a motherboard in their right hand." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dPMWXS2zZlWu29PzT-N0kU_VG4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229023/Aspire7_A715_42G_High_04.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish I enjoyed using anything as much as this person appears to enjoy using their Acer Aspire 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rsPlf"&gt;The Aspire 5 is even more solidly in the budget range; Acer says it’s targeted at amateur bloggers, photographers, and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BFqVn"&gt;The Aspire 5 swaps out the Nvidia chip for AMD’s entry-level Radeon RX 640 GPUs (also not recommended for tasks beyond basic gaming). You can also get up to 24GB of memory and 1TB M.2 PCIe SSD NVMe storage and / or a 2TB HDD. The 15.6-inch FHD IPS display includes Acer’s BlueLightShield technology, which is meant to reduce eye strain. Like its midrange sibling, this device also offers “superfast data transfer” (though Acer didn’t provide a specific speed) and supports dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two parents and a young child watch content on the Acer Aspire 5 in a bed. A dog paws one of the members." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58aKB1QG5hBzeJFMSYAgx6FId6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229027/Aspire5_A515_45__A515_45G__A515_45S_High_06.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a large screen and affordable price, the Aspire 5 can be a good choice for kids and families.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kixRE1"&gt;Both models also offer multiple cooling modes, meaning you can customize fan performance depending on the task you’re doing and how much sound you want to hear. This is a common feature of higher-end gaming and content-creation laptops. It means you can crank up the cooling when you’re doing your most demanding work without needing to hear the fans blasting 24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LKC2j"&gt;Both Aspire models are coming to North America in March. The Aspire 7 starts at $749.99, and the Aspire 5 starts at $549.99. Both will also be available in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa in February, while the Aspire 5 is coming to China this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gigabyte’s latest Aero and Aorus laptops include RTX 3080 and OLED options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two Gigabyte Aero 17 models sit perpendicular to each other on a white background. One faces the camera displaying the Aero 17 HDR logo on a green mosaic background. The other faces away from the camera and is slightly closed." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjX1ZOSfE9uCPMc-zTKcefBewc4=/0x577:3462x2885/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656281/AERO_17VC_P0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Get the Aero 17 HDR with up to an Intel Core i9. | Gigabyte&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ta5Ab8"&gt;Following Nvidia’s announcement of its RTX 3000 mobile series, Gigabyte has announced additions to its Aorus and Aero lines which will incorporate the new GPUs. Gigabyte says they’ll deliver “stunning ray-traced gaming experiences in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; and other AAA titles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61V1EO"&gt;Aorus laptops are traditional gaming laptops, while the Aero line targets content creators. The differences are largely external — Aorus products generally offer higher-refresh rate screens where Aero models opt for more color-accurate panels, and Aero laptops have a subdued and classy design while Aorus laptops look more like... gaming laptops. Inside, however, the chips are largely the same. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte Aero 15 OLED open against a white background with RGB keyboard illuminated. The screen displays the Aero logo on a green mosaic background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zdk_LEtgcri19vIxfRA_B2FKt7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229232/AERO15_OLED_s7_2304x1728_1_Mater_Image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aero 15 OLED maxes out at an RTX 3080 and a Core i9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YVUrui"&gt;The flagship of the Aorus line, the 17.3-inch Aorus 17G, is for “hardcore gamers” according to Gigabyte. The highlight is that it has a mechanical keyboard with exclusive Omron switches. It also includes a 300Hz screen, one of the fastest displays you can find on a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Aorus 15G open on a white background angled to the left. The Aorus 15G logo is displayed on the screen and the RGB keyboard is illuminated." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q7sn9Tng4IzmLGFD6wVqsmRue2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229248/AORUS_15G_P008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gigabyte says you’ll get eight hours of battery life from the Aorus 15G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yw8GWS"&gt;There are two new 15.6-inch models as well: the Aorus 15G and the Aorus 15P. Both come with a 240Hz FHD screen (which still shouldn’t be too much of a frame rate bottleneck in many modern games). The 15G is more portability-focused — Gigabyte says it delivers eight hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Exm8e4"&gt;All three Aorus models can be configured with up to an Intel Core i7 H-series processor; the two G models can go up to a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, while the 15P goes up to an RTX 3070. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Aorus 17G open on a white background with the RGB keyboard illuminated. The screen displays the Aorus 17G logo, an Xrite Pantone Certified badge in the bottom left corner, and an FHD 300Hz label in the bottom right corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yNqZROSMYE8E-duVk7U9BTrIOSw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229257/AORUS17G_s7_2304x1728_1_Mater_Image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aorus 17G looks like the Aorus 15G but bigger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BBXfzP"&gt;On the Aero side there are two new Aero 17 models (one with a 4K HDR panel and one with a regular FHD panel) and two new Aero 15 models (one with a 4K HDR AMOLED screen and one with a regular FHD panel). Gigabyte says the OLED configuration will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It’s also touting the Aeros’ connectivity — they support HDMI 2.1, MiniDP, Thunderbolt 3, and a UHS-II SD card reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5M8eM"&gt;Both the Aero 17 HDR and Aero 15 OLED include up to a GeForce RTX 3080 and an Intel Core i9. The Aero 17 maxes out at a GeForce RTX 3060 and a Core i7; the Aero 15 also stops at the Core i7 but can include an RTX 3070.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte Aero 17 facing away from the camera, angled slightly to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8I0dpit-Sn9gdk_-aEBL26nrzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229266/AERO_17VC_S009.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neat design on the lid of the Aero 17.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new Predator Triton 300 SE is an ultrapowerful, ultralight gaming laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WSsAWzNadvKfUYaeOccSMbJhbS0=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656271/predator.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7MTOR"&gt;Intel and Nvidia have both announced new PC parts that promise a new wave of ultralight gaming PCs with unheard of power. And Acer is already here to make those promises a reality with its new Predator Triton 300 SE gaming laptop, a 17.9mm thin, 3.75 pound gaming laptop that can be configured with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;Intel’s new 5GHz i7-11375H processor&lt;/a&gt; and Nvidia’s latest RTX 3060 GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNC4wV"&gt;But best of all? Acer is ditching the garish, colorful lights and logos on the Predator Triton 300 for a more restrained — dare I say, professional — all-metal design that wouldn’t be out of place in an office or a classroom, while still offering top-notch gaming hardware on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4nW9YaT9knUHsNoAyDehL33pEpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230394/Triton300_SE_PT314_51s_High_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6yMjpS"&gt;In addition to those high-end Intel chips and Nvidia GPUs, the Predator Triton 300 SE also offers a 14-inch FHD panel with a 144 Hz refresh rate and Thunderbolt 4, USB 3.2 Gen 2, and HDMI ports for connectivity. While it may offer the trappings of a work computer, there are still plenty of gaming PC touches, including a three-zone RGB keyboard, Intel’s Killer 6AX1650 Wi-Fi, and Acer’s Predator software suite for managing fan speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vP2hPg"&gt;The new Predator Triton 300 SE will start at $1,399.99 (although Acer has yet to say what specs you’ll get for that price) when it ships this February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STYYkr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
