    <title>Ozy Media shuts down just one week after most of us found out it exists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OZY FEST 2017 Presented By OZY.com" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWRQEnPX-JfxmcEHLOhVMBBaq3A=/598x104:3844x2268/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69939523/820963572.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lAtfvo"&gt;In the space of six days and five &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports from media columnist Ben Smith, Ozy Media has gone from a largely unknown content producer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/media/ozy-media.html?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;to closing its doors&lt;/a&gt;. The eight-year-old media startup was unrecognizable to most. That, despite a roster including some well-known journalists, the high-profile guests who appeared on CEO Carlos Watson’s show, or NYC subway riders who were occasionally inundated with advertisements for its Ozyfest event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dJWYsr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ozy Media acknowledged that its COO and co-founder pretended to be a YouTube executive on a conference call.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLdefT"&gt;If you don’t follow too many reporters on Twitter, you might not have heard, but last weekend the first &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/business/media/ozy-media-goldman-sachs.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report revealed two shocking things about Ozy Media. One, that co-founder and COO Samir Rao apparently tried to trick bankers from Goldman Sachs bankers on a conference call about a potential $40 million investment into believing that he was a YouTube executive extolling the virtues of Ozy Media’s video channel. Two, that after the deception was revealed, the leadership of Ozy Media blamed it on a mental health issue and allowed Rao to stay in his executive position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl17QC"&gt;Over the next few days, more of the stories told by Ozy Media and Watson started to unravel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnguNc"&gt;That includes pretty much any claim about its reach and traffic (a site claiming to have 25 million newsletter subscribers should be more well-known), and its claims to have reported on public figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) before other outlets. While those claims were echoed in reporting like this article on &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/ozy-revenue-profitability-carlos-watson-cdd726df-2e3d-49d7-abad-7ac6036f7013.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nieman Lab&lt;/em&gt; reporter Joshua Benton &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/09/ozy-says-its-great-at-discovering-big-names-before-the-mainstream-media-but-is-it/"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; and found that even in the cases Ozy cited, its coverage came months or years after the subjects had been covered thoroughly in mainstream publications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Ozy Mission - “We built our reputation on being ahead of the curve — we featured Trevor Noah before he was named host of&amp;amp;nbsp;The Daily Show, brought you Alexandria Ocasio Cortez when she was working as a bartender in the Bronx and showcased Awkwafina at OZY Fest before she became a Golden Globe-winning global star.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9zCttZIi92G5LYNJD_obN2ijAw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894840/ozy_media.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Ozy Mission - “We built our reputation on being ahead of the curve — we featured Trevor Noah before he was named host of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt;, brought you Alexandria Ocasio Cortez when she was working as a bartender in the Bronx and showcased Awkwafina at OZY Fest before she became a Golden Globe-winning global star.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yfQ8II"&gt;Watson told reporters on &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; that after a dispute over the name of its festival, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne started investing in the site. This week Sharon Osbourne &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/ozy-media-founder-carlos-watson-lied-about-investment-sharon-osbourne-says.html"&gt;said to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they have never been shareholders and called Watson “the biggest shyster I have ever seen in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCmkai"&gt;A former producer for the Carlos Watson show revealed that its big-name guests had been told the show would air on A&amp;amp;E and that it was a part of the YouTube Original package. A spokesman for the network told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/media/ozy-media-carlos-watson.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that A&amp;amp;E said no to the show before taping ever began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7itIDt"&gt;Over the last several days, former BBC journalist Katty Kay publicly resigned, advertisers ran for the hills, and its chairman Marc Lasry — owner of the NBA World Champion Milwaukee Bucks — resigned just three weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/marc-lasry-named-chairman-of-ozy-media-4aa5b0fa-68c4-4785-b347-a127c512964b.html"&gt;taking the post&lt;/a&gt;. This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/01/1041506435/ozy-carlos-watson-npr-board-resignation"&gt;Watson stepped down&lt;/a&gt; from the board of National Public Radio. Then, this afternoon, the news broke that Ozy was shutting down entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YMtf4y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;News: Ozy is shutting down. Here's the statement from the Ozy board &lt;a href="https://t.co/syOUrTtKBD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/syOUrTtKBD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Smith (@benyt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1444048250898685954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Xbox is making it easier to find accessible games in its stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox X in a circle logo against a dark background with green lines. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fal-LSEQOdyuUEyYmSuDS7yTH0k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69937114/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IhhMIN"&gt;Xbox is making it easier to find accessibility information for games, according to an announcement from the company at its &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/01/xbox-announces-accessibility-updates/"&gt;Accessibility Showcase&lt;/a&gt;. Games in the Microsoft store will have accessibility feature tags, so players with disabilities can make sure games have the features they need before buying or downloading them. The tags are appearing in the store for members of the &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-accessibility-insider-league"&gt;Xbox Accessibility Insiders League&lt;/a&gt; (XAIL) starting today and will eventually roll out to all Xbox users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XakC5T"&gt;The tags address an issue commonly expressed by players with disabilities: they often have to do their own research to figure out which games they can play. Listing certain features in the store consolidates information that can be frustrating to track down, especially if it’s not available on developer websites or in reviews. Publishers will also be able to link to additional information from the store. While the tag system is starting in the Microsoft Store, Xbox says they’ll also start showing up on Xbox.com, the Xbox app on PC, and Xbox Game Pass apps in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Microsoft store titled “Accessibility spotlight” showing categories for featured games, gameplay, audio, and visual features. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKE_KvgREAIk9ozCwSLZllNQ9pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22891763/accesibility_spotlight.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xbox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new spotlight in the store for accessible games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P81sKZ"&gt;Xbox says it plans to gather feedback from XAIL members over the next month before expanding the availability of the tags. Part of the fine-tuning for the tags involves determining specific sets of criteria that games need to meet in order to be labeled with each feature — a game with subtitles that can’t be resized, for instance, wouldn’t meet the bar for the subtitle options tag. The list of tags includes 20 features, like narrated game menus, input remapping, and single stick gameplay, and more could be added in the future based on feedback from players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRr2a1"&gt;“We look at this as an opportunity to up-level the industry a little bit,” says Anita Mortaloni, Director of Accessibility at Xbox, who hopes the criteria for the tags will encourage more developers to build robust accessibility features into their games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1wCdB"&gt;“As we continue on this journey, more and more titles will get [the tags] and hopefully inspire developers to look at those criteria and design their game with those in mind,” says Mortaloni, “because they know that once they publish, their titles can be tagged with those because they put that work in from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PhXlEJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"New accessibility features are coming to Halo Infinite ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704024/halo-infinite-accessibility-features-colorblind-steering-controls"},{"title":"Microsoft starts new program to help make more accessible games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286216/microsoft-xbox-games-tested-accessibility-guidelines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b4klEh"&gt;There’s also a new “Accessibility Spotlight” section in the store, with games in different categories based on the accessibility features they have, like audio or visual. Search results will be filterable by feature in coming months, according to Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho4QIY"&gt;Xbox also announced several other features that it says will launch soon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EZGX9K"&gt;Quick settings, which allow people to toggle accessibility features on or off without leaving a game or app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8o0XbG"&gt;Global color filters on Xbox Series X|S, for people with colorblindness to customize how colors are displayed across games, apps, and menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="or0pUC"&gt;Night mode with adjustable filters and brightness, controller and power button light dimming, and scheduling options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uWfjy9"&gt;A free gaming accessibility fundamentals course for developers launching in Microsoft Learn in late October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pacvbm"&gt;Watch the full Xbox Accessibility Showcase below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is offering free trials of Death Stranding and Sackboy in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qMIhrEbe_F7zlf7rWhYlJHOxU5k=/147x0:1208x707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69939278/Screenshot_2021_10_01_1.20.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkXjV0"&gt;Sony appears to be reintroducing an old concept for two of its newer Playstation 5 games — game trials. Sony will now let you try the PS5 versions of &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding: Director’s Cut &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sackboy: A Big Adventure &lt;/em&gt;for free if you live in the United Kingdom, for six hours and five hours, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9AvFS"&gt;PlayStation owners &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-offering-game-trials.494481/"&gt;first spotted Sony’s new offer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_wotta/status/1444006924261986344/photo/1"&gt;via email&lt;/a&gt;. “Ever wanted to try some of the most popular games from PlayStation Studios before committing to the full game? Now you can,” the email reads. Sony says the games are redeemable on the PlayStation Store until October 28th at 11:59PM, and the trial starts as soon as you select “Download Trial” on console or “Add to Library” on the web. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Sony for more information, but if you’re in the UK, both the &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01968_00-DEATHSTRANDINGEU/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01288_00-SACKBOYADVENTURE/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sackboy&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; appear to already be live.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIxlfelzFM2i4zeZvnD7FqHLd4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894558/sonyGameTrials.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s email announcing the availability of game trials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DETohJ"&gt;Ten or more years ago, offering a demo for a big blockbuster game wouldn’t be too unusual, but it seems in the last decade, the rise of free-to-play systems, public betas, and a robust Let’s Play community has sort of driven the “free trial” to partial extinction. That’s started to change yet again — &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/game-demos-are-back-baby/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; has a great piece&lt;/a&gt; trying to think through why — and it seems now Sony is dipping its toes in the water with two of its more recent first-party titles. Hopefully. that expands to more games and more regions soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1ayOt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to switch languages using the Android Gboard keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hMP-VXXAwqGtVMo3s3cxKrQrupo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69939082/akrales_190903_3635_0219.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dp2uwu"&gt;Learning a new language on an Android device? If the language uses a different alphabet or employs accents that your primary language does not, you may need to add a new software keyboard to your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssqMfc"&gt;Luckily, Google’s standard Gboard keyboard includes a plethora of language-related keyboards; at last count, it offered &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gboard-500-languages-935836/"&gt;over 500 languages over 40 different writing systems&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve already installed Gboard in the US, you’re likely already set up with US English. But it’s not difficult to add one or more new keyboards and quickly switch from one language to another. Here’s how to install and use one or more of the many languages available. (Note: this was tried out using a Pixel 3 phone and Android 12; your interface may vary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf1duA"&gt;First, you need to get to the “Languages” page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LGBXTY"&gt;One way is to open an app such as email or chat and tap in an area where you can type in order to bring up the keyboard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PSsHzl"&gt;Tap on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) just above the keyboard. If you don’t see it, click on the arrow on the left just above the keyboard to bring up the toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LP3vX2"&gt;Select “Languages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the gear icon above the keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qu9saZuI2orPNmInerzInO1hCK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894517/Screenshot_20211001_155057.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the gear icon above the keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The languages you are using are listed on the “Languages page.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ovDpoVdI47-LJKfF2CHVqMsj6gI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894520/Screenshot_20210930_164122.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your languages are listed on the “Languages page.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rqnSFe"&gt;You can also get to the page from your Android device’s main settings menu. From the settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yW7sE8"&gt;Select “System.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYny36"&gt;Select “Languages &amp;amp; input” &amp;gt; “On-screen keyboard” &amp;gt; “Gboard” &amp;gt; “Languages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wmVFz8"&gt;Once you’ve reached the “Languages” page, you can add a new language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yC7lsy"&gt;Tap on “Add keyboard” at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ww33gw"&gt;Scroll to the language that you want to add and tap it. (It’s a long list, so you might save some time by using the search icon on the top right of the screen.) If you’ve been using a language-learning or other language-related app recently, the one you want may already be on top under “Suggested languages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Add keyboard” list is very, very long." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TEM3khB2V0MuK2HyvlQYfagklRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894524/Screenshot_20210930_163837.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Add keyboard” list is very, very long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You may have a choice of several types of keyboards." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cK8372CgjSIHQsJWQY05EQHUPhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894525/Screenshot_20210930_163903.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may have a choice of several types of keyboards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rW5Whu"&gt;Depending on the language, you may be able to choose from a list of several types of keyboards on top of the screen. (For example, you may be able to opt for a QWERTY or Dvorak keyboard, or set handwriting options.) The most likely suggestion will be first, but you can swipe across to see others that are available. On the same page, under “Language settings,” the “Multilingual typing” option lets you choose to be given word suggestions from more than one language while you type. (Whether it’s available depends on which language you’re adding.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kvKuRC"&gt;When you’re finished, tap the “Done” button. You’ll be brought back to the “Languages” page where you’ll see the new language listed. Tap the left arrow at the top left corner to leave the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JxQ4bk"&gt;You’ll now see the keyboard’s language named on the space bar. (If you enabled multilingual typing, you’ll see abbreviations of both language names.) In addition, there will now be a globe icon to the left of the keyboard instead of the emoji icon. (The emoji icon can now be accessed via a long press on the comma key.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPywDn"&gt;To change keyboards, tap on the globe; your keyboard will switch to the next in line. You can also long press on the space bar and select the language you want from the pop-up menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Multilingual typing will give you suggestions from both your languages." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MCAuFjv2LANZtoP6Q09KCWvRpig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894539/Screenshot_20210930_164730.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multilingual typing will give you suggestions from both your languages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on the space bar to change language settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNEv4XPFYkkRrRuYNWbCha7EwRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894542/Screenshot_20210930_164746.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long press on the space bar to change language settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VzlAdz"&gt;If you’re no longer using one of your languages and you want to remove it from the list: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AruZjo"&gt;Long press the space bar to get the “Change keyboard” menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xm9Az0"&gt;Tap on “Language settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FX7J8F"&gt;Find the language you no longer need, and swipe to the left to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zQQlZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 1st, 2021, 4:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on January 3rd, 2020 and has been updated to allow for updates in the Android OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about the parents fighting to stop drug deals on Snapchat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06MV8OGKso3qXLDX6Y8MK19m6fw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938925/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HKFPNX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html"&gt;NBC has an excellent story&lt;/a&gt; that takes a look at the trend of young adults attempting to buy prescription or recreational drugs from dealers on Snapchat — and ending up with fentanyl instead. The report tells the story from the perspective of several parents who have lost children and who suspect that they bought the pills using the popular chatting app. It also goes into how Snapchat is trying to deal with the problem and the difficulties that come with that moderation, both for parents and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U1CYi"&gt;Some parents suspect their children were trying to obtain painkillers to deal with various pains that weren’t being addressed by doctors or dentists, while some say their kids were trying to escape a world of emotional turmoil. In at least one instance, a parent suspects Snapchat facilitated a deal with a drug dealer who might only live a few blocks away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pARD0V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Snapchat isn’t off the hook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tGGXwD"&gt;None of that is to say that Snapchat is off the hook. One mother talks about how the suspected dealer is still advertising pills months later. Another parent says that it took Snap five months to provide info to law enforcement on one suspected dealer, who was eventually arrested. Snap told NBC that it works with the DEA to figure out how it should proactively scan for drug-related content, and that it deletes accounts it suspects belong to dealers. As NBC points out, though, it’s not difficult to create a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8wvnP"&gt;The story raises questions about how to effectively moderate subjects related to drug use and the role of Snapchat in &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis"&gt;fentanyl’s wildfire-like spread&lt;/a&gt;. For that, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html"&gt;well worth the read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CDC emails show that vaccine cards are supposed to fit in your wallet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-FASHION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RstwQiemzZMKiQAznGFbLSXGWoI=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938866/1235132658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdXD1k"&gt;Since the dawn of time (around five or six months ago), people all over the world (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cr1nge_qu33n/status/1426357270082899969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1426357270082899969%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ange_lops/status/1396335977761808385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1396335977761808385%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sknight500/status/1394666513500622851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1394666513500622851%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;the United States&lt;/a&gt;) have been puzzling over a very important question: why doesn’t the COVID-19 vaccine card fit in a wallet? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KkQUxA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I tried to figure out why the vaccine cards are too big for your wallet &lt;a href="https://t.co/3JZ7LzZ6KR"&gt;https://t.co/3JZ7LzZ6KR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Amanda Mull (@amandamull) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amandamull/status/1425092823553134593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8lFIF"&gt;The card is too big for a standard wallet card slot and, as Amanda Mull pointed out in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/covid-19-vaccine-cards-why-so-big/619707/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, still small enough that it’d be easy to lose. It’s like a reverse Goldilocks: just wrong. A handful of people speculated to Mull in August that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention might not have thought about the size of the cards all that much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNsdz3"&gt;But it turns out they were at least &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about the size of the card, &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074134-vaccine-card-final-release"&gt;according to emails&lt;/a&gt; obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by a reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGbRF8"&gt;Email correspondence within the CDC shows that the agency was working on a vaccination card at the start of August 2020, months before the first COVID-19 vaccines would be authorized for use. On August 6, a staffer sent an email with a draft vaccination card attached. “Keep in mind that the card needs to be small enough to fit in a wallet,” the staffer wrote in an email. “Most cards I see are around 4” x 3.5” and are usually folded.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pX3U5CMepZgg8P6S59HkkKrVHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894528/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_3.13.13_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RkPnwL"&gt;It’s important to note here that wallet-sized things are much smaller than 4” x 3.5”. Wallet-sized photos are 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches, and standard credit cards are 2.125 inches by 3.37 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtcxRZ"&gt;But the key bit of info comes at the end of the sentence: “usually folded.” If the cards were 4 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall, folding them in half would make them 2 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall. That’s pretty close to the size of a standard credit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Threse"&gt;And that wasn’t even the final dimensions of the cards. The following Saturday, Operation Warp Speed, which headed the vaccine development process, asked the CDC to send over the vaccine card by the end of the day Monday. The CDC team went into overdrive to finalize the design by the deadline, and the same staffer sent over a print-ready version on Tuesday morning. In that email, the dimensions of the card were set at 4.25 inches by 3.5 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8ZkHKp-AyDTwaQanZibuG3amkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894447/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_1.31.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="apNhgZ"&gt;Ok, time for more math. Folding&lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;sized card in half would put the card at 2.125 inches by 3.5 inches, just about the same size as a credit card. Excellent! Perfect size to meet the goal of fitting in a wallet. All set, good to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7ZxBu"&gt;But unfortunately, this story doesn’t have a happy ending. Even if the CDC designed the card to be that size, it’s not the size the cards ended up at. My vaccine card measures in at 4 inches by 3 inches — too big to fit into a wallet. There’s nothing on the card to suggest folding it. And besides, folding it in half puts at 2 inches by 3 inches (so much math today). That’s smaller than a credit card and just small enough that it would slide down into a card slot and be difficult to dig out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRuMEs"&gt;What happened in between these emails, which promised a card that would fit in wallets, and the vaccination campaign, which gave everyone cards that don’t easily fit in wallets? That’s where things get fuzzy, and it’s a mystery I still haven’t solved. The CDC didn’t respond to a request for comment. Maybe someone just clicked the wrong button on a printer at some point. But maybe there’s a lesson here: the road to hell is paved with good intentions — and infuriatingly shaped cardstock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPLAnt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QKmxP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord is ending its Stage Discovery tool but says Stage Channels are doing well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lnnEIoLmx9Rm2YGKXh78ky_Jmks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938784/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Discord is ending its Stage Discovery | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkjTIA"&gt;Discord said Friday it’s going to sunset its Stage Discovery tool on October 4th, less than six months after it launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMAq3s"&gt;Rolled out in June, Stage Discovery was designed to help users find its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;social audio rooms called Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;. It used machine learning to curate a list of channels a user might be interested in joining. Stage Channels have been a hit, Discord says, but it’s been keeping an eye on Stage Discovery to evaluate whether it’s meeting its goal of helping people find community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0FNpB"&gt;“In listening to our communities and admins directly, we’ve learned that we still have work to do in regards to server onboarding and moderation,”&lt;a href="https://discord.com/blog/whats-next-for-communities-at-discord"&gt; Discord said in a release&lt;/a&gt; announcing the decision. “We’re going to take some time to rethink the Discovery aspect of Stages and how we can better build a place that best connects people to the communities most relevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kyl3T"&gt;Discord says it will continue to invest in Stage Channels, adding several new features, including the ability to schedule events, extra screening capability, and improvements to its moderation tools “to help moderators on Discord keep things orderly and foster healthy engagement within their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2FgsP"&gt;More than a million Discord communities have run a Stage as of October 1st, the company added, using it to host ask-me-anything discussions, open-mic competitions, art conferences, and “discussions over what sorts of foods pineapple should be on” (editor note: definitely not pizza). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch is testing a feature that lets viewers pay to promote streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ysGpOLKOkck7plJr4dZnAnrWGbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938775/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNKOsx"&gt;Days after announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700937/twitch-safety-tools-verification-phone-hate-raids"&gt;new safety tools&lt;/a&gt; designed to protect streamers against hate raids, Twitch is experimenting with a new feature that will allow users to pay money to promote a stream. Rumors have been circulating on social media that the new feature is in the works, and a Twitch spokesperson has now confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it is testing the feature with a small number of streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8ymVA"&gt;“We are launching an experiment to a small number of growing channels that enables their communities to purchase promotions to highly visible parts of Twitch,” a Twitch spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1tv41"&gt;Twitch went into detail about the new paid boost feature during its Patch Notes program. Check out the relevant portion of the program &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1163663809?t=00h42m08s"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHVaA4"&gt;The promotion works like this. For 10 minutes during a stream, a notification will pop up informing viewers that the boost option is available. Participating viewers can then pay for a number of recommendations. In the demonstration, there are two purchase tiers: 1,000 recommendations for .99 cents and 3,000 recommendations for $2.97. These boost purchase windows occur randomly for participating streamers and can happen as often as every time a streamer goes live. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uK3ucdi-ucaQLJdUv58P3ivP1Hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22894461/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Twitch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demo of the paid per boost feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TqRuWM"&gt;This boost feature is essentially a paid version of the “Boost this stream” community challenge program &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/boost-this-stream?language=en_US"&gt;already in place&lt;/a&gt;. In Boost this stream, viewers can pool channel points — essentially points a viewer earns by participating in stream activities like following and successive viewing — and use them to promote a creator throughout the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLCp61"&gt;Jacob Rosok, Twitch product manager, said this new paid program was born out of feedback from the community. He said streamers wanted more opportunities to have their stream promoted and wanted that promotion to be more impactful. That meaningfulness, then, seems to be Twitch simply giving “impact” a monetary value. The more money spent on recommendations, the more front-page exposure a streamer gets, the more “impact” a boosted stream has for its creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBhEfC"&gt;At any given time, there are hundreds of thousands of creators streaming on Twitch, all vying for more eyeballs on their stream. But the algorithm that suggests streamers to viewers tends to favor the top streamers — behemoths like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442733/amouranth-twitch-ads-suspended-indefinitely"&gt;Amouranth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/auronplay"&gt;auronplay&lt;/a&gt;, who have millions of subscribers and average tens of thousands of viewers at a time. So for smaller streamers, one of their only hopes of discoverability depends on landing on the coveted front page of Twitch. This new boost program essentially allows streamers to bypass the luck of the algorithm draw and directly pay for their time on top. Getting on the front page means more viewers. More viewers means more revenue from ads, more revenue from subscriptions, and greater appeal when applying for sponsorships that also leads to, you guessed it, more revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBVBsg"&gt;And at every level, Twitch is taking a portion of that revenue. Twitch currently takes 50 percent of a streamer’s subscription revenue (less if you’re a special partner). When a viewer buys bits to cheer with, Twitch takes a portion of that purchase, too. Twitch also takes a slice of ad revenue, but none of the money spent boosting a stream is split with the creator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vREiBu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We think that paying to help a creator grow their community will be worthwhile to their supporters.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JQd3Ch"&gt;It feels a bit like a gacha game. Sure, you can play for free (ala participate in community challenges), but to get a chance at the good stuff (ala rapid community growth), you gotta pay. And like any gacha game, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/30/21540515/genshin-impact-gacha-f2p-mtash-tectone-wish-giving-up-youtube-mihoyo-ps4-whales"&gt;there will inevitably be whales&lt;/a&gt;. Twitch knows that community members want to see their streamers succeed. What better way, then, to ensure that success than by simply paying for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opgFTf"&gt;“We think that paying to help a creator grow their community will be worthwhile to their supporters,” Rosok says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejQnSz"&gt;There are other ways for viewers to support streamers and for streamers to find larger audiences. Tags allow viewers to search for streams that meet their specific criteria. Raids (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;of the non-hate variety&lt;/a&gt;) share one creator’s viewers with another. Promotions during Black History Month, Pride Month, and Global Accessibility Awareness Day also push smaller streamers to the top of the front page. Rosok also emphasizes that the free community challenge version of stream boosting will remain available for people who don’t want to spend money but still want to support their streamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhkov8"&gt;Right now, the program is only targeted to small streamers with less than 250 followers and will last the next four weeks. Twitch will share data with creators so they can measure the impact a boost has on their traffic. Twitch also stresses that this is just an experiment and that there is no guarantee the program will roll out sitewide or even in its current form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6VBX7"&gt;“This experiment is not final and will continue to evolve based on community feedback,” a Twitch spokesperson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvdhfj"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cy9sCY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTiKiM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>South Korean ISP SK Broadband sues Netflix for millions in bandwidth usage fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZEA7Gra71GKkSXIWGbO0pbCo7HI=/882x0:4257x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69938416/Screen_Shot_2021_10_01_at_10.16.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epr73W"&gt;South Korean internet service provider SK Broadband is suing Netflix to pay for the increased network costs and bandwidth usage the streaming service’s content has drawn in South Korea, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/skorea-broadband-firm-sues-netflix-after-traffic-surge-squid-game-2021-10-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. The company cites &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;D.P.&lt;/em&gt;, two popular Korean Netflix dramas, as part of the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3riSO"&gt;SK Broadband’s demand for payment isn’t unfounded. A South Korean court sided with the ISP in June, &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210628000798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting Netflix was responsible for the demands its content puts on SK. Counter to Netflix’s request that it not be charged — since customers are the ones streaming, and they already pay for it — the court said the company has “the obligation of paying the price for the services to SK Broadband.” SK estimates the cost at 27.2 billion won (around $23 million) for 2020 alone, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaAFf5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Netflix for comment. The company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/south-korean-isp-sk-broadband-counterclaims-against-netflix-for-bandwidth-usage-fees/"&gt;shared the following statement with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in response to SK’s demands: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UG2zOj"&gt;We will review the claim that SK Broadband has filed against us. In the meantime, we continue to seek open dialogue and explore ways of working with SK Broadband in order to ensure a seamless streaming experience for our shared customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S47Lou"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-korea-the-story-so-far"&gt;success in Korea&lt;/a&gt; and in popularizing Korean film and television in the US has come to a head in the last year, and particularly in the last week, thanks to the surprise hit &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/squid-game-may-end-up-netflix-biggest-show-ever-netflix-co-ceo-says/"&gt;Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it was on track to be the company’s most popular show yet, and within four days of its release, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/global/asia/squid-game-director-hwang-dong-hyuk-korean-series-global-success-1235073355/"&gt;it was already number one in the US&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix’s top ten chart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZzdLT"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/23/5439566/the-wall-street-journal-confirms-multiyear-traffic-deal-between"&gt;strikes deals with service providers like Comcast in the US&lt;/a&gt; so that its connection gets priority treatment and, ultimately, better video quality. However, Netflix is in a different position now than when it agreed to pay Comcast — it already lost in court, and SK Telecom isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/24/5541916/netflix-deal-with-the-devil-why-reed-hastings-violated-his-principles"&gt;incentivized to make a deal while regulators consider a pending Big Cable merger&lt;/a&gt; — so even though it has more weight to throw around, it’s also already provided an example of why it might pay in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmYzTo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, which owns &lt;/em&gt;The Verge.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdJ0B7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
