    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Weird Apple design: ‘Spring Loaded’ edition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l545-m0sx8cwjt0bJs9_bsClobA=/231x0:2637x1604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176346/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.33.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac’s big chin.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UyKg81"&gt;Apple’s product design is usually very good, setting industry standards for how many of the gadgets and computers we use every day look and feel. But the company’s many hits make the less obvious design decisions stand out that much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtX65y"&gt;Thanks to the huge amount of new stuff Apple introduced at its “Spring Loaded” event on Tuesday, we have a lot of new Apple designs to scrutinize. While the company generally did pretty well with this round of updates, there are still a few things that made us raise our eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8n6Tlw"&gt;The iMac still has a big chin&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twrBv0Hp1a2Gbkio5xPerUdAiLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465084/apple_new_imac_spring21_pf_blue_04202021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iMac and its large chin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hMoHaK"&gt;I think Apple’s new iMacs look &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good — except for that darn chin, which, once again, proudly protrudes from the bottom of the computer’s screen like Johnny Bravo’s impressive jawline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlzqib"&gt;To be fair, Apple did what it could to make the chin look nice. The pastel colors are really fun, and I’m happy Apple removed the giant logo that graced the chin of previous iMac generations. (Remove the “MacBook Air” text from my laptop’s bezel next, Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqVNyt"&gt;And I get that the chin is necessary to allow iMac to be as ridiculously thin as it is. Instead of putting the computer’s internals behind the screen, Apple has stuffed them into the chin. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zTSll4M3e0UferpP1mpfN9_rAxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461554/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.29.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iMac’s logic board and cooling system, stuffed into the chin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nFskwN"&gt;Someday, though, I’d like to see Apple release an iMac with no chin at all — just a screen that’s a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kUMifA"&gt;The iMac has white bezels&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TplkHXkzNIO-1EvVBPr0BTiFU3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461521/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The white bezels on the new iMac.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vow78N"&gt;Perhaps the most surprising thing to me about the new iMac was its white bezels. Most of Apple’s recent computers have had black bezels, which typically do a better job of hiding the edges of the display and make it less obvious where the screen ends and the bezel begins. (The non-Retina MacBook Air, with its silver bezels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687417/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook"&gt;hung around until 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ypnoiw"&gt;But again, I have to give Apple some credit for its choice here. Black bezels paired with the bright new iMac colors would be quite jarring — the white looks great with the new iMac colors. And these white bezels are &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the giant black bezels on the Intel-based iMacs that are still on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1wyXQ"&gt;The new iMacs join Apple’s base iPad, the iPad mini, and the iPod touch in the white bezel club. It remains to be seen if the new iMac joining it is foreshadowing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="luxA65"&gt;The curved corner keys on the iMac’s Magic Keyboard don’t look good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USJjPE"&gt;The new Magic Keyboard has some nice upgrades, including a Touch ID sensor (which comes with more expensive models), new function keys, and color-matched aluminum. But the look of just four of the keys on the keyboard makes it much worse than the previous model, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrTIvh"&gt;Check out the keys on the four corners of the new Magic Keyboard. Notice how they each have one corner with a much wider curve than the rest?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aruhuy301-SGWzFmr40ygZ_o4ho=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22463676/apple_new_imac_spring21_magic_keyboard_with_numeric_keypad_yellow_04202021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Magic Keyboard, with the weirdly rounded corner keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CZsxxs"&gt;I just think they don’t look very good. I get that they better match the wider curves of the keyboard itself, but I think they look odd when all of the other keys have four corners with exactly the same curvature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNtCBI"&gt;Here’s an image slider comparing the old keyboard to the new. The uniform corners on the old model look a lot better, in my opinion. Look at that bad right arrow key on the new one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oj5FsC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10459575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zulWkv"&gt;And by the way, it looks like the Magic Trackpad that comes with the new iMac has the same wider corners as the new keyboard, too, based on a picture from Apple’s website. So if you want your keyboard and trackpad to have matched corners, you’re going to have to pay extra to get the new trackpad. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NqsP6iX7NdItMBo00JarMHxtBf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464798/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_8.05.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Magic Keyboard and Trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDWNW5"&gt;The new iMac does not have a touchscreen, despite looking an awful lot like another Apple device with a touchscreen&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PK1hbfo64f_Ttk3X62ceNRe7QCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22463711/Screen_Shot_2021_04_22_at_5.00.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hmm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xywJHp"&gt;The iPad Pro’s front camera is still in portrait instead of landscape &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8D7zOTtph2Rx7r36uibXLbUHcjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461630/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_10.06.27_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Pro’s portrait front camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZFsDj"&gt;Apple, once again, has released a new iPad Pro with a front camera that’s placed on top of the device in portrait mode instead of on top in landscape mode. That means if you use any keyboard case that requires the tablet to be in landscape and you want to take a video call (which is something a lot of people are doing right now), the camera is awkwardly off to the side instead of right above the middle of your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6bLbU"&gt;To try to get around this, Apple upgraded the iPad Pro’s new front camera to make it an ultrawide, and the company debuted a new technology that can automatically keep you in frame during video calls. But we won’t know for sure if that will keep you better-centered until we can test it for ourselves. And it won’t solve the problem of forcing you to look to the side if you want to look directly into the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5HEigT"&gt;The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro isn’t compatible with the original Magic Keyboard case&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tn1jiUHUdYBgvGh-7YNN1N45UPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19911773/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kkm8wv"&gt;Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399095/apple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2020-models-magic-keyboard-incompatible"&gt;isn’t compatible&lt;/a&gt; with the original Magic Keyboard case, which fits the 2018 and 2020 models of the tablet. It’s not exactly clear why, but it could be because the new iPad Pro is 0.5mm thicker than the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4JSu4"&gt;Regardless of what the reason is, though, if you’re planning to buy the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and want to use a Magic Keyboard along with it, you’re also going to have to pony up $349 to buy the new version of the Magic Keyboard case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xOcIoh"&gt;AirTags don’t have a built-in keychain loop &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuDV4kEAC6aBIbowdTFix0Yz13g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461541/Apple_airtag_front_and_back_emoji_2up_042021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag tracker doesn’t have a keychain loop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LbHWqz"&gt;Apple’s new AirTag item trackers sure seem like they should have an easy way to directly attach to something, but Apple decided not to include a small hole for, say, a keychain or a string. (Yes, I side with my colleague Chaim Gartenberg in his great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;AirTags keychain loop debate&lt;/a&gt; with Jon Porter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SV6BzT"&gt;The Magic Mouse’s charging port is still on the bottom, five and a half years later&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JY7mfNejfVDbX486GvNIzYAolMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9833361/Apple_Magic_Mouse_Bad_Design_2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is still how you charge the Magic Mouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K2aplw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394552/apple-new-magic-mouse-charging-port-bottom-lightning"&gt;I already wrote about this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kr2fYZ"&gt;There is some hope: it looks like Apple fixed its TV remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khCLGC"&gt;Apple’s new Siri remote, with its iPod-like scroll wheel, a five-way click pad, and smaller touchpad, looks like it will address complaints about the previous Apple TV remote’s annoyingly oversensitive touch controls. And the new aluminum design with black buttons should make it easier to see the buttons on the remote compared to the mostly black design of the previous model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this deep dive into Uber founder Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens startup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VH-8BaBADc7b8vQWUcXJuPbkIkw=/66x0:779x475/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176234/uber-travis-kalanick-vf-summit-2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="susc3u"&gt;As Uber founder Travis Kalanick prepared to leave &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/24/21036471/travis-kalanick-leaving-uber-board-of-directors"&gt;Uber’s board of directors in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, he was already hyping his next venture: a startup called CloudKitchens that rents out space to restaurants for delivery-only services. He predicted at the time that the startup would be “bigger than Uber.” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-founder-turns-real-estate-mogul-for-ghost-kitchen-startup-11603186200"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last October that CloudKitchens had purchased more than 40 properties in some two dozen cities, for more than $130 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJQ9Uf"&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-kalanicks-cloudkitchens-repeats-uber-playbook-loses-staff-2021-4"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that many of the tactics that became infamous at Uber — the always be hustlin’ mentality and aggressive internal culture — are in place at CloudKitchens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gzaymO"&gt;Inside CloudKitchens, people describe an alpha-male organization helmed by a “temple of bros,” in which Kalanick and two pals reign supreme and where a “Fight Club”-like code of secrecy affects all aspects of the job. Visual cues, like “No Quinoa” T-shirts worn by Kalanick loyalists, reinforce a hard-knock culture that frowns on coddled techies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DEgzN4"&gt;Kalanick’s time at the helm of the ride-hailing startup was riddled with controversy. Former engineer Susan Fowler wrote a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/19/14664474/uber-sexism-allegations"&gt;now-infamous blog post&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Uber had serious sexism problems; the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html"&gt;Project Greyball was designed to mislead authorities&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Uber to continue operations in places where it had been banned; and Kalanick was recorded yelling at an Uber driver while he was still CEO of the company. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick.html"&gt;He resigned in 2017&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from the company’s board of directors and shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVJ3CP"&gt;There seems to be a good deal of Uber-like chaos at CloudKitchens, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider, &lt;/em&gt;and it has led to a lot of turnover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="N7dAaI"&gt;Since the start of the year, more than 300 corporate employees have left the company, some of whom say they quit over paltry bonuses and a contentious new leveling system. And now, with the pandemic lockdowns easing and competitors pilling into the food-delivery market, the ousted Uber founder’s comeback plan will be put to the test — with his critics and fans watching closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EEzjLx"&gt;It seems like the strategies that propelled Uber to be (at one time) one of the most valuable startups in the world are in effect at Kalanick’s new venture. Whether CloudKitchens suffers the same fall from grace (and rebound) that Uber did is still very much up in the air. Go read this excellent deep dive by &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;that delves into the dark corners of the hot startup company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quiplash, one of the best party games ever, is free on Steam this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UEszbBfavIFWba5GsNvQdS1gz_Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176232/ss_b43742be0818c5c18a6415f51ac4d2e383aa732f.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Quiplash&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jackbox Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="in3R8d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt;, the hilarious sentence-completion party game from Jackbox Games, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/351510/Quiplash/"&gt;is available for free on Steam this weekend&lt;/a&gt;. The deal runs until April 26th at 1PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtAEjk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt; is, without question, my extended family’s favorite game for group gatherings. (Technically, we play &lt;em&gt;Quiplash 2&lt;/em&gt;, included in &lt;em&gt;Jackbox Party Pack 3&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re extremely similar games.) The premise is simple. At the beginning of a round, players will be given prompts to fill in an answer privately on their smartphones or browser. Then, everyone will get to vote on which response was the best by seeing them pitted head-to-head on the main screen (whether that’s a TV, a Zoom call, a Twitch stream, etc.). More votes equal more points, and the person with the most points at the end wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lbf8h8"&gt;My family can spend hours in &lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt; trying to make each other cry tears of joy with ever-more ridiculous answers. After years of playing, we now have dozens of &lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt;-related in-jokes (to my family reading this: SSQ), and there are even phrases we’ve had to ban because people used them too much. Best of all, &lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt; is really easy to play — all you need is a device with a browser. At the price of free, I definitely recommend picking it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZY2SA"&gt;Jackbox Games has also put a bunch of its other games on sale, and you can &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/JackboxWeekendParty"&gt;browse those deals here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro won’t work with the original $349 Magic Keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1j8ntN2FIvbvCJtwgIuxpUeXV-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176079/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1jUjU"&gt;Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a big catch: it turns out that the new 2021 model is incompatible with the old Magic Keyboard folio case for the 2018 and 2020 models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Caamg9"&gt;The news, first reported by French site &lt;a href="https://www.igen.fr/accessoires/2021/04/lipad-pro-129-de-2021-besoin-dun-nouveau-magic-keyboard-selon-apple-122043"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iGeneration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and confirmed via sources familiar with the matter to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;means that if you’re looking to upgrade from a 2018 or 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro to the refreshed model (with its Mini LED display, faster M1 processor, and upgraded camera), you’ll also have to shell out an extra $349 for a new Magic Keyboard case, even if you already bought the prior version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1cohH8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bad news for 2020 iPad Pro owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08S7i0"&gt;The 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro is slightly thicker than the 2020 version: the new model measures in at 6.4mm thick, or 0.5mm thicker than the 5.9mm 2020 model, an increase that’s speculated to be due to the more complex Mini LED screen technology. The updated 11-inch iPad Pro, on the other hand, will still be compatible with the older Magic Keyboard case (it doesn’t have an upgraded screen and its dimensions haven’t changed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG6aB1"&gt;The good news is that the new 2021 Magic Keyboard case is backwards compatible with the previous 2018 and 2020 iterations of the iPad Pro, so if you end up shelling out for the new model, you’ll be able to use it with older iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVREGv"&gt;But it’s certainly frustrating for anyone who already owns a 12.9-inch iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard to see that upgrading won’t just mean spending at least $1,099 to get the benefits of the new model — they’ll also have to spend the extra $349 for a new Magic Keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s amazing bipedal robot Groot looks like Asimo discovered cosplay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C0rFepbcQVrxXpfwft038fOeDz8=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176073/disney_groot_robot.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;He walks, he waves, he probably falls over in a strong breeze. &lt;/em&gt; | GIF: Disney via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zfGpCE"&gt;Disney’s R&amp;amp;D labs, commonly known as its Imagineering team, does some extremely impressive — and &lt;em&gt;expressive&lt;/em&gt; — things with robots. It’s made &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=theverge.com+disney+robot&amp;amp;oq=theverge.com+disney+robot&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4139j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;mechanical stunt doubles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/29/15702592/pandora-world-of-avatar-navi-river-journey-ride-review"&gt;lifelike alien Na’vi&lt;/a&gt;, and, uh, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/1/21544341/disney-skinless-robot-blink-human-robotics"&gt;this skinless weirdo&lt;/a&gt;. But the company’s latest creation looks like it quite literally walked out of a Disney movie. It’s a bipedal Groot that can amble about tether-free. As Disney’s Pinocchio would put it: he’s got no strings to hold him down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hes8JJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;’s Matthew Panzarino &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/"&gt;has the low-down&lt;/a&gt; on this robotic milestone for Disney. It’s part of the company’s long-term efforts to develop autonomous robot actors for its parks, says Panzarino, under the codename of “Project Kiwi.” The company’s engineers spent years creating their own free-standing bipedal robotics platform to power Groot, and Panzarino — who got to see the robot in person — came away impressed with their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EKrN9C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gaC29y"&gt;“The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically. The body sways exactly as you’d expect it. There’s no other way to say it, it’s ambling,” he writes of the robotic Groot. “The pint sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It’s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNCsUR"&gt;You can see for yourself below (though if your browser is blocking embedded YouTube videos, there’s a direct link right &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/6spi7nBqrro"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eR4gcx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6spi7nBqrro?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4B3Pe"&gt;What Disney has done stands up to the output of any industrial or academic lab (pun intended). Engineers have been working on bipedal robots for decades, but their creations are generally too unreliable or brittle to operate in the real world. Honda’s path-breaking Asimo robot was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514134/honda-asimo-humanoid-robot-retire"&gt;retired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; without ever leaving the lab, while Boston Dynamics’ Atlas can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/17/16671328/boston-dynamics-backflip-robot-atlas"&gt;leap and backflip&lt;/a&gt; but only if there are ample crash mats in its vicinity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlGRev"&gt;To be clear, Disney’s Project Kiwi isn’t ready to do a meet and greet at Walt Disney World just yet. As Panzarino reports: “I wouldn’t expect to see this in the wild soon, there is still a lot of work to be done on the way that Kiwi works and interacts with people and WDI does not have immediate plans to put it in the parks.” But it’s still looking pretty darn close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JrzWt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;notes that the robot has only a single cable to deliver live instructions, as well as a 45-minute battery life and built-in speakers for interactions with nearby humans (though in Groot’s case, the dialogue options are surely limited). For more technical details and the background on Project Kiwi, I recommend reading &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/"&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thank you for the memories, Siri Remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rT4fXeZaUdJ_leb-zSgmxY9I6Vs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176015/VRG_ILLO_4545_Siri_Remote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Wc76v"&gt;The Apple TV remote is gone and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;new remote&lt;/a&gt; — with the exact same name, considerably more buttons, and a two-tone color scheme straight out of 2010 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;has replaced it&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of people have rejoiced this move, but I am here to mourn a remote that had no business being as captivating for my thumb as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g07aNG"&gt;Technically called the Siri Remote, the super-slim minimalist remote launched in 2015 alongside the fourth-gen Apple TV (now known as the Apple TV HD). It was the third remote designed by Apple to control your TV and the first one to include a touchpad or microphones. The Siri Remote was named for the big Siri button below the touchpad and was meant to make the digital assistant a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/9/10948544/apple-tv-is-finally-getting-voice-dictation"&gt;more natural part of the way&lt;/a&gt; you interacted with your television. It didn’t do that for me, personally, but I may be an outlier on all things Apple remote. I just used it as a remote to control my TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjjh1s"&gt;I loved the Lightning port it used for charging. It was too thin to use the tiny coin cell batteries the previous Apple remotes used (and that I never had lying around my house). I could let it go months between charges, and then I just had to plug it in with the same cord I used to charge my phone. It was a nice little convenience I appreciated, and far more expensive and capable remotes, like Logitech’s recently discontinued line of Harmony remotes, felt old-fashioned next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAWrUr"&gt;The Siri Remote was also one of the first set-top box remotes I used that let me put away my TV remote. The fourth-generation Apple TV was the first with volume control over HDMI CEC. What that meant was you could use the included Siri remote to control your TV. While it didn’t have a dedicated power button like the new remote does, it was easy for me to turn on my TV by pressing any button on the remote. I could even control my Sonos soundbar with the volume buttons. Turning the TV off did require an adventure to the Settings menu on the Apple TV if you were like me and didn’t know there was a shortcut for sleeping all devices.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Being able to control everything with one tiny remote was a welcome change of pace from juggling multiple remotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EodowT"&gt;But I didn’t just love the Siri Remote because it gave me limited control of my TV or had a Lightning port. It was also because of the touchpad, which made skimming through content on Netflix or Plex or fast-forwarding through a show on Hulu an absolute breeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THBRLK"&gt;At least I think so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xrna5"&gt;While some (again maybe it was just me!) have praised the Siri Remote’s touchpad, the majority of people — including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/22268724/apple-tv-remote-game-boy-color-mod"&gt;bulk&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9297131/new-apple-tv-update-remote-2015-hands-on-video-photos"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; here at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300891/apple-tv-siri-remote-touchpad-button-design-form-function"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, every Apple TV user on Reddit, and my mother — absolutely hated it.  Many complained about the sensitivity of the touchpad, which let you fly across the screen with a swipe but required a far gentler touch if you just wanted to pop over a row. They also complained about how easy it was to accidentally select something or lose the remote due to its size. My mother even complained because she somehow managed to shatter her remote with an accidental drop onto her tile floor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of a broken Apple Remote. Followed by the text: Oops fell off chair. Put some tape on it. Should I get a new one?

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has not been fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bccDQY"&gt;I loved it precisely because it was so sensitive. I run my trackpad and mouse at similarly high sensitivity levels and like the ability to yeet across a screen with a flick. With the Siri Remote, I could flit from place to place or rewind back exactly 10 seconds with a very careful swipe of the remote. The tvOS user interface worked perfectly with the touchpad and every app icon’s appearance shifted slightly as you dragged your finger back and forth across the remote. More than once I returned to the home screen when someone called, and I used the remote and the app icons up on my TV as a digital fidget toy while I chatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnNBeB"&gt;The sensitivity of the touchpad also resolved naysayers’ other major problem with the remote: its size. I loved how it could fit in my extremely small hands and make me feel like the rest of you feel when you hold a normal-size remote. Many people complained about how it could slip in between cushions on the couch or disappear under an entertainment center or chair. But I’ve lost it exactly once, and that was because I stuck it in a jacket pocket and then tossed the jacket in the laundry. I never lost it when it slipped between or beneath cushions. It took just the barest of pressure on the couch to depress the touchpad’s button. Simply sitting down would reveal the remote’s location whether I wanted to find it or not. Finding it under furniture was easy, too. I just squatted down and blindly reached. If things changed on the TV I knew I’d come in contact with some part of the touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaXRzQ"&gt;I can only hope the touchpad built into the directional pad of the new remote is as sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2Hhx0"&gt;And it’s really everything about the new remote that has me missing the old one (which technically survives even now in a basket of remotes by my couch). The new remote looks so drastically different and is such a major improvement on others’ complaints that I feel sort of how that dad who never amounted to much after high school must feel when he sees his large son dominate in the popular sport of their hometown. “Oh,” I think, “this is what it was supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus is rolling out its new and more expressive avatars starting today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_voS2YkWbsEA3J8XjvuazuATz4=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175846/Avatar_Animation.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4v1Prd"&gt;Oculus is beginning to roll out redesigned avatars that are more expressive and customizable than those that launched in 2016. They’ll appear starting today in just a few games for the Quest VR platform, including &lt;em&gt;Epic Roller Coasters&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PokerStarsVR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt&lt;/em&gt;. Soon, they’ll appear in &lt;em&gt;Synth Riders&lt;/em&gt;, and later in the year, a new game called ForeVR Bowling will feature them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpLsuS"&gt;The avatars launching today, starting with those few select games, seem far more fleshed out. They’ll have legs in the editor, for one (though they won’t yet appear on your avatar in VR). The new avatar editor apparently allows for a quintillion possible combinations of hair, eyes, body type, facial hair, piercings, clothing, and other features. There’s no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13195664/oculus-avatars-non-gendered-virtual-reality"&gt;gender toggle&lt;/a&gt;, nor are there a pre-baked batch of face presets. Instead, the editor lets you dive into each facial feature, down to wrinkles, nose, and makeup. It’s like a glorified character creator from an RPG. You can make an avatar that looks similar to you or just one that’s aspirational, reflecting how you want to be seen in social VR spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus avatar editor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LZTDkcqaWjsXxd42Clc3vkD4IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464870/oculusavatarsnew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Oculus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the new avatar editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N7d2kt"&gt;By the end of 2021, Oculus will have opened its new avatar SDK to all developers, and these VR personas will be supported in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Ffacebook-horizon%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Horizon&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s own expansive social VR playground. Though, games are just one application for these refreshed avatars. Oculus says the avatar you create will eventually appear in some form within the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, and more, but only if you choose to. Oculus wouldn’t divulge any specifics on how exactly your avatar will appear in those apps or when. “We’re at the start of a long journey,” Mike Howard, product manager for avatars at Oculus, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuU8v5"&gt;Avatars first launched on the Oculus Rift platform in 2016 as “monochrome busts with floating hands,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13191240/oculus-connect-3-rift-virtual-reality-avatars-hands-on-video"&gt;as my colleague Adi Robertson put it&lt;/a&gt;. Howard shared that all of the avatars from the early days had eyewear on because they weren’t trying to simulate realistic facial features, particularly the eyes. Hand movement was the big breakthrough at the time, since Oculus had launched its Touch controllers for the Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTpuhm8KinoqN9aFE04NkWez9B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464901/ProPutt_2_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Avatars in &lt;/em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KGb4Fm"&gt;The design of these new avatars builds off the learnings from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17189516/facebook-spaces-vr-avatar-customization-options-oculus-rift"&gt;now-defunct Facebook Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and the aforementioned Horizon experience that’s currently in an invite-only beta — both of which opted for a more welcoming, cartoon-y look than the more realistic Expressive Avatars that Oculus showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17906514/oculus-vr-rift-expressive-avatars-eye-mouth-tracking-home-customization"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Howard told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that these new avatars are oriented in their design toward delight with attributes from animation techniques. The expressions look a little exaggerated, and they’re about as harmless-looking as Memoji. They’re cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB4ZzB"&gt;Despite their unassuming look, Oculus studied behavioral traits, like how often people usually blink and the speed at which their eyes shift around to look at points of interest, to make the new avatars seem more grounded in reality. It worked to make a compelling eye gaze, even though Oculus’ current headsets don’t track what your eyes are doing. Perhaps the next-generation Quest headset will, though. Mark Zuckerberg recently talked about eye tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “One of the things that I’m really excited about for future versions is getting eye tracking and face tracking in, because if you’re really excited about social presence, you want to make sure that the device has all the sensors to really kind of animate realistic avatars so you can communicate well like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="epic roller coasters" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_vQxbXNB_JTD1vOSUw0IQWvgP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464907/EPIC_ROLLERCOASTER.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Epic Roller Coasters&lt;em&gt; with avatars.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOMllw"&gt;As for making the rest of your body move in a believable way, Oculus is leaning on machine learning to make your arm and head movements look less stilted. It trained a prediction model that can guess your shoulder and elbow positions based on where the headset and Touch controllers are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Je1am"&gt;You can create a new avatar within the Quest and Quest 2 headsets by clicking into your profile. For Rift users connected to a PC, the new avatar editor will be located within the floating row of navigation buttons near the bottom of your field of view.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon tests letting sellers email customers directly about new products and sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TnKOFuYOgAPSYFzweNyRe0C1YGk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175673/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHGT0e"&gt;Amazon is testing a new feature for sellers that will let them contact customers directly by email to notify them of things like new product announcements or sales. It’s a major change from Amazon’s current policy, which is to limit the amount of interaction between customers and companies that sell on Amazon, outside of resolving things like returns or order issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEh4QB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/amazon-tests-tool-that-lets-some-brands-contact-shoppers.html"&gt;As CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt;, the new “Manage Your Customer Engagement” tool won’t let companies just spam previous customers with promotional emails. They’ll only be able to contact Amazon users who have specifically chosen to follow a particular company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tYayJT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwD_L7obHjo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P29wJg"&gt;Crucially, Amazon isn’t giving sellers blank-check access to customers’ personal contact information. Rather, Amazon will tell brands how many customers have opted to receive the emails, along with metrics and tracking of clicks through to product pages and any purchases that an email campaign results in — but not the names, information, or email addresses of individual customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVbSe5"&gt;The new email campaign option is a free service for sellers, but it’s only available to brands registered through Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://brandservices.amazon.com/"&gt;Brand Registry program&lt;/a&gt; (a list that includes big names like Garmin, GoPro, KitchenAid, and more). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tS9xL"&gt;But the new tool should be a useful one for brands that rely on Amazon’s store as a way to reach their customers by giving them a new way to loop in their most enthusiastic buyers of new products or deals. Customers who are wary of getting bombarded with thirsty brand deals, though, might want to take a look at which companies they’re currently following on Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: the two Apple events from this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12 and an AirTag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUcRPCQrksqNZ5vErcFW0gEowKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175456/vpavic_4547_20210421_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HiSohv"&gt;You may have heard of the new Apple products announced at the company’s “Spring Loaded” event this week — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;the redesigned colorful iMac&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;location-tracking AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and the boosted specs on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;the next iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. But there was another big event focused on Apple this week: on Capitol Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBOZAJ"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0Wmd05zs48HYLqPq2AkWK3" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9H9lt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1HLZF"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, co-&lt;/em&gt;hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;Tuesday hardware event&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;Wednesday’s congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to antitrust in the App Store with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; politics reporter Makena Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXqqlO"&gt;The show bridges the gap between Apple announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; and Tile speaking in front of Congress the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
