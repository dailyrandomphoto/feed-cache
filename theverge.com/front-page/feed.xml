    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant is $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestiPadDealsDecember&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F674982024&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have previously discounted both Wi-Fi models of the new iPad by $30, which is the steepest discount we’ve seen yet. While Walmart’s listing with that price is still up, the deal appears to have sold out, and other retailers aren’t currently offering comparable sales. If you’re looking for a deal, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling the new 256GB variant with six-month subscriptions to both Apple Music and Apple News Plus. Note that these freebies are only available to new subscribers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698590/apple-ipad-mini-jelly-scroll-issue-response-fix-lcd-technology"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KUcr6D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 has the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations but with refreshed internal specs. It could be a good choice for fans of the classic home button, Touch ID, and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;We’ve seen the outgoing 64GB iPad Mini with its older A12 Bionic processor drop to as low as $299, and the 256GB model was recently on sale for $495 instead of $550. At the moment, however, we’re not seeing any discounts on the older iPad Mini. Many retailers have discontinued selling the last-gen model, and even refurbished versions are becoming more difficult to find. If you have your eyes set exclusively on the 2019 model, however, Apple is currently selling a refurbished, Wi-Fi-equipped model with 256GB of storage in rose gold for &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1186596/7613?subId1=TheVergeiPadDealRoundup121321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFUQY2LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-iPad-mini-5-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$469&lt;/a&gt; instead of $549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6tfbCt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen, a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has sadly forfeited its headphone jack in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, there are no discounts to be had on the sixth-gen Mini. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, however, will throw in six months of Apple Music and Apple News Plus — as well as three months of Apple TV Plus —when you purchase the iPad Mini at full price, assuming you’re a new subscriber. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J6FD94H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in green for $569.98&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 5 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance but only if you’re interested in buying the massive 1TB variant. Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcpPjgDOGe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB, Wi-Fi-equipped variant&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99 instead of $1,299.99. Additionally, Best Buy will throw in a six-month subscription to Apple News Plus and Apple Music, if you’re a new subscriber, as well as three months of Apple TV Plus. If you prefer the 12.9-inch, 256GB model with Wi-Fi, it’s currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $929 instead of $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799. While we’ve previously seen the price of this model drop to as low as $649.97, right now Amazon is only selling it in silver for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0932B5NVD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749&lt;/a&gt;, which is a modest $50 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;Meanwhile, the 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in either silver or gray for $999&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date. The silver configuration is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also available for the same price at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also snag the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $1,099&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPaoS2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="vdWMel"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iuddo9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai Ioniq 5 pricing starts at $39,700</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0cCFmZkcJS7bof-LOA3dUBzIgc=/0x343:8272x5858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70267438/Large_45017_HyundaiIONIQ5RedefinesElectricMobilityLifestyle.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RaOw13"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;The Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt; is Hyundai’s first electric car built on the company’s new E-GMP platform, and its price tag has finally been confirmed. A &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3466"&gt;press release from Hyundai&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the Ioniq 5 could set you back anywhere from $39,700 to $54,500, depending on which model you choose (via &lt;a href="https://www.evpulse.com/news/hyundai-prices-2022-ioniq-5-and-its-right-on-the-money"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EV Pulse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9ZLbp"&gt;And although Hyundai recently announced the Ioniq 5 has an &lt;a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3463"&gt;EPA-rated range of 300 miles&lt;/a&gt;, that range is only available with select models (which we’ll go over here). It’s also important to note that the prices listed here don’t include the vehicle’s $1,225 destination charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F3blCz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The base SE Standard Range is the cheapest of the bunch, but won’t be available until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kjcLOi"&gt;In total, there are seven different variations of the Ioniq 5, and three trim packages: the SE, SEL, and Limited. The base SE Standard Range is the cheapest of the bunch, as it comes with a 168 horsepower (HP) rear motor, and a 58kWh battery that’s estimated to last 220 miles on a full charge. This model is set to become available sometime in the spring of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnEaPK"&gt;The rest of the lineup comes with a larger, 77.4kWh battery, and your choice between rear-wheel drive (RWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) drivetrains. The AWD versions are more expensive and come with dual motors, as well as have 320HP and an EPA estimated range of 256 miles. On the other hand, the RWD versions have 225HP and are expected to last 303 miles on a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4a62T"&gt;The mid-range Ioniq SE costs $43,650 for the RWD version and $47,150 for its AWD counterpart. Meanwhile, the SEL has a $45,900 price tag for the RWD variant and $49,400 for the AWD model. On the higher end of the scale, the Ioniq Limited RWD will cost you $50,600, while the AWD version is priced at $54,500. Unlike the SE Standard Range, the rest of these models should be available later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xzyi6"&gt;Despite the difference in prices, all trims still come with 350kW DC fast charging, along with a “vehicle-to-load” system, which lets you charge electronics, power small appliances, as well as juice up other EVs. It’s also important to keep in mind that you may be able to receive up to $7,500 in tax credit after purchasing an Ioniq, making its price even lower.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="a8AOYW"&gt;Apple has brought SharePlay to the Mac as part of macOS Monterey 12.1, which was released Monday. With SharePlay, you can now enjoy entertainment like movies, music, and games synchronized with your friends over FaceTime while on your Mac. (You can see a list of &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388"&gt;some supported apps here&lt;/a&gt;.) And if you want to share your screen with your group, SharePlay supports that as well. My colleague Monica Chin ran &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;into some issues&lt;/a&gt; with SharePlay on Mac while the feature was in beta, however, so hopefully it works more smoothly now that it’s available widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rvlAc"&gt;macOS Monterey 12.1 adds some features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;also found in iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;. There’s the new Apple Music Voice Plan, a more affordable tier of the music streaming service that lets you access music with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734185/new-apple-music-voice-plan-price-features-app"&gt;just your voice and Siri&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be able to designate people as Legacy Contacts who can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;access your iCloud data when you die&lt;/a&gt;. And Apple will now let parents enable warnings that appear when their children receive or send iMessages with nude photos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLznrt"&gt;The new version of Monterey is still missing one big feature, though. Universal Control, which lets you use one mouse and keyboard across Macs and iPads, was supposed to launch this fall, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;Apple delayed it Monday to “this spring.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp will hide your ‘last seen’ status from strangers by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Ocq41MK2VZ91EjhSM1nGbWy9sk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266874/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gdFpBh"&gt;WhatsApp is rolling out a new privacy measure that hides your “last seen” status from people you don’t know or haven’t chatted with in the app (via &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-enabling-new-privacy-measures-to-protect-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Previously, WhatsApp set the feature on “Everyone” by default, allowing anyone on WhatsApp to see your status. WhatsApp’s new update limits the visibility of your status to the people you’ve added on the platform, and sets the feature to “My Contacts” by default instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e0R8XP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a new security feature. Got this reply from support today. If the person has not got your number in their contacts, or you haven’t sent one message between you, last seen/online is no longer visible. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qLPtC6rPOA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qLPtC6rPOA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PsyColette     (@NiHaolain) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiHaolain/status/1468281924057763849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cK1lf"&gt;In a post on Twitter, a user explains that you may not be able to see other people’s statuses on the platform anymore, and also includes an email from what appears to be WhatsApp support that describes the new feature. “We’re making it harder for people you don’t know and haven’t chatted with from seeing your last seen and online presence on WhatsApp,” the email reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8eSq1"&gt;The “My Contacts” option for your “last seen” status was already available, but it’s never been the default on the app. It’s also worth noting that WhatsApp already has a “Nobody” option as well, preventing all users from seeing your status. Your status on WhatsApp lets other contacts know when you were online last, or if you’re currently using the app. While this may seem like a harmless way to keep track of your friends and family (and vice versa), &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; points out that some third-party apps actually exploit this feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iGOPT"&gt;These apps can aggregate the statuses of certain users, which may enable some to keep a little too close of an eye on others using the platform. Turning on the “My Contacts” options prevents third-party apps from logging your online status, as an app isn’t considered one of your contacts, and therefore, it won’t be able to see your status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuetcX"&gt;This isn’t the only change WhatsApp is making to its “last seen” status. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-new-last-seen-privacy-option"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that the messaging app began testing an option, called “My Contacts Except ... which lets users hide their status from certain contacts. WhatsApp has also been working to bolster user privacy by introducing an option to make its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820138/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-by-default-24-hours-90-days"&gt;disappearing messaging feature the default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6gt4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google starts rolling out major Pixel 6 update with camera and fingerprint sensor improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_scKM0uVXWY7xxH7o90HpDSMJvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266864/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iCZjNT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; are today receiving their most significant software update since Google released the phones in October. Last week, the company detailed &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/139017133/google-pixel-update-december-2021?hl=en"&gt;a very lengthy list of bug fixes and improvements&lt;/a&gt; that are included in the December update, which has now started rolling out to both devices &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/rfq63q/my_6_pro_is_downloading_december_update/"&gt;according to Redditors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3mLrf"&gt;Older Pixel devices already started receiving this update last week. But Google needed a bit more time to deliver the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro version since there are a ton of improvements directed at the company’s latest flagship phones. Google is also continuing to further polish and optimize Android 12 with this release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkRU8p"&gt;Headlining the list of changes are tweaks to the fingerprint sensor; Google promises “general improvements for fingerprint sensor stability and performance.” We’ll have to see whether unlocking the phones has gotten any quicker or more consistent after installing the update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqWtaD"&gt;There are also a handful of camera refinements that are specific to the Pixel 6 lineup. They include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UEHG2V"&gt;General image quality improvements in camera preview / capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wzpor1"&gt;General improvements for camera stability and performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ljpIlA"&gt;General improvements for auto-focus response in certain capture modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="omIKcy"&gt;General improvements for color consistency in viewfinder preview &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FIRNiW"&gt;Fix for issue causing blank viewfinder preview in certain conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tUSrlr"&gt;Google doesn’t mention anything about reducing the amount of noise in videos captured on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, unfortunately, so that issue might take more time to iron out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkLd9h"&gt;But the December update includes plenty more, like fixes for screen flickering and a bug that could prevent the display from switching its refresh rate as intended. There are a range of audio and Bluetooth bugs that’ve been resolved, and Google says battery performance and thermals “in certain conditions” have been improved across the entire Pixel lineup. If there’s a particular snag you’ve been running into, definitely look over Google’s list to see if it’s been fixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWTTV8"&gt;Notably, this update is also required to get the full 23W wireless charging speeds from the new Pixel Stand 2 that’s just started shipping to buyers. To install the update on your Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, head to settings, scroll down to “system” and tap on that, and then select system update. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OSHA opens investigation into fatal Amazon warehouse collapse in Illinois</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tornado Hits Amazon Warehouse In Edwardsville, Illinois" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6CZCqbiAubIZ95caLgV70LN5WM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266775/1237162477.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y5LjNF"&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has opened an investigation into the collapse of an Amazon warehouse in Illinois that left &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/workers-killed-in-edwardsville-building-collapse-include-mother-of-toddler-army-veteran/article_51515e92-02e0-54d5-a7c4-d6dd3a27d02c.html"&gt;six people dead&lt;/a&gt;. The damage was caused by a tornado that swept through the area Friday evening, leaving a path of destruction across three states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFtYyH"&gt;In addition to the six people killed at the Amazon warehouse, 45 were rescued, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/12/technology/amazon-tornado-edwardsville.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that local authorities had some difficulty determining how many people were in the facility at the time since many who work out of the warehouse are contractors for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txd01a"&gt;“OSHA investigates all workplace fatalities and we are supporting them,” Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmy9IS"&gt;As first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/osha-opens-probe-into-deadly-amazon-warehouse-collapse-in-illinois.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, OSHA will have six months to complete its investigation, issue any citations, and propose penalties if the agency determines safety or health regulations were violated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raSK2H"&gt;Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a tweet on Saturday that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the families of the workers who died. “All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,” Bezos &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1469849247042334721?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s new Reels Visual Replies are just another feature copied from TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ibl8NSfkaDCR-mfhRLtC5ard5P4=/246x0:1782x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266678/FGSDy6WVkAET_Cv.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks familiar...&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVkHyP"&gt;Instagram has added another strikingly familiar feature to Reels: the ability to add a user comment to a video (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/instagram-now-lets-users-reply-to-comments-with-reels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Now, if a user comments on a reel you’ve posted, tapping the “reply” button will let you add a sticker of the comment into a new reel, which you can then move around or change its color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ha61A3"&gt;As Twitter users pointed out in the comments of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1469444419656896515"&gt;Instagram’s announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the feature is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22583435/tiktok-reply-video-comments-how-to"&gt;how TikTok lets you do video replies&lt;/a&gt;. As of now, it seems limited to just comments on your reels — I wasn’t able to make stickers out of comments on photo posts or comments on other peoples’ reels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JH6w_gX_rfkXcq_ln6UHiWbSElg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085390/Screenshot_20211213_122859.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapping reply on a comment, then tapping the camera button adds that comment as a sticker in a new reel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JnCB8CZ6tVqG2TVVGLen4uY1FFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085412/Screenshot_20211213_122841.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can then resize, move, or change the color of the comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jGUr9D"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;its launch in August 2020&lt;/a&gt; (when we called it “similar to TikTok”), Instagram’s tweaks and additions have made the two platforms feel more and more alike. The maximum time limit for Reels was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596530/instagram-reels-60-seconds-time-extension"&gt;bumped up a few times&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the one-minute mark in July (just after TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;raised its max length from one minute to three&lt;/a&gt;). Instagram also lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360544/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-feature-launch"&gt;“remix” reels&lt;/a&gt;, similar to TikTok’s “duet” feature, and it just recently added the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778073/instagram-reels-text-to-voice-effects-tiktok-creators"&gt;text-to-speech and voice effect features&lt;/a&gt; that have been a staple for TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utkAXW"&gt;Even if Reels Visual Replies aren’t original, it’s nice to see that Instagram’s adopting the feature. It’s a fun way to interact with your audience, and while it may not be the thing that gets creators to jump over from TikTok (it’s certainly not as enticing as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777899/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors"&gt;Instagram’s up-to $35,000 bonuses&lt;/a&gt; for posting Reels), it’s at least one fewer thing that’s missing from Meta’s version of the app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A tornado expert explains why last week’s twisters were so devastating </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kentucky: Aftermath of tornado in Mayfield" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xwmcfYiXJ5bnLfGdDyz5QkQVLrQ=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266652/1237200100.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuVDXH"&gt;Meteorologists were&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrJeffMasters/status/1469700985102741507"&gt;shocked&lt;/a&gt; by the tornadoes that devastated the Midwest and Southern US over the weekend. The twisters, which struck during the evening of &lt;a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/211210_rpts.html"&gt;December 10th&lt;/a&gt;, plowed across multiple states with incredible ferocity much later in the year than most tornadoes usually hit. Entire communities were devastated, and at least &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/12/us/tornadoes-kentucky-illinois"&gt;90&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; lost their lives. Residents across Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, Illinois are still recovering and searching for missing loved ones.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWDPFv"&gt;Tornadoes are still somewhat of an enigma to scientists. We know the basic &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/ffc/torntext"&gt;meteorological ingredients&lt;/a&gt; needed to cause a tornado to form, as well as where and when they tend to appear. But what’s normal for the US — which sees &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/weather-atmosphere/tornadoes"&gt;more tornadoes&lt;/a&gt; than any other country on Earth — could be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/12/11/tornadoes-climate-change/"&gt;changing&lt;/a&gt;, according to some &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2021/12/13/tornadoes-kentucky-climate-change-study/6478150001/"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aah7393"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the relationship between climate change and tornadoes is still &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/tornadoes-and-climate-change/"&gt;hazy&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists still need a better understanding of what is the perfect storm of conditions for triggering tornadoes so that they can suss out how things could change in a warming world.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9wU8rq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You really don’t want to see this outcome.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZM2Cw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="http://people.se.cmich.edu/allen4jt/allen_homepage.html"&gt;John T. Allen&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of meteorology with a focus on tornadoes at Central Michigan University. He tells us what scientists are still trying to learn about tornadoes, and what we might expect in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6NKLT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxGoK5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who’s studied tornadoes for a long time, what was running through your head as you were watching what happened over the weekend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGtwxs"&gt;I’ll be honest, it’s never a pleasant thought. Having seen a few of these high end tornadoes in person and seeing the devastation that they leave behind, there’s a sense of powerlessness that comes from... you sort of know that it’s going to happen, but you can do very little about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spBBFW"&gt;In this particular case, part of you is just hoping that something changes in the storm: that it stops doing this and doesn’t hit a town or it misses a town to the south, or it misses that populated area. You really don’t want to see this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4qPn6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made the tornadoes that struck over the weekend unusual?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQABRT"&gt;What I think has made this event stand out was a couple of particularly long-track tornadoes that stretch from Arkansas into Kentucky. One particular storm produced an extremely long-track tornado. We don’t know exactly how long that track was, but it will probably find itself in the upper echelon of the longest track tornadoes we have in history. Another aspect of that tornado was that it was particularly intense. We saw quite a number of fatalities associated with this tornado, had a number of towns absolutely devastated by it. So certainly, it will be one of those historic events that goes down in people’s memories and will be something that will be felt by those communities for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XO7aGc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something that will be felt by those communities for a very long time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fqb3rZ"&gt;This tornado outbreak was certainly on the larger scale for December tornado outbreaks. We have had tornadoes previously in December, even on Christmas day you can have tornado outbreak if the conditions are right. So at least in terms of getting tornadoes in December, that’s not too surprising. The sheer number of tornadoes wasn’t overly large. We’re talking on the order of somewhere around about 30 tornadoes overall, we won’t know until the survey’s finished in the coming days.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQ0mCS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there anything else that might have made this tornado outbreak especially dangerous, like its path or the fact that it happened at night when it’s difficult for people to see them coming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V6GId"&gt;This area is relatively highly populated, and that’s never a good thing when it comes to tornadoes. Out in the plains, the population is relatively sparse. It means that there are fewer places that are likely to be impacted. But when you’ve got a very long track like this, the chance of hitting something goes up. As you move into the southeastern United States, it increases exponentially. [Editor’s note: some &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0048-2"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also found a trend toward more tornadoes in parts of the Midwest and Southeast and fewer in the Great Plains, where they’ve been more common in the past.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIZOua"&gt;Adding to that, we’ve got a tornado that’s late at night when people aren’t necessarily expecting it. That we’re not in what people typically think of as tornado season means that the overall vulnerability and chance that people may get caught unawares was much higher. Nocturnal tornadoes certainly have a disproportionate share of fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwdVPP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions are already being raised around what can or should be done to prepare for tornadoes in the future. What do we know so far about how climate change might affect tornadoes in the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7v1wgt"&gt;It’s very difficult to say specifically for tornadoes. They’re very small-scale phenomena. And even on a daily basis, it can be quite difficult to predict whether a storm is going to produce a tornado or not. A lot of the research that has been done to date looks at the sort of ingredients, the conditions that could lead to tornadoes: warm, humid air, changing wind speed with height, which allows storm organization. And what we’ve found is that, at least for the future, there is definitely an increasing sort of length to the season. We’re seeing more potential for these tornadoes. The storms that produce tornadoes in the fall and winter and early spring are increasing up to &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002277"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt; per degree Celsius of warming relative to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIe8An"&gt;We had an abnormally warm period — I mean, Memphis hit 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday, which was unusually warm for the winter. Storms rely on relatively warm, moist air near the surface to increase the available energy to basically produce strong updraft. So in this case, you get much stronger vertical motion in the storms and that tends to be a thing that we see favoring stronger storms which might produce tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk4INr"&gt;The other factor that comes in there, and one that doesn’t really change is wind shear. So if you think about clouds moving in different directions at different heights, that’s what wind shear is. What wind shear does is it allows the storms to sort of organize themselves into something that is more sustained. It lasts a lot longer. It’s not your typical everyday thunderstorm. This is a storm that, in this particular case, might have persisted for over seven hours. And those sorts of storms are known to be more frequent producers of tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udnoVA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how does a tornado form?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLvQJl"&gt;There are a lot of different mechanisms that we’re aware of that potentially could produce a tornado. Generally speaking, you need a supercell thunderstorm. That supercell thunderstorm begins to rotate at the mid levels and that process produces a downdraft that then causes rotation at the surface to become more intense, and eventually we refer to it as a tornado when it exceeds 50 miles per hour. But the exact mechanisms of tornado formation are still an open topic of scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfHSbP"&gt;In this case, we had multiple storms producing very strong and intense tornadoes. Usually about six or more is defined as an outbreak, although other metrics exist. Tornado outbreaks are associated with a large-scale synoptic system. This particular system ended up producing snowfall in the Dakotas. It produced strong winds through Michigan, about 60 miles an hour. That particular system, as it moved eastward, pulled warm moist air up from the Gulf of Mexico, which was running a little bit warmer than normal. That warm, moist air is juxtaposed with relatively cool air coming behind the system. The interaction of those and an upper-level system that moved in as well produces a large area over which the conditions are favorable. It pulls those ingredients together. And so in this particular case, we had a system that produced an unusually large area of favorable conditions, which is what allowed for long-track tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yl5mzy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do meteorologists forecast tornadoes? And how much warning do we typically have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XghqAW"&gt;Warning times on average are in excess of 13 minutes. In this case, we had in excess of 20 minutes for Mayfield, one of the worst impacted locations. So there was certainly good anticipation of this particular event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7bcIv"&gt;In terms of forecasting the likelihood of tornadoes, it really comes back to those ingredient conditions which we talked about earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vK6Yq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A question we’re still sort of trying to wrap our heads around.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4i5NSP"&gt;We have a whole suite of models we operate at our storm prediction center and other groups to basically predict the storms themselves and try and get an idea of will a storm form? How intense might it be? And we use that to formulate outlooks which are issued up to eight days in advance. The final outlooks are down to the day, then are proceeded by tornado watches. Tornado watches say, “the conditions are likely to get a tornado in the next few hours.” And then a tornado warning is, “the tornado was coming to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnV4Lx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are scientists still trying to understand about tornadoes?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And what makes them difficult to study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BlXzG"&gt;Really pinning down why is it that a given scenario produces a tornado, I think, is a question we’re still sort of trying to wrap our heads around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywFunh"&gt;It’s not uncommon to have field projects in which you’ve had extreme trouble actually getting out in the field to observe a tornado. At the same time, we’ve had other situations where we’ve had very good observations of these events. The challenge is that there are a lot of physical processes at very small scales that really matter for tornadoes. That small scale influence means that it’s very hard to actually identify which storm is going to produce a tornado. Which one is it? On the same token, is it going to produce a long-track, higher-scale tornado? Or is it going to produce a relatively weaker tornado? We don’t have great answers for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4T3BU"&gt;We really do need a greater degree of field observations. We need more modeling studies to understand what’s going on. There’s a lot of science and research that needs to be done and those sort of things need federal support to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNYFLm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH3Mua"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IsSiR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4KUfV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yO79gP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The MacBook Air with M1 processor is back down to $800 for today only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air is fast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO1qpXj53nwSXQfxIsb8Wy2UZZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266487/vpavic_4291_20201113_0380.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor first debuted just over one year ago.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ak2488"&gt;The MacBook Air with M1 processor, our top pick for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;the best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcsdQZjSND" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This brings the popular laptop from Apple down to its historical low price of $799.99. We have often seen this MacBook Air discounted by $50, $100, and even occasionally $150, but this level of sale is much less frequent, and as good as it gets. Best Buy’s deal on the MacBook Air is only running for today — scheduled to expire when it strikes midnight on December 14th — or while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuNF5X"&gt;The configuration of MacBook Air on offer today is the late 2020 model with the Apple-made M1 CPU, outfitted with the base-level 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. You have your choice of colors from its three options of space gray, gold, and silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOfFBV"&gt;There are few other laptops as capable in this price range as the MacBook Air, whether you’re dabbling in productivity and work, everyday home and on-the-go computer use, or even light content creation. Its battery life is also exceptional. The biggest knock against this laptop — dongle life aside — is the awful webcam quality. Though there are worse problems to have, especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;put some of that money saved toward a webcam&lt;/a&gt; that is much better than the cameras built into any laptop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 Darkplates made me want to grab Sony’s upcoming black faceplates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imTMP55o_4ZjSYBlgRljV9UssZE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266463/jpeters_211213_4919_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My PS5 Digital Edition with the Darkplates 2.0.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I now stan the PS5’s original design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="VIKJDz"&gt;Sony has &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; announced official PS5 faceplates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831965/sony-ps5-covers-faceplates-colors-new-controllers"&gt;in different colors&lt;/a&gt;, including red, pink, blue, purple, and — thankfully — black. But if you’re looking for an easy way to change up the PS5’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/6/11/21288541/playstation-5-ps5-sony-design-memes-roast-twitter-router-face-building"&gt;popped-collar aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to check out Dbrand’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733642/dbrand-new-ps5-darkplates-sony-legal-threats"&gt;PS5 Darkplates 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, which are more rounded and add a grille on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uDWbh"&gt;Dbrand sent some to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;and I’ve taken some photos of them on my PS5 Digital Edition so you can get an idea of what they might look like on your console. (Photos taken on my iPhone 12 Mini.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKgO2hKn09BukQfECr9Idh80gg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084990/jpeters_211213_4919_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Darkplates 2.0 look like head-on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zkYmDtCKxfXWighxVV_p6bXn7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084992/jpeters_211213_4919_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a look when the console is laying horizontally. I’ve also applied a Dbrand matte black strip to the middle of the console, which is typically glossy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="556FEs"&gt;I really like the matte black finish on the Darkplates 2.0. I feel it isn’t quite as conspicuous as the PS5’s standard two-tone look, and it matches well with the Xbox Series X and the black Nintendo Switch dock. And similar to what my colleague Sam Byford observed with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review"&gt;first version of the Darkplates&lt;/a&gt;, the plastic used for the Darkplates 2.0 feels sturdy — and I’m glad that’s the case since a set currently costs $59.05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wd7GEWJK5tglHWU8Sle2OYLgYd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084998/jpeters_211213_4919_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s my PS5 with Darkplates 2.0 next to my Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joUAAImTp1ZhXEZO9R2xmtmiP78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084999/jpeters_211213_4919_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, my TV stand is currently made of moving boxes. I’m working on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIXe7D"&gt;I’m less of a fan of the big grille that’s on each Darkplate. Dbrand claims on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; that the grilles make the PS5 run cooler. But I haven’t personally run into any overheating issues with my console when using the original PS5 faceplates, so I can’t vouch for whether the grilles make a meaningful difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGZnVQdHaDA9xhuowJj9gEZqznQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084993/jpeters_211213_4919_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The grille takes up a big chunk of the Darkplate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ou0Kjnvo_2MlFWJ-5z-s7kBY8iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084991/jpeters_211213_4919_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a closer look at the grille, where you can see the removable mesh grille on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6cyNm3"&gt;Like Sony’s official faceplates and the Darkplates 1.0, there’s also an Easter egg on the inside of the plates. Sony etched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icon microtexture&lt;/a&gt; featuring the PlayStation symbols, and the Darkplates 1.0 had Dbrand’s twist on those icons. For Darkplates 2.0, Dbrand opted to inscribe a lot of binary. I asked Dbrand what it means, and it said the binary is excerpts of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action"&gt;cease and desist letter Sony sent the company&lt;/a&gt; regarding Darkplates 1.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31SYX2k_vPGprjLHsUdYhTVh3fM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084995/jpeters_211213_4919_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s a lot of zeros and ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ5du"&gt;I expected to really like the Darkplates 2.0; I generally prefer black electronics, and I wasn’t a fan of the PS5’s design when it was announced. The color is great, but something about the overall look just isn’t clicking with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdakOV"&gt;Maybe it’s the giant grilles. Maybe it’s how the Darkplates’ design exposes the light bar on the middle part of the console, which can be distracting depending on where I am in my living room. But maybe it’s just the fact that I’ve gotten &lt;em&gt;used &lt;/em&gt;to the original design of the PS5. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still ridiculous, but to me, it’s what the PS5 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; — popped collar and all — and I’ll probably be picking up a pair of Sony’s new $54.99 color faceplates in black so I can keep the original look but with a darker color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rbz4O9"&gt;When asked for comment about Sony’s new PS5 faceplates, Dbrand pointed to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1470428336446967817"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KQZaho"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Called it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2xeHPI8Q0K"&gt;https://t.co/2xeHPI8Q0K&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jJ3M7N6onG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jJ3M7N6onG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dbrand (@dbrand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1470428336446967817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
