    <title>Facebook and Instagram will delete ‘sensitive’ ad targeting groups linked to race, politics</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzMqma"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;Meta, the new name&lt;/a&gt; for the parent company that oversees Facebook and Instagram, suddenly wants to be less creepy. According to a post on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/removing-certain-ad-targeting-options-and-expanding-our-ad-controls"&gt;Meta for Business blog&lt;/a&gt;, the company is blocking advertisers from using detailed ad targeting options that show ads based on your engagement in “sensitive” areas including race or ethnicity, religious views, political beliefs, sexual orientation, health, and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3H7gP"&gt;“We’ve heard concerns from experts that targeting options like these could be used in ways that lead to negative experiences for people in underrepresented groups,” Graham Mudd, Meta’s vice president for marketing and ads writes in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6hlNe"&gt;Meta emphasizes that detailed targeting options aren’t actually based on your physical characteristics or personal choices. Rather, they’re what advertisers &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you might be interested in based on your activity. Even still, detailed targeting can be harmful. Predatory ads &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/9/21204425/targeted-ads-fertility-eating-disorder-coronavirus"&gt;can feel discriminatory, reinforce addictions, negatively influence behavior, and even cause mental distress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vyZJFS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Targeting options like these could be used in ways that lead to negative experiences”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V9V4Wg"&gt;Meta is planning on hitting the “delete” key on many of its “sensitive” detailed targeting options, but this comes after several instances in which Facebook had to remove controversial categories in the past. Previously, advertisers could target ads to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2017/9/15/16313916/facebook-restricts-targeting-fields-anti-semitism-ads"&gt;anti-Semitic categories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232547/facebook-pseudoscience-ad-targeting-coronavirus"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. It also let companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18273018/facebook-housing-ads-jobs-discrimination-settlement"&gt;target housing, job, and credit ads by “multicultural affinity”&lt;/a&gt; that could exclude certain races. And only after the Cambridge Analytica scandal did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17174854/facebook-shutting-down-partner-categories-ad-targeting-cambridge-analytica"&gt;Facebook stop allowing third-party data&lt;/a&gt; for targeting ads in 2018, cutting off companies that sold data like your purchasing history to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PUWfPo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This wasn’t an easy decision. Some of our advertising partners have expressed concerns about these targeting options going away because of their ability to help generate positive societal change. We know this change will negatively impact some businesses and organizations. (3/4) &lt;a href="https://t.co/RpQ6124CKQ"&gt;https://t.co/RpQ6124CKQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roy Austin, Jr. (@RAustin_Jr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RAustin_Jr/status/1458165826670956546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tlgVm"&gt;The reason for this recent change might have something to do with protecting mental health, but if we look at the bigger picture, Meta is likely preparing for the outcome of the EU’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/"&gt;efforts to form regulations that ban tracking-based advertising&lt;/a&gt;. Meta’s global advertising system can’t effectively filter out certain areas, so it will have to turn off detailed targeting groups across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jG9oO"&gt;In the third quarter of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277963/facebooks-quarterly-global-revenue-by-segment/"&gt;Facebook’s total advertising revenue amounted to $28.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;, which may explain why it was such a “difficult” decision to make, as noted in the post. The change will go into effect across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger on January 19th, 2022. However, this still won’t stop Meta from targeting you based on your age, gender, and location — it just might prevent you from getting targeted based on your online persona’s affinity for an oddly specific subgroup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix reveals Straw Hats cast for upcoming One Piece live-action show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HR6IsJ-qdOekZwhQkEu8m4OABk8=/98x0:2903x1870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119438/FDx1CWLWYAgipIp.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UdFlYr"&gt;Netflix has revealed five key cast members for its upcoming show based on the hugely popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114640/netflix-one-piece-live-action-series-reported"&gt;manga and anime franchise &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The cast, announced Tuesday, will play characters in the Straw Hats crew, the central group of the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__54715zz3bsg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458192236227743758"&gt;currently announced cast stars&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LrlA5O"&gt;Iñaki Godoy as Luffy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A5aiQ5"&gt;Mackenyu as Zoro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MVGj4p"&gt;Emily Rudd as Nami&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WknpJ7"&gt;Jacob Romero Gibson as Usopp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YP3rq4"&gt;Taz Skylar as Sanji&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="m7vARi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;welcome to the Straw Hats ☠️⛵️  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/onepiece?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#onepiece&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/s3UvjkShbL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s3UvjkShbL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458193689688383491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SZkLPQ"&gt;Netflix also shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onepiecenetflix/status/1458192931064455169"&gt;a note from &lt;em&gt;One Piece &lt;/em&gt;creator Eiichiro Oda&lt;/a&gt; about the development of the series, which &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/01/one-piece-live-action-series-based-on-manga-classic-ordered-netflix-tomorrow-studios-1202845657/"&gt;reportedly will have 10 episodes&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Oda doesn’t say much about what you can expect from the show, and as for when it might be released, he alludes vaguely that “it’ll take a bit more time to get this show done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HSfxR3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMeTY2"&gt;Netflix has been investing heavily in live-action adaptations of popular animated shows. The company also announced Tuesday that it’s working on a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458011481576927235"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yu Yu Hakusho&lt;/em&gt; series for 2023&lt;/a&gt;. In August, the company revealed some of the cast for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621540/netflix-avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-cast"&gt;forthcoming &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; (which we also recently learned &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/daniel-dae-kim-avatar-the-last-airbender-netflix-live-action-series-fire-lord-ozai-1234867510/"&gt;includes Daniel Dae Kim&lt;/a&gt;). And we’re only a few days from the November 19th premiere of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747655/netflix-cowboy-bebop-trailer-premier"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Data used to build algorithms detecting skin disease is too white </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uIYwqscvvKqXPQBW9q3A7-4qSrc=/0x0:2130x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119416/VRG_ILLO_1777_AK_body_data.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ana Kova&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WV5rJ3"&gt;Public skin image datasets that are used to train algorithms to detect skin problems don’t include enough information about skin tone, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00252-1/fulltext"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt;. And within the datasets where skin tone information is available, only a very small number of images are of darker skin — so algorithms built using these datasets might not be as accurate for people who aren’t white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8pzQ7"&gt;The study, published today in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lancet Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;, examined 21 freely accessible datasets of images of skin conditions. Combined, they contained over 100,000 images. Just over 1,400 of those images had information attached about the ethnicity of the patient, and only 2,236 had information about skin color. This lack of data limits researchers’ ability to spot biases in algorithms trained on the images. And such algorithms could very well be biased: Of the images with skin tone information, only 11 were from patients with the darkest two categories on the Fitzpatrick scale, which classifies skin color. There were no images from patients with an African, Afro-Caribbean, or South Asian background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcHWcw"&gt;The conclusions are similar to those from a study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2784295"&gt;published in September&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22689562/dermatology-algorithm-transparency-google-skin-cancer"&gt;also found&lt;/a&gt; that most datasets used for training&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dermatology algorithms don’t have information about ethnicity or skin tone. That study examined the data behind 70 studies that developed or tested algorithms and found that only seven described the skin types in the images used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZtsGq"&gt;“What we see from the small number of papers that do report out skin tone distributions, is that those do show an underrepresentation of darker skin tones,” says Roxana Daneshjou, a clinical scholar in dermatology at Stanford University and author on the September paper. Her paper analyzed many of the same datasets as the new &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; research and came to similar conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGP9Dj"&gt;When images in a dataset are publicly available, researchers can go through and review what skin tones appear to be present. But that can be difficult, because photos may not exactly match what the skin tone looks like in real life. “The most ideal situation is that skin tone is noted at the time of the clinical visit,” Daneshjou says. Then, the image of that patient’s skin problem could be labeled before it goes into a database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJTXaU"&gt;Without labels on images, researchers can’t check algorithms to see if they’re built using datasets with enough examples of people with different skin types. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJ0cLr"&gt;It’s important to scrutinize these image sets because they’re often used to build algorithms that help doctors diagnose patients with skin conditions, some of which — like skin cancers — are more dangerous if they’re not caught early. If the algorithms have only been trained or tested on light skin, they won’t be as accurate for everyone else. “Research has shown that programs trained on images taken from people with lighter skin types only might not be as accurate for people with darker skin, and vice versa,” says David Wen, a co-author on the new paper and a researcher at the University of Oxford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkrADw"&gt;New images can always be added to public datasets, and researchers want to see more examples of conditions on darker skin. And improving the transparency and clarity of the datasets will help researchers track progress toward more diverse image sets that could lead to more equitable AI tools. “I would like to see more open data and more well-labeled data,” Daneshjou says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDSEsg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjD4e4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TwAmu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s CEO joins Apple’s board</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olhxTdZaaISl1hZAew0sPmyFElk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119330/acstro_190902_apple_event_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TAypCN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/"&gt;Apple has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s current CEO, Alex Gorsky, will join its board of directors. Gorsky’s move to Apple’s leadership team (he’ll &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/johnson-johnsons-2021-third-quarter-earnings-report-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;step down from his role at J&amp;amp;J in January&lt;/a&gt;) comes at a time when the company is focusing even more on health and how it can make data more accessible to users and their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5XdhP"&gt;In the press release announcing Gorsky’s role at Apple, Tim Cook calls him “a visionary in healthcare” who has a “passion for technology.” Apple hasn’t kept its ambitions in health a secret — the Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"&gt;largely seen as a fitness device&lt;/a&gt;, and its users can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/research-app/"&gt;contribute data to various studies&lt;/a&gt;. Recent updates to iOS and watchOS have brought new health features that make it easier to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22672388/health-app-apple-data-records-allscripts-cerner"&gt;share medical records with doctors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;family members&lt;/a&gt;. With Gorsky on the board, Apple could tap him for new feature ideas (such as what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;new sensors it could add to the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;) or use his expertise to add more integrations with the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Chairman and CEO of Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson Alex Gorsky speaks during an event at the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building March 10, 2021 in Washington, DC." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_vmsalqb0pgyuK0fT7eLHmRK6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000489/1306384587.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Chairman and CEO of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Alex Gorsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="V1LvOs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The unexpected health impacts of wearable tech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mAGIs8"&gt;Apple and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson have existing ties — the two companies are working together on &lt;a href="https://www.heartline.com/about"&gt;the Heartline study&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to see if the Apple Watch can help detect atrial fibrillation before symptoms become obvious or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQcTuz"&gt;Apple’s health efforts haven’t been without controversy, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594178/apple-watch-data-research-heart-rate-reliability"&gt;Some medical researchers have said&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s lack of transparency into its algorithms to measure things like heart rate makes it difficult to use data from Apple Watches in research. There have also been reports from inside Apple that the health division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710901/apple-health-clinic-data-misleading-culture"&gt;uses potentially misleading data to make product decisions&lt;/a&gt;, and employees also raised concerns about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536623/apple-primary-care-project-data-watch-app"&gt;plans for a trial where it would act as a primary healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBdlcU"&gt;It’s possible that having someone with experience could help Apple navigate these potential hurdles and make the Apple Watch an even more powerful health tool (though Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551723/johnson-stop-selling-opioids-settlement-new-york-lawsuit"&gt;faced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/"&gt;fair share of controversies&lt;/a&gt; since Gorsky &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/leadership/alex-gorsky"&gt;became CEO in 2012&lt;/a&gt;). It’s also possible that it’s more of a symbolic move to emphasize Apple’s focus on health — we’ll only be able to tell by seeing what Apple does with health in the future or if Grosky appears on stage at WWDC to talk about a collaboration between J&amp;amp;J and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5YP9VQ"&gt;Valve’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;$400 Steam Deck gaming handheld&lt;/a&gt; runs Linux, but it can play Windows games too. Many of them, anyhow! Some of the biggest games on Steam use anti-cheat software that doesn’t play nice with &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;the Proton compatibility layer&lt;/a&gt; which lets Windows games work. That’s changing this year, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games"&gt;both Epic’s Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) and BattlEye&lt;/a&gt; confirming to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that support is on the way, and Epic says it takes “just a few clicks.” Valve says BattlEye support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22737127/valve-steam-deck-battleye-anti-cheat-pubg-dayz-r6-siege"&gt;is as easy as an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6tiI3"&gt;But will game developers let their games take advantage? Not necessarily! We reached out to every developer of every top EAC and BattlEye game on Steam. Initially, only four of them gave us a definite yes, but it seems we’ve got at least one more on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxLTdw"&gt;Here’s the current status of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FsYmJH"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;7 Days to Die&lt;/em&gt; — No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="24vKam"&gt;“We have no comment on it at this time. Our game is still in development. As we are still in Alpha, we are not ready to give a definitive yes or no at this time,” a spokesperson for developer The Fun Pimps tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sMkd7Y"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2yC3Dk"&gt;“We’re checking with the Respawn team on this and will get back to you as soon as we have an update,” a rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on September 28th. We haven’t heard back since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nQA54a"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ark: Survival Evolved&lt;/em&gt; — Complete, November 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CZztMr"&gt;“Yes, we plan to update ARK settings to enable Battleye’s anti-cheat tweak for Steam Deck,” a Studio Wildcard rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22737127/valve-steam-deck-battleye-anti-cheat-pubg-dayz-r6-siege"&gt;Valve revealed&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Ark &lt;/em&gt;had already gained support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W5cOel"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Desert&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VMR55I"&gt;“I’m checking with our devs right now and will get back to you with an answer asap,” a Pearl Abyss rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on October 3rd. We haven’t heard back since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rr8tEx"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;DayZ&lt;/em&gt; — Tentatively yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rYBtGd"&gt;DayZ was originally a maybe, but the answer is now basically a yes. “If it’s all working as intended, we do mean to enable Battleye anti-cheat support for Proton/Linux,” a Bohemia Interactive rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that the team wants to test and make sure the change won’t cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnzmnn"&gt;The original reply was less promising: “At this stage it’s a ‘maybe’ for us – we are still evaluating Proton as a whole and cannot yet commit to anything,” a rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OrdEIb"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dead by Daylight &lt;/em&gt;— Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GlnkzH"&gt;“I can confirm that we plan on updating our EAC to support the Steam Deck in the future, but we can’t confirm a release date at this time,” a Behaviour Interactive rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b2aVjT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; — No answer yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AnhvTI"&gt;“We’ve been trying to run this down. We don’t have anything to share right now, today, but we’ll keep at it,” a Bungie rep told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on October 3rd. We haven’t heard back since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p0NUZv"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uypZxD"&gt;Even though it’s owned by Epic Games, the company saying EAC support should take “just a few clicks,” Mediatonic would not commit to an update for &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AX1C6"&gt;“Thanks for reaching out but at this time we won’t be making a comment,” a Mediatonic rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jNGoyZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i9zNhH"&gt;“I won’t have anything to share here, I’m afraid,” a rep for Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TrLWit"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hunt: Showdown&lt;/em&gt; — No reply whatsoever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wciYkG"&gt;Crytek didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s8Ck0U"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Paladins&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smite&lt;/em&gt; — Maybe, but not this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jRnoR8"&gt;“We don’t currently have a timeline available but hope to provide such support in the near future,” a Hi-Rez Studios rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NhbGgd"&gt;While we have been actively doing some research on the topic, it is unlikely this support would happen by the Steamdeck launch in December. Even though our games do share some similarities, each one of them requires its own implementation that is significantly more delicate than changing some settings in the SDK. Hi-Rez is proud to have its games available on multiple platforms and consoles, so we hope to be able to provide such support in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="64yre1"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; — No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HBEUje"&gt;“The team does not have a comment for this,” a rep for Krafton tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. We got no reply after reaching out again in November. &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; uses BattlEye, and Valve claims enabling it for Proton is as easy as sending an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jOGwGO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Siege &lt;/em&gt;— No comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N2bOky"&gt;“We don’t have anything to share at this time,” a Ubisoft rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. We got no reply after reaching out again in November. &lt;em&gt;R6 Siege&lt;/em&gt; uses BattlEye, and Valve claims enabling it for Proton is as easy as sending an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qWKf3u"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rust&lt;/em&gt; — Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zttq2h"&gt;“Yeah we’re working on it. Hoping to be done by the time the Deck comes out, if not it’ll be really soon after,” Facepunch Studios founder Garry Newman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qxevgr"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;War Thunder&lt;/em&gt; — Yes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4YOIKk"&gt;“Yes, we’re planning to do everything we can to make sure that War Thunder works on Steam Deck,” Gaijin Entertainment co-founder Anton Yudinsev tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUKY0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ll update this story as more top games offer a yes or no on support for anti-cheat on Linux/Proton generally, and the Steam Deck specifically. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9Nxze"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, November 9th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upgraded DayZ to a tentative yes, and pointed out the lack of reply from other developers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA delays ambitious human lunar landing to 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBFSpS6_6JKE4NQcpW4I8GS8bPQ=/375x0:4425x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119095/for_press_release.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of SpaceX’s Starship lunar lander, developed in partnership with NASA, on the surface of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; | Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tybViu"&gt;NASA is pushing back its target date for returning humans to the Moon, now eyeing a crewed lunar landing in 2025 instead of 2024 as originally planned. NASA blames the delay on recent lawsuits over contracts for the agency’s lunar lander, as well as changes to the scope of some of NASA’s programs and the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQKiyx"&gt;The space agency is eyeing a human lunar return with its flagship program, called Artemis. As part of the initiative, NASA hopes to land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon this decade while working to figure out sustainable ways to live and work on the lunar surface. Artemis relies on a complicated suite of vehicles, including the Space Launch System, or SLS, a massive new rocket NASA has been developing for the past decade that’s designed to send people into deep space and near the Moon inside a new crew capsule called Orion. In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;NASA also granted a $2.9 billion contract to SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to develop the company’s Starship vehicle to land people gently on the Moon’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pNjWJ"&gt;The 2024 landing date is a relic of the Trump administration, which also redirected NASA to return humans to the Moon and came up with the name for the Artemis program. In 2019, then Vice President Mike Pence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282598/nasa-mike-pence-vice-president-space-policy-lunar-landings-2024-gateway-sls-orion"&gt;challenged NASA to speed up its timeline for Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and to land the first humans on the Moon for the program in 2024. Such an early target received intense scrutiny, with many critics &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/science/trump-moon-nasa.html"&gt;doubtful that NASA could make the date happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dTfX3v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 2024 landing date is a relic of the Trump administration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LTtgpD"&gt;For one, the SLS rocket has been continuously delayed throughout its lifetime. Originally slated to launch in 2017, the rocket’s debut flight is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740741/nasa-space-launch-system-february-2022-launch-orion-artemis-i"&gt;currently scheduled for February of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, there is still plenty of technology that NASA needs to create to make a Moon landing happen, notably new space suits that the astronauts will wear on the lunar surface. Despite these issues, NASA leadership did not immediately do away with the landing date when the Biden administration took over. “It’s a stretch, it’s a challenge, but the schedule is 2024,” NASA administrator &lt;a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2021/05/31/its-a-stretch-its-a-challenge-will-nasa-land-on-the-moon-in-2024/"&gt;Bill Nelson said in June&lt;/a&gt;. But Nelson promised to give an update on the Artemis timeline before the end of the year, and NASA finally admitted today that the 2024 goal wasn’t going to be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLZXdvHNxMmiXgdvUkWkbddc-Mg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23000224/Artemis_1B_Crew_InFLight_orig.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of NASA’s SLS rocket with an Orion crew capsule on top&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SgSQWO"&gt;Drama surrounding the lunar lander that is critical for taking people down to the Moon’s surface has exacerbated the problem further. NASA originally hoped to award contracts to two companies to build human lunar landers, to promote competition, and have more than one option. The agency even narrowed down the selection to three finalists: SpaceX, Dynetics, and the Jeff Bezos-run Blue Origin. But after receiving less funding than expected from Congress, NASA only awarded one contract to SpaceX, prompting Blue Origin to both protest and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763384/blue-origin-lawsuit-nasa-spacex-lost-human-lunar-lander-artemis"&gt;then file a lawsuit over the decision in federal court&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sR2mvB"&gt;That litigation played a significant role in the delay to 2025, NASA says, because it prevented the space agency and SpaceX from working together on the lunar lander project. “We’ve lost nearly seven months in litigation, and that rightly has pushed the first human landing, likely to no earlier than 2025,” NASA administration Bill Nelson said today during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ULo8HN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;litigation played a significant role in the delay to 2025, NASA says&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7skXu"&gt;Now, NASA has shifted the dates for its biggest launches under the Artemis program. The first launch is Artemis I, which NASA recently said would fly early next year. That flight will mark the debut of the SLS, which will carry an uncrewed Orion capsule around the Moon on a multi-week trip. It’s a major demonstration to show that the vehicles are safe and capable of carrying people. The next major flight is Artemis II, which will be similar but with people on board. NASA announced today that Artemis II wouldn’t launch until May 2024 at the earliest. Originally, NASA had hoped to fly it in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlXCE4"&gt;Then, presumably, the lunar landing will happen sometime in 2025 at the earliest. NASA also announced today that there could be an uncrewed landing of Starship ahead of one with people on board. However, the agency did not offer details about how that would work, citing the lack of communication between SpaceX and NASA during the litigation. In the meantime, SpaceX has been hard at work building and developing Starship prototypes at its launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, as the company urgently works toward the first orbital test flight of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oKK66"&gt;Along with adjusting timelines, NASA also said it would be updating the costs for some of the Artemis programs, notably the Orion crew capsule. The original baseline development cost for the spacecraft was supposed to be $6.7 billion, but now NASA is adjusting that to $9.3 billion through its first crewed launch in May of 2024. NASA also said that the development cost for SLS will be $11 billion through its first launch on Artemis I, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2020/08/26/eyes-forward-as-artemis-missions-set-to-begin-next-year/"&gt;up from an estimated $9.1 billion cited last year&lt;/a&gt;. The agency says it hopes to streamline SLS operations moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxdFgt"&gt;NASA blamed other factors for the delays and rising costs. In addition to the Blue Origin litigation halting the relationship between SpaceX and NASA, Nelson argued that the scope of the Orion project has increased over time and that COVID caused disruptions in the supply chain that have had an effect on production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bb5qXj"&gt;A lack of funding from Congress has also contributed to the delays. Last year, NASA had asked for $3.2 billion to jumpstart production of the human lunar lander in 2021 but only received a quarter of that request. And in addition to the funding, Nelson argued that “the Trump administration target of 2024 human landing was not grounded in technical feasibility.” It’s unclear how the 2025 landing is more grounded, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuBOWo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBPH21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apjxNh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1yIZO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unity to pay $1.6 billion for The Lord of the Rings VFX maker Weta Digital</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Legendary Pictures Preview And Panel - Comic-Con International 2014" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QMI0BingefSMaap0mRp9ctymoVA=/3x0:3947x2629/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119089/452735254.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zs8jqk"&gt;Unity, which makes the popular Unity game development engine, announced an intent to acquire the tools, pipeline, technology, and some engineering staff from Weta Digital, which is perhaps best known for its work on the &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; movies. Weta Digital was co-founded by &lt;em&gt;LOTR&lt;/em&gt; director Peter Jackson and has worked on huge entertainment franchises like &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt;, and many Marvel movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcZWMt"&gt;The deal is a major bid by Unity to bring powerful new tools to visual effects (VFX) teams, game developers, and other industries that rely on computer graphics. It’s also a big move to compete with Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, which has been used by Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145671/mandalorian-sets-stagecraft-epic-games-ilm-fortnite-baby-yoda-digital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;mixed reality esports stages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Laml4t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;275 Weta Digital engineers will move to Unity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="62r8ut"&gt;Unity intends to purchase Weta Digital for $1.625 billion in cash and stock, and the deal is expected to close during Unity’s fourth quarter (which we are currently in), according to a &lt;a href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2021/Unity-Announces-Intent-to-Acquire-Weta-Digital/default.aspx"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. Two hundred seventy-five of Weta Digital’s engineers will move over to Unity, as will “dozens” of the company’s tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIwyhV"&gt;The VFX teams at Weta Digital aren’t included in the deal; instead, they will be part of a standalone entity called WetaFX that will still be majority owned by Jackson. Weta Digital is also entirely separate from &lt;a href="https://www.wetaworkshop.com/"&gt;Weta Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which makes physical props and costumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyuu6Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ecobee’s new home security service has a professional monitoring option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ecobee SmartCamera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Gz1B8cxDi6wcYM9eB5u3WkJZJs=/360x0:2520x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118947/ecobee_SmartCamera_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv0epS"&gt;Ecobee now gives you the option to pair its smart home monitoring devices with a professional security service. With the company’s new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-security%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Security&lt;/a&gt; service, which replaces the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;Haven service it formerly offered&lt;/a&gt;, you can enable 24/7 professional monitoring (which is still in beta) for an additional $10 / month as a part of the Complete subscription plan. This price is half of what Ring now charges for its Pro plan that comes with a &lt;a href="https://ring.com/protect-plan-2"&gt;professional live monitoring service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFbOi"&gt;Ecobee’s Smart Security service uses the &lt;a href="https://rapidsos.com/"&gt;RapidSOS&lt;/a&gt; emergency response platform to send crucial data to emergency responders. It relays your home’s entry and exit data to first responders, as well as any video and audio snippets captured by Ecobee devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MeEZVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ecobee is offering a $5 / month Standard plan and a $10 / month Complete plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YHJHGR"&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that some features only work with certain devices. The Smart Security suite makes use of Ecobee’s entire lineup of products, all of which it sells — sans the SmartCamera — in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsolutions-exclusives%2Fefficiency-and-security-solution%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Efficiency and Security Solution bundle for $279.99&lt;/a&gt;. In the kit, you’ll get everything you need to get started with the Smart Security service: two SmartSensors for doors and windows, one regular SmartSensor, and a SmartThermostat with voice control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcNKpU"&gt;In case you want to add the SmartCamera with that bundle, expect to pay a total of $379.98. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;$99.99 SmartCamera&lt;/a&gt; also integrates with the service, as its optional video verification feature can send footage to monitoring centers whenever the camera detects the sound of a smoke alarm — if an emergency is confirmed, dispatchers may be able to send responders faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Fxc6c"&gt;If you don’t need live monitoring, Ecobee offers a $5 / month Standard subscription that comes with several other handy features (that are also included with the Complete plan). Aside from live monitoring, the Smart Security service can remind you to arm or disarm your house by using Wi-Fi and geofencing data to determine when you’re home. It will also send a notification to your phone when a door opens unexpectedly — Ecobee says that its system can tell the difference between your family members and an intruder, so you shouldn’t expect unnecessary notifications. You can check out the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-security%2F%23Compare-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772336%2Fecobee-smart-security-professionally-monitored-security-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full list of Smart Security features on Ecobee’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gQDj"&gt;As far as privacy goes, Ecobee says that it “will never sell or misuse your data” and that it uses “extra security layers like two-factor authentication so your account is secure.” Ecobee also notes that its SmartCamera switches off when it detects that you and your family are home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpXAl4"&gt;If you don’t want to commit to $10 / month just yet, Ecobee is offering a free two-month trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUS9Kz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:00 PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to clarify that the products within Ecobee’s Efficiency and Security Solution bundle are required to use the Smart Security service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FuboTV crosses 1 million subscribers six years after launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmPmMdKC0ijJsp8R6F9esJ369Xk=/0x15:1844x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118913/Screen_Shot_2021_11_09_at_5.00.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FuboTV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mmt4Ek"&gt;Sports-focused streaming TV service FuboTV has surpassed 1 million subscribers, the company announced today. The news came as part of FuboTV’s &lt;a href="https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Reaches-One-Million-Subscribers/default.aspx"&gt;third-quarter financial earnings report&lt;/a&gt;: it ended Q3 with 944,605 subscribers but crossed the million figure after the quarter closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXveNr"&gt;“FuboTV’s achievement of hitting the 1 million subscriber mark since the third quarter ended is an extraordinary milestone by any measure but particularly remarkable given the momentum of our business over six short years,” said co-founder and CEO David Gandler. FuboTV is also highlighting its growth in revenue, advertising earnings, and viewing hours. The latter reached 284 million hours of streamed content during the quarter, up 113 percent year over year. In his letter to shareholders, Gandler said, “1 million subscribers means increased relevance, leverage and influence with content partners and leagues, and the opportunity to go upstream on tentpole sports properties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4cfKV"&gt;“To put this in perspective, as of the end of the second quarter 2020, we had approximately 286,000 subscribers,” Gandler added. “And, even at the one million subscriber mark, we believe we are still just scratching the surface of the massive opportunity ahead of us with 72.6 million subscribers still active on traditional pay television.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyIbnl"&gt;Still, that FuboTV is just now hitting the all-important 1 million milestone shows how hard it can be to compete with streaming heavyweights and larger TV-centric services, like YouTube TV, Sling TV, and Hulu with Live TV. Rich Greenfield of &lt;a href="https://lightshedtmt.com/2021/09/27/is-comcasts-nbcu-fighting-a-losing-battle-with-googles-youtube-tv-the-industrys-largest-vmpvd/"&gt;LightShed Partners&lt;/a&gt; recently estimated that YouTube TV has around 4 million subscribers, making it the largest internet TV provider in the United States, followed closely by Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci9w4A"&gt;FuboTV’s channel bundles &lt;a href="https://www.fubo.tv/welcome?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome%3Futm_source%3Dcommercial%26utm_keyword%3DTV%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3DTV%26ftv_campaign%3DTV&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;start at $64.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;, which includes 116 channels, 250 hours of cloud DVR storage, and three concurrent streams. The top-tier Elite package increases that to 162 channels, 1,000 hours of DVR space, and 10 simultaneous streams. That starting price is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;the same as YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; after the Google-owned service sharply raised its subscription rate in June of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVz68"&gt;FuboTV also announced that it’s acquiring Molotov SAS, described as “France’s number one live TV streaming company,” and Edisn.ai, an AI company that specializes in video recognition. FuboTV says its tech will be used for “interactive experiences, personalization and platform stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse’s new CEO admits the startup’s electric van is no workhorse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rK9kAKpWsUB8IDcekXAF_wHBbxk=/0x67:1600x1134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118518/E3nZHe_XMAED9jF.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Workhorse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyh33T"&gt;The new CEO of struggling EV startup Workhorse admitted Tuesday that he’s not sure the company’s C-1000 electric van can stand up to the kind of punishing work required by delivery companies. In other words, Workhorse’s EV isn’t a workhorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYsdV8"&gt;“As I’ve talked to the big customers at UPS, FedEx, others, they expect to have these trucks last 15 to 20 years and go 15 to 20,000 miles a year and carry up to seven or 8,000 pounds of payload,” CEO Rick Dauch said during a revealing conference call about the company’s &lt;a href="https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/185/workhorse-group-reports-third-quarter-2021-results"&gt;third-quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m pretty darn sure the C-1000 can’t meet those kind of stringent requirements. Okay? That’s the bad news.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oLd2L"&gt;More bad news? Not only does Workhorse have to redesign its flagship C-1000 delivery vehicle, but Dauch also said it might not be possible to salvage the van as a mass-production product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpKHWE"&gt;The good news, Dauch said, is that prospective customers have told him they will take “every C-1000 [Workhorse] can build in 2022 so they can start demonstrating to their teams and their customers in the field how an EV vehicle works versus an [internal combustion] vehicle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NLZAb4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m pretty darn sure the C-1000 can’t meet those kind of stringent requirements.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iKirqW"&gt;Dauch believes there’s a lot of room for large electric commercial vehicles like the ones Workhorse has been developing — and, in fact, he said Tuesday that he’s been working with his new executive team to draft a refreshed product roadmap — but its best bet in the near term may be to sell demonstration vehicles to these apparently eager buyers. He said Workhorse has enough supplies on hand to build “somewhere north of 500 vehicles” in 2022 before it would need to bring in any new raw material. But even that’s only if Workhorse is able to fix the C-1000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9f26m"&gt;“If we can look each other in the eyes, and we can pass every single test, and we can make the modifications on the vehicles we’ve already built, and we can make those design changes on the next vehicles we build, then yes, we could probably do that, but we haven’t made that decision yet,” Dauch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgZ645"&gt;Still, he said, “we are a real company and not a PowerPoint EV company,” as he guided investors through the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDpV9v"&gt;Dauch took over as CEO of Workhorse in July, at a time when the EV startup was in disarray. It was racing to ship electric delivery vehicles that we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;weren’t compliant with federal safety standards&lt;/a&gt;. It was building those vehicles with parts bought through online auctions and flown in from Asia, cementing their money-losing status. Even the factory in Union City, Indiana was surrounded by debris and unpaved roads, Dauch said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJWrHu"&gt;But now Dauch, who came from automotive supplier Delphi, has detailed a corporate exorcism he believes can save the struggling startup. He cleaned house at the leadership level. He recalled the unprofitable, non-compliant vehicles. He scuttled the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675630/workhorse-usps-mail-truck-bid-protest-dropped-oshkosh"&gt;costly legal fight over the lost bid to build the next-generation mail truck for the US Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;. He even paved the roads at the Union City plant. And now he wants Workhorse to “pioneer the transition to zero emission commercial vehicles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZofCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup faces twin investigations by the SEC and DOJ&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgSUKM"&gt;“We’re taking the sometimes painful but necessary early steps to reshape our company to become a more focused and capable industry leader in the EV space,” Dauch said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvLeU5"&gt;Surviving, let alone leading, will be a challenge. Workhorse confirmed this week that it’s under investigation from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765287/doj-investigation-ev-workhorse-accounting-fraud-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;regarding allegations of fraud&lt;/a&gt;. (The company says it’s cooperating with the probes.) Workhorse has to navigate all of this while massive players like General Motors and Ford and well-funded startups like Arrival and Rivian push into the commercial EV space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiOmOr"&gt;One “painful” step Dauch described Tuesday was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;recalling all 41 of the C-1000s that Workhorse had delivered this year&lt;/a&gt; — a decision that cost the company at least $1.1 million in the short term, leaving it with &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; $576,000 in revenue for the quarter. (Workhorse posted an $81 million loss overall and has $230 million in the bank.) “Our current C-1000 vehicle design is not robust, nor is it profitable,” Dauch said on the call.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2IQcY"&gt;But the decision was necessary for two reasons, he explained. Most importantly, the C-1000s that went out to customers this year were not compliant with multiple Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Certain parts of the electronics were not up to snuff. Neither were the windshield wipers and defogging system nor the lamps and reflective safety devices.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CMArn"&gt;“As a new startup company, we just weren’t experienced enough [around] some of the regulations and standards that we need to hold ourselves accountable to under FMVSS,” he said. While he expects Workhorse to be done putting the C-1000 through new testing by the end of the year, Dauch said he won’t put the van back on the road if it’s not safe. “I’m not going to jeopardize anybody’s life or any family’s lives on the road.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PxYtWr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dauch said the previous leadership team’s spending was “almost ludicrous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRjCAv"&gt;Another “painful” step Dauch described Tuesday was cleaning shop at the executive and vice president level. That, too, was costly for the startup. Workhorse’s general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $4.6 million higher than compared to last year, in part because of severance packages for the people who got Workhorse into its current mess, including the former CEO, CFO, and vice president of finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rChZRS"&gt;Dispatching that team opened up room for Dauch to hire his own staff. He touted seven of them on the call, all men, most of whom have deep backgrounds in the automotive or related industries. And he said it would be up to them (and him) to rebuild Workhorse’s supply chain, retain customers while courting new ones, and chart a new course for the company’s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi7vj6"&gt;Dauch has made at least one decision since taking over that didn’t sound painful: abandoning the company’s lawsuit against the government, which it filed after it lost the contest to build the Postal Service’s next-generation mail truck. Workhorse was spending “a hell of a lot of money” on outside consultants, legal firms, and lobbying groups, Dauch said. In fact, he said Workhorse’s previous leadership team had been paying “five times more” for consultants than it would have been paying in-house employees for similar roles. “That’s just, like, almost ludicrous.” &lt;/p&gt;
