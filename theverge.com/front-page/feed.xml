    <title>Apple MagSafe Battery Pack review: convenience over capacity</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Perfectly designed for the iPhone, but not a lot of charge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mv1rms"&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack is a white rectangle you can stick to the back of an iPhone 12 to charge it. It’s Apple’s third run at designing an external battery solution for the iPhone and I like it better than the earlier battery cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exfu7u"&gt;However, anybody considering spending $99 on this battery ought to keep one important fact in mind: even Apple cannot break the laws of physics. It is just as bound by the same rules of magnetism and electrons as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOZZHa"&gt;Those laws require tradeoffs: A battery that could fully charge up most iPhone 12 models would be big. A battery small enough to not look odd on a phone wouldn’t have enough juice. Plus, electrons can only flow so fast without building up heat and degrading the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="35Ynq9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple can’t defeat the laws of physics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZnHT6"&gt;Apple found a balance between all those extremes and it maintains that balance with a tight software integration that aggressively manages how this battery charges your phone. The result is a gadget that’s singularly focused on the iPhone — sometimes to its own detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPVBma"&gt;The best part about the MagSafe Battery is that it also serves as a fast-charging wireless MagSafe puck when it’s plugged in. So the big question is whether all that is enough to justify the price, especially compared to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IkVgoJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10664255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CY6cYp"&gt;The MagSafe Battery doesn’t have enough energy to fully charge an iPhone 12 Mini from zero to 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDUiI9"&gt;In my testing, the MagSafe Battery was fully drained when my iPhone 12 Mini reached 83 percent, which took 130 minutes of charging. I didn’t have it plugged in for this test, which meant it charged at a relatively pokey 5W speed, so as to minimize heat and maximize the battery’s longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJY99r"&gt;I used the iPhone very sporadically during the charging period (mostly to record the results every 15 minutes), though I did listen to a 15-minute podcast over Bluetooth which slowed the charging down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MSIBi"&gt;Bottom line: it’s a small battery and it will help you top up your iPhone, not fully charge it. On larger iPhone 12 models, it won’t even hit that 83 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="3oG47H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It performs better than its 1,460mAh rating would suggest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHfQPO9Akof4nKcvPy2tOkdDU2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733362/DSC02778_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGKgdGSoVtUCmkvmzsTidUJvvb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733367/DSC02789_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTf0Fe"&gt;There is a discussion to have about what the right way to talk about battery size is. The MagSafe Battery only has a 1,460mAh battery, but that number isn’t comparable to other batteries because it can push through more volts (7.62V). So the MagSafe Battery’s rated 11.13Wh (Watt-hours) is the number that actually matters. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TW7BRTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker makes a 5,000mAh battery with wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; and magnets for under $50. It’s rated at 18.5Wh, so the differences are smaller than they first appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5jxgt"&gt;The battery measurement discussion is interesting, but it doesn’t change the fact that the MagSafe Battery is simply small. It’s meant to be pocketable and easy to carry, and so you should think of it as something that can stretch your battery life just a little — not get you through multiple days away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10L4qZ"&gt;As you might expect, the software experience with the MagSafe Battery is tightly integrated into the iPhone. There are big animations that show the charge of both your phone and the battery when you attach it. It shows up on the battery level widget, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0D1sYM"&gt;More interestingly, when you first attach the battery, your iPhone will pop up a notice that this battery won’t charge your phone above 90 percent — by design. Those last few percentage points put a lot of stress on batteries, and in this context it’s just not worth it. I think it’s a smart move, but if you absolutely want that last 10 percent, you can long press the battery icon in the Control Center and tell it to charge past 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpqMfamewmQtoxQWS4fzM2o6JSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733391/DSC02736_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2C2x6Q9ZfJwS723cnSduTH_uyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733395/DSC02737_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkVmQo"&gt;I know this sounds both complicated and disappointing, but in use it’s actually the opposite. I would just slap the battery on the back of my phone when I was worried about battery life and didn’t sweat the details. The result was not needing to keep an eye on battery life as much as I usually do. It’s elegant instead of powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I63fDm"&gt;That’s all smart, but it only happens with the iPhone. It is certainly a nicer overall experience than you’d get with the Anker battery, which is thicker to boot. But the Anker has other advantages. Its battery is bigger, for one thing. It also has a USB-C port on it that both takes charge when plugged in &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; can be used to charge devices via a wire. It’s less elegant for iPhone users, but it’s much more versatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brd6xx"&gt;The Lightning port on the bottom of the MagSafe Battery means iPhone users can keep using the same charging cable, so it’s probably the right call to keep it. It’s just too bad that Lightning can’t charge in either direction like a USB-C port can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtsqaOrbK1sEKzSO_o-PStYZwqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733335/DSC02729_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="klt8W8"&gt;The MagSafe Battery is designed to match the dimensions of the iPhone 12 Mini perfectly. It aligns exactly to the edges and is more comfortable to hold than I expected. If you have a larger iPhone, it will sit on the back a bit more awkwardly — it looks positively tiny on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="OC1jUe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every battery pack looks silly attached to a phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qN3kfAlg7EpFcCtrEkA3jsg5da4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733380/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yuxtv"&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1417548597785202689"&gt;polled Twitter for questions&lt;/a&gt; about the battery and I was taken aback by the vitriol I saw in my replies — and elsewhere. It’s easy to make fun of how a battery pack looks on the back of a phone. It’s also easy to go after it for not providing enough charge. Having used it, I’m not sure I’d want it any larger and I certainly wouldn’t want it any smaller. To me, there’s no such thing as a good-looking external battery. At the end of the day, they’re all squarish or oblong hunks of plastic or metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yodY2M"&gt;The white plastic has a matte finish that helps a little with grip, but I wouldn’t call it soft touch. I do wonder if it’ll pick up stains from blue jeans over time, but in the few days I’ve been testing it, it’s remained clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJkFgB"&gt;It snaps on the back of a caseless iPhone with a satisfying snick. It’s as secure as I think can be fairly expected from something connected with magnets. It’d be nice if the alignment magnet was a little stronger, but I am glad that my iPhone doesn’t contain magnets so strong that it messes with credit cards. Physics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gnySp"&gt;You can intentionally shake off the battery or have it slip off when putting it in your pocket, but I didn’t have those problems. However, if you are planning on using it with a case, you absolutely need a MagSafe compatible case that itself has magnets on it. I use a very thin plastic case and that minimal layer was more than enough to stop the magnets from working effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2O_OrQpi14EUvmfjoI85z4PHeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733340/DSC02781_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q6FsGU"&gt;After two days testing a couple different MagSafe Batteries on both an iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max, I came to a surprising conclusion. My favorite part isn’t the battery, it’s the MagSafe charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4oeA8"&gt;When I think of the MagSafe Battery as a MagSafe charging puck that just happens to have a battery attached to it, I think it makes a little more sense as a product. Apple’s MagSafe puck costs $40 — that certainly doesn’t make the $99 asking price for this battery a deal, but it might be worth buying the battery instead of the puck for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEKKns"&gt;I do have to point out that for $99 I would have expected Apple to at least include a Lightning cable. It doesn’t, nor does it include a charging brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyPkVs"&gt;When plugged into a powerful enough wall charger, the MagSafe Battery can charge the phone at up to 15W, just like the standard MagSafe disc. The charger can fill up both itself and your iPhone. If you want to prioritize charging speed on the iPhone, you can plug &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; in instead and then the iPhone will use reverse wireless charging to top up the battery. (Unfortunately and unlike Android phones, the iPhone’s reverse wireless charging doesn’t work for other devices, like AirPods.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-CjsYo_ztMxG5Gs0F81pBS-1Azg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733349/DSC02759_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p4evuG"&gt;The MagSafe Battery’s best feature is that it is a good MagSafe wireless charger. It’s also a decent battery — but only if you think of it as a small extender, one that trades longevity for size. Do I wish it had more capacity? Of course. I also wish it could have more capacity without getting any larger than it already is. I don’t begrudge physics and I get why Apple chose the size it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Sk8y9b"&gt;But paying $99 for all the MagSafe Battery’s elegance and integration doesn’t make sense when there are much cheaper options that are less beholden to working with just one phone. A battery pack is going to look silly no matter what, you might as well get one that’s as versatile as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93IP0G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MbIiO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MagSafe Battery Pack teardown confirms dual-cell design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9rYSCHC435mwbloA9qNNcfMKdA=/1x0:2149x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621406/J4hYWZ4XRA.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo" target="_blank"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zWfE7C"&gt;A teardown of Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;$99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt; has given us our best look yet inside the new accessory, and revealed more details about how it works. For starters, it confirms recent speculation that it uses a pair of battery cells wired in series like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F34004%2Fthis-x-ray-teardown-really-smarts-iphone-11-smart-battery-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F23%2F22590033%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack-teardown-dual-cell-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s previous Smart Battery cases&lt;/a&gt;, but it also gives us a look at the NFC circuitry and heat shielding within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DguWsG"&gt;A dual-cell design is important, because it allows the voltage of the battery pack to be higher than a comparable single-cell design. While each individual cell is labelled as being 3.82 volts, the overall voltage of the battery pack is 7.62 with them wired in series. It means the pack should be capable of supplying more power than its 1,460mAh capacity would suggest when compared directly with the battery capacities of the iPhone itself, with a total power output of 11.13Wh. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/14/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-has-more-capacity-than-it-seems---heres-why"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt; has a good writeup&lt;/a&gt; of the science if you’re after more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TC4HBNfTLHpeD7OPmXiGfNZMv0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735219/J4hYWZ4XRA.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo" target="_blank"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dual-cell design of the MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3qrhmO"&gt;Beyond the battery cells, the teardown gives us a good look at how the battery pack dissipates heat. In February, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22290938/apple-magsafe-iphone-battery-pack-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; the existence of the pack, it noted that development had been set back because the iPhone’s software kept thinking the accessory was overheating. It’s unclear if this problem was overcome with software or hardware fixes, but clearly a lot of effort has gone into keeping the pack cool while allowing it to supply enough power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61wG0z"&gt;Unlike the right-to-repair advocates over at iFixit, Charger Lab doesn’t offer a repairability score at the end of its teardowns. But the amount of adhesive and concealed tabs holding the battery pack together don’t make it look very user serviceable. We’ll have more details on how it performs in practice in our forthcoming review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arm’s cheap and flexible plastic microchip could create an ‘internet of everything’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdthMNgd2zLNwWscUQPClfIr-KM=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621310/pragmatic_arm_plasticarm_plastic_chip_flexible.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plastic chips would be flexible and cheap; meaning they could be printed pretty much anywhere. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: PragmatIC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jnb2rP"&gt;If you think microchips are ubiquitous now, appearing in everything from washing machines to lampposts, just wait until circuits can be printed onto plastic, paper, and fabric for the price of pennies. That’s what chip designer Arm is promising, with the company this week unveiling a new prototype &lt;a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/research/b/articles/posts/plasticarm-realising-the-full-potential-of-the-internet-of-things?"&gt;plastic-based microchip named PlasticARM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBhdBK"&gt;This isn’t the first flexible chip we’ve seen, but it is the most complex. PlasticARM contains a 32-bit Cortex-M0 CPU (the cheapest and simplest processor core in Arm’s Cortex-M family), as well as 456 bytes of ROM and 128 bytes of RAM. It’s comprised of over 18,000 logic gates, which Arm says is at least 12 times more than the previous plastic-based chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKcUYg"&gt;The chip was designed in coordination with flexible electronics maker PragmatIC, and as the company’s designers explain in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03625-w"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t yet have the same functionality of silicon-based designs. For example, it’s only capable of running a trio of test programs hardwired into its circuits during fabrication, though Arm’s researchers say they’re working on future versions that will allow new code to be installed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KJMwIPh47KQ_T18v08MDmAogsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735203/plasticarm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arm&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arm’s PlasticARM chip isn’t the fastest or most efficient, but it is the most flexible. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O2EsHY"&gt;What makes PlasticARM and similar chips so special is their use of flexible components; in this case, metal-oxide thin-film transistors or TFTs. These can be printed onto surfaces that bend and flex without degrading, unlike processors based on brittle silicon substrates. This makes it possible to cheaply print processors onto materials like plastic and paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5jmJ5"&gt;As Arm’s researchers explain in their paper, this would allow microchips to be put to all sorts of uses that would seem wasteful today. You might have chips printed into every milk bottle for example that detect spoilage, replacing the use of sell-by-dates. Arm says this will create a new “internet of everything,” with chips integrated into “more than a trillion inanimate objects over the next decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FE9v4g"&gt;Plastic-based chips have major drawbacks, though, and will certainly not replace silicon processors in the short term. They’re simply too inefficient in terms energy consumption, density, and performance. PlasticARM consumes 21 milliwatts of power, for example, but 99 percent of that is essentially wasted, with only 1 percent captured for computation. The chip is also comparatively large, with an area of 59.2 square millimeters. As noted by &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16837/plasticarm-get-your-next-cpu-without-silicon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that’s around 1,500 times the size of a silicon-based Cortex M0 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIbAKu"&gt;As Arm research engineer James Myers &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2284533-flexible-computer-processor-is-the-most-powerful-plastic-chip-yet/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “It won’t be fast, it won’t be energy efficient, but if I’m going to put it on a lettuce to track shelf life, that’s the idea.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MacBook Air with 13-inch Mini LED display reportedly on the way for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ImFNZq"&gt;Apple plans to announce a redesigned MacBook Air with a 13.3-inch Mini LED display in the middle of 2022, according to a new investor note from reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/22/kuo-apple-to-announce-new-macbook-air-with-13-inch-mini-led-display-in-mid-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/mini-led-macbook-air-mid-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The prediction is in line with Kuo’s &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-macbook-air-mini-led-2020-launch/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt;, but offers a more specific timeframe. It also suggests the new Air will have a slightly smaller display than the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros that are said to be on the way this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWwrr6"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new display technology that’s designed to offer some of the benefits of OLED — such as better contrast levels and improved dynamic range — without the risks of burn-in. It made its Apple debut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;on this year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo has previously listed around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163328/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-imac-ipad-pro-mini-led-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;half a dozen Apple devices&lt;/a&gt; scheduled to migrate to the new displays, including a 27-inch iMac Pro, 14.1-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, 10.2 iPad, and 7.9-inch iPad Mini. Apple is able to include the more premium displays because of cost-savings associated with using its own silicon, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/"&gt;according to Kuo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hKFOye"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new display, alongside MagSafe charging and a more powerful processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tQM0F2"&gt;Alongside the new display technology, the upcoming MacBook Air will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;reportedly feature  MagSafe charging&lt;/a&gt;, a thinner and lighter design, as well as two USB 4 ports. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the new Air will be powered by a “direct successor” to this year’s M1 processor. The new chip is said to include the same number of CPU cores, running at faster speeds, and an increased number of GPU cores. The current M1 processor is available with seven or eight GPU cores, while the new model will reportedly include nine or 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AesMuF"&gt;The new MacBook Air is likely to follow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revamped MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, due to arrive in the third quarter of this year. The laptops will reportedly be available with 14 or 16-inch displays (Mini LED, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/09/kuo-redesigned-macbook-pro-coming-later-this-year-with-mini-led-macbook-air-with-new-display-in-2022/"&gt;according to Kuo&lt;/a&gt;) with a new, more squared off design. MagSafe charging, HDMI ports, and SD card slots, are also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;said to be included&lt;/a&gt;. The MacBook Pro’s much derided OLED touch bar, could also finally be dropped with these models.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM’s Super Cruise getting fully automatic, hands-free lane changes and more for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NtI58S7AT2gDrUEVrpNsjb0CPOs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69620839/2022_GMC_Sierra_Super_Cruise_Trailering_and_Automoatic_Lane_Change.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yIWT3A"&gt;General Motors’ Super Cruise, one of the best advanced driver assist systems on the market, is getting a big upgrade for 2022 and will be available on way more vehicles — including, for the first time, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra half-ton pickup trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYTLyO"&gt;To test out the new stuff, GMC had me out to GM’s Milford Proving Grounds to play with the new Super Cruise on the facility’s 4.5-mile banked circle track. Security at the facility is tight and our cameras were either confiscated or, in the case of my iPhone, covered in obnoxious red security tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnByMm"&gt;I soon understood the need for security when I spotted what appeared to be the upcoming 2023 Z06 mid-engined Corvette being tested, a whole bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV pickups&lt;/a&gt; and, curiously, a Tesla Model Y. (GMC wouldn’t say why, but I assume it was to check out the competition.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8KfOw3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Available for the first time in the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dz7JBF"&gt;There are three main new capabilities to the 2022 variant of Super Cruise, and I got to test two of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jRxRDJ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fully automatic lane changes&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning the car can determine when it’s safe to pass a slower car in front of you and execute all lane changes without involving the driver at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="71PliN"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Support for towing&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for hands-free trailering (but you can’t tow &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have automatic lane changes, it’s one or the other).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tpYK4b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrades to the navigation, to show Super Cruise-enabled roads on the in-vehicle navigation system during route selection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="S2dpv4"&gt;I took the Sierra out onto the facility’s “highway” and a GM engineer followed in a chase car. After setting Super Cruise to 70mph, I settled in for a nice hands-free drive in a large circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAtrb5"&gt;Super Cruise, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/10/15224516/cadillac-super-cruise-hands-free-ct6-tesla-autopilot"&gt;debuted in 2017 in the Cadillac CT6 sedan&lt;/a&gt;, is capable of completely hands-free driving across more than 200,000 miles of divided highway across North America. It compares the vehicle’s position, taken from both GPS and on-board cameras, to its location in a lidar scan of the world. Once the vehicle knows where it is, and that it’s safe to activate, Super Cruise will take over both steering and acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="itPlAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The driver is still required to pay full attention&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wirslw"&gt;The driver is still required to pay full attention. The car uses an infrared vision system to ensure that the driver’s eyes remain on the road. Look away at your smartphone for too long and the system starts with warnings before disengaging entirely. But if you keep your eyes on the road, you won’t need to touch the steering wheel at all unless there’s a situation the system can’t handle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lBb-OnIr2Y_it-NbAUpYzyT90Sk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734129/super_cruise_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FzPtle"&gt;And with the updates, you’ll be able to touch the wheel even less. After I pulled onto the highway and set my speed, the chase car sped past, moved into my lane, and then slowed down to less than 70mph. My Sierra noticed this and slowed down to match, but then it began scanning the left-hand passing lane to see if it was safe to move over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deDoFJ"&gt;After a moment, the car beeped at me and popped up a message warning of the impending lane change and the vehicle swiftly moved to the left lane while simultaneously accelerating back up to my 70mph set speed. It wasn’t a dramatic move, but it was impressive to watch it in action. After passing the slower car, it moved back into the right lane and continued on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpJTHV"&gt;The truck has four new wide-angle, long-range radar sensors to support the system, one on each corner of the vehicle. GM upgraded the two existing rear / side radars that were there to enable existing blind-spot monitoring features. The existing long-range radar for the adaptive cruise system is carried over. Between the seven different radar sensors, the car has 360-degree long-range coverage of the world around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UpW1nr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Between the seven different radar sensors, the car has 360-degree long-range coverage of the world around it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1a8UnM"&gt;2021 Cadillac Escalade models have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111495/cadillac-super-cruise-automatic-lane-change-gm-update"&gt;older version of the lane change system&lt;/a&gt; where the car would change lanes if the driver activated the turn signal (though it didn’t require any interaction with the steering wheel), but this is a significant improvement on that. Just keep an eye on the road, and the car should be able to move around slower cars and trucks in your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTkZUD"&gt;The new trailering option is more complicated than it might appear at first glance. When you attach a trailer for the first time, the truck asks a series of questions like how long the trailer is. This helps the truck calculate the total length and weight of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0ld0v"&gt;While in a normal curve, Super Cruise will stay closer to the inside lane line, which is how most humans drive. With the trailer attached, Super Cruise will instead work to keep the vehicle and trailer dead center in the lane. It’ll also leave more space between you and a vehicle in front (since the truck and trailer will take longer to slow down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wg9LVp"&gt;All versions of Super Cruise use mapping data to determine if it should slow down for an upcoming curve. But it will be more conservative with a trailer attached, slowing down sooner and to a lower speed than without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qH7sB"&gt;A Sierra can haul 10,000 pounds without breaking a sweat, and that’s a significant amount of weight to entrust to the computer, but GMC’s engineers say it really works. In my 15-minute demo, I’m inclined to agree with them — though it was the definition of a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aZjeux"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“democratization of technology”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nDUjM"&gt;Company reps wouldn’t specify pricing nor what trim levels on which Super Cruise will be available. Phil Brook, GMC’s VP of marketing, said the addition of Super Cruise to Sierra was a “democratization of technology” and that they didn’t want to keep it buried at exclusively high trim levels. We’ll see about that, but expect Super Cruise to be an expensive option either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llEDjT"&gt;GM says the new Super Cruise will be available on a number of different vehicles, including the upcoming GMC Hummer electric pickup, the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups, the Cadillac Escalade and XT6 SUVs, and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans. The 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV will receive an older version of Super Cruise that doesn’t include the lane change features. Owners of 2021 Escalade vehicles with Super Cruise equipped will also receive the new features in a future over-the-air update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pK6JZK"&gt;Of course, this was a contrived test on GM’s own test track. But, given the performance of Super Cruise in our own real-world testing and the company’s conservative, take-it-slow approach to rolling out the feature across its lineup, we expect the new features to work as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDY9Ay"&gt;None too soon, either. Arch rival Ford is planning to unleash its own hands-free Level 2 driving system, BlueCruise, later this year starting in 2021 versions of the Ford F-150 pickup and the Mustang Mach-E electric car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j4Pmy"&gt;And, of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18065540/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot-model-3-test-drive"&gt;Tesla’s Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; and the new beta version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570081/tesla-fsd-v9-beta-autopilot-update"&gt;Full Self Driving features&lt;/a&gt; which also support automatic lane changes on the highway. However, the Tesla system requires the driver to keep their hands on the steering wheel to confirm that they’re paying attention instead of the completely hands-free driving that the camera-based driver monitoring systems from Ford and GM allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwqyIm"&gt;Though both Super Cruise and Autopilot have been around for a while, they haven’t been available in any pickup trucks — by far the most popular vehicles in America. The addition of Super Cruise to the Silverado and Sierra, and BlueCruise to the F-150, will bring these technologies (which might be old hat to Tesla owners) to an entirely new market of flyover truck buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etU3rl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19kfgY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>19 days after REvil’s ransomware attack on Kaseya VSA systems, there’s a fix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQoaKsq_WjCjakmuGxtITv_tgno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69620454/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ha4nVW"&gt;Just ahead of the July 4th holiday weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;a ransomware attack targeted organizations using Kaseya VSA remote management software&lt;/a&gt;. The outfit behind the attack, REvil, initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"&gt;requested a $70 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; and claimed to have locked down millions of devices. That was before REvil suddenly went offline on July 13th, disconnecting its servers, abandoning forums, and shutting down a page on the dark web used to communicate with victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcAOKF"&gt;Now, Kaseya &lt;a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/"&gt;says it has obtained a universal decryptor&lt;/a&gt; from a “third party” that can restore data encrypted during the attack. The company has not said how it came by this technology, telling &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-obtains-universal-decryptor-for-revil-ransomware-victims/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it could not confirm or deny any ransom payment had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7TCWGm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ransomware funds more ransomware, so how do we stop it?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564054/ransomware-revil-kaseya-coop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7qjRxU"&gt;On 7/21/2021, Kaseya obtained a decryptor for victims of the REvil ransomware attack, and we’re working to remediate customers impacted by the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApLpj4"&gt;We can confirm that Kaseya obtained the tool from a third party and have teams actively helping customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments, with no reports of any problem or issues associated with the decryptor. Kaseya is working with &lt;a href="https://www.emsisoft.com/"&gt;Emsisoft&lt;/a&gt; to support our customer engagement efforts, and Emsisoft has confirmed the key is effective at unlocking victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="trlXO1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reporter Kevin Collier first reported the decryption tool’s existence and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevincollier/status/1418326065265664022"&gt;speculates&lt;/a&gt; that one of three sources is likely behind the key: the US government, the Russian government, or a ransom payment to the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2JsfU"&gt;Kaseya says cybersecurity firm Emsisoft confirmed the restoration tool is “effective,” and now it’s working with victims of the attack to decrypt affected systems. It’s unknown how much help the tool will offer, coming several weeks after the attacks, but it’s better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUiGat"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad could not resist draping the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack in leather </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eR8Yv5PA_p3D1OzappSnyxCJIVM=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619953/nomad_magsafe_battery_pack_leather_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hYIuno"&gt;Frankly, now that we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/7/22563631/nomad-magsafe-leather-cover-charger-price"&gt;a leather case for your MagSafe charging puck&lt;/a&gt;, it’s all uphill from here. At least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/7/19/22583859/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-thickness-size-shape-plastic"&gt;Apple’s new $99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; is something you’ll actually be carrying around and touching on a regular basis, where leather might make it nicer to hold. Perhaps you already have a matching leather case for your iPhone, too? It looks like a nice combo in photos. If you agree, Nomad is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-cover-for-magsafe-battery-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently taking preorders for $30 each&lt;/a&gt;, shipping this November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6ofoO"&gt;(I blame Apple for only releasing the battery in white.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/shkPUKFfkxBYxDHpPmak3RWgBkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734484/nomad_leather_case_magsafe_battery.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8yOFGK"&gt;While you can’t see it in pictures or the description, Nomad tells us it will actually have a hole for the battery’s charging port. One more note: while microsuction tape is much better (reusable, no sticky residue) compared to your traditional Scotch, you should probably know tape is what’s keeping this piece of leather on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbYpln"&gt;I think I’ll wait and see how strong the MagSafe Battery Pack’s magnets are, period, before I put any more leather on a phone. Stay tuned: Dieter’s currently working on that review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0zI4G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Nomad’s confirmation that it will have a cut-out for the MagSafe Battery Pack’s charging port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Old Vidme embeds turn into a hub of porn after domain purchase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g3qmfo"&gt;Here’s (yet another) argument against using third-party embeds on your respectable website: Porn company 5 Star HD Porn bought the expired domain for video hosting site Vidme, which went &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/vidme-shuts-down-video-app-1202628367/"&gt;out of business in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any websites with Vidme embeds now have porn on them. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8xz3/a-defunct-video-hosting-site-is-flooding-normal-websites-with-hardcore-porn"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported the story first, the list of websites with unexpected porn embeds includes &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine, &lt;/em&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt;, and others. And yes, we discovered one such embed on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and have since disabled it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2oEWMi18UCa2C2f0qY50bA1pJEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734411/bad_vid_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Old Vidme embeds now redirect to a porn site&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wx179d"&gt;It’s a very extreme example of link rot, which is what happens when online content or images are deleted or otherwise broken, so the links don’t point back to their original targets. We saw another widespread example of this after former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;President Trump was banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in January after inciting a riot at the Capitol. The thousands of tweets the former president sent out over the years he was on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222371/trump-ban-twitter-link-rot-embedded-dead-posts"&gt;Twitter were wiped out,&lt;/a&gt; and any embeds of the tweets now display as empty gray boxes. Some of the former president’s tweets must be preserved under the Presidential Records Act (which predates Twitter by more than four decades), and there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/"&gt;sortable archive of most of his tweets&lt;/a&gt; built by an independent developer, so his tweets haven’t totally disappeared from the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNih4t"&gt;Most social media platforms have enabled embeds of their content; Twitter activated embeds in 2012, and Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram all allow some version of embeds as well. Reddit has an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/embeds"&gt;option&lt;/a&gt; on its embedded content which allows users to have them blanked out if the post is edited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZnlGj"&gt;Used correctly, embedded content can help illustrate a blog post or news item online, and provide a layer of credibility. But when links go bad, as they apparently have in the Vidme case, it can be a serious headache to deal with thousands of embeds that don’t go where they’re supposed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D24psI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel teases plan to speed up chip advancements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vy7C82epLts_0TD0z7wywMN8hJ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619549/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xhlqpd"&gt;Intel has struggled recently with getting its more advanced chip architectures out the door, but that might be changing soon. CEO Pat Gelsinger announced today on Intel’s Q2 earnings call that “7nm is progressing well,” and the company is gearing up to announce news on how its “accelerating its annual cadence of innovation with new advancements in semiconductor process and packaging,” at a webcast on Monday, July 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWrSVm"&gt;The announcement comes alongside &lt;a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_dc76b93ec01daad27a346504a3ae6e82/intel/db/887/8685/earnings_presentation/Q2_2021_Earnings_Presentation.pdf"&gt;Intel’s Q2 earnings&lt;/a&gt;, where the semiconductor company &lt;a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_dc76b93ec01daad27a346504a3ae6e82/intel/news/2021-07-22_Intel_Reports_Second_Quarter_2021_Financial_1485.pdf"&gt;managed to beat expectations&lt;/a&gt; and bring in $18.2 billion in revenue, up 2 percent year-over-year. Intel is feeling pretty optimistic about the future, too. It raised its 2021 outlook by an additional $1 billion to $73.5 billion, and now expects to achieve revenue growth year-over-year compared to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iN6xzD"&gt;Intel’s earnings have been trending upwards for the past several quarters, despite its frequent delays and misses on production of both its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/27/17291040/intel-10nm-cannon-lake-chips-delayed-2019-cpu-processor"&gt;10nm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;7nm chips&lt;/a&gt;. That growth has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;buoyed by spikes in demand&lt;/a&gt; for both personal computers and data-center chips in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw millions buy new laptops and computers to aid in remote work and education and an increased reliance on cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uE4vV"&gt;And Intel seems to still be riding that wave, recording $10.1 billion in revenue for its client computing group (up 6 percent year over year, and a Q2 record for the company), despite the global semiconductor shortage. Gelsinger commented during the call that he “expect[s] the shortages to bottom out in the second half [of the year, but] it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgrIkI"&gt;The boost for the client computing group also helped Intel make up for slower revenue from its data center group, which was down 9 percent year-over-year with $6.5 billion in revenue. There’s signs that that the impressive growth for the PC segment is starting to slow, however: both IDC and Gartner noted that growth of PC sales has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;slowed down considerably in Q2&lt;/a&gt;, which could indicate that the boost in sales there will diminish in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KrCX0F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel’s next-gen 7nm chips are delayed until at least 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"},{"title":"Intel’s hardware chief is leaving the company","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340993/intel-hardware-chief-venkata-murthy-renduchintala-leaving"},{"title":"Intel is replacing its CEO, Bob Swan","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fDE9Oi"&gt;The past year has been a tumultuous one for Intel. Last summer, the company was forced to admit that it would be severely delaying its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu"&gt;upcoming 7nm architecture&lt;/a&gt; for its next generation of processors. That news was followed by the departure of the company’s hardware chief, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340993/intel-hardware-chief-venkata-murthy-renduchintala-leaving"&gt;Dr. Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228702/intel-ceo-bob-swan-pat-gelsinger-technical-financial"&gt;replacement of CEO Bob Swan&lt;/a&gt; with Pat Gelsinger (a former chief technology office and hardware engineer at the company) in an attempt to right the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUyXox"&gt;Gelsinger has wasted no time in trying to establish changes to get Intel back on track, announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;new “IDM 2.0” initiative&lt;/a&gt; in March that aims to see Intel return as an industry leader in chip manufacturing. As part of that plan, the company will be outsourcing production for “products at the core of Intel’s computing offerings” to competitors like TSMC and Samsung starting in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVjCCG"&gt;Intel is also working to launch a new branch of its business, Intel Foundry Services, which will see the company take on manufacturing projects for third-party companies, including a $20 billion investment in expanding its manufacturing facilities in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycv9uy"&gt;Given the overwhelming demand for more chip making companies in light of the global semiconductor shortage, Intel Foundry Services could be a big win for the company down the line. Intel announced today that it has over 100 potential customers interested in the service, and promised more news on Monday about the new initiative, but it’ll still be some time before that business ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola’s G100 midrange battery champ is now available in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_32l8T3w0dnMhLeTfkXSnc6SLY=/0x53:1250x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69619427/motog100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G100 offers respectable midrange specs like 5G and a Snapdragon 870 processor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWa3Uk"&gt;Motorola is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g100%2Fp%3FskuId%3D627&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F22%2F22589232%2Fmotorola-moto-g100-price-specs-screen-battery" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now selling the Moto G100 in the US&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;introducing it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for Latin American and European markets. It comes with midrange specs like a big 5,000mAh battery, 5G, and a 90Hz screen for a $599 MSRP. From now until August 5th, Motorola is offering a $100 discount off the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wLWt"&gt;There are two important footnotes on the G100’s US carrier compatibility: it’s a GSM-only phone, so will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile but not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is only compatible with T-Mobile’s 5G network. Outside of that, it appears to be a respectable midrange device, if priced a little on the high end. It uses a Snapdragon 870 processor with 8GB of RAM, sub-6GHz 5G, and a 6.7-inch 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Wz7"&gt;Motorola’s US phone releases this year have been concentrated around the $200-400 range, making G100 one of the pricier devices the company has introduced stateside recently. While a big battery, faster-refreshing screen, and a higher-tier processor feel fitting of its $599 price tag, its lack of IP-rating and broad carrier / 5G support could set it back against similarly priced peers like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (if you can still find one).&lt;/p&gt;
