    <title>After a wild week of stocks, you can’t stream most of the biggest Wall Street films</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="wolf of wall street" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5DzEn663R0o6_rCz7dJ-zEHlioQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745094/wolfofwallstreet7_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXkCY7"&gt;It has been a wild week for the stock market, with amateur traders from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt; battling traditional investors. The past several days have been full of massive swings in stocks like GameStop and AMC and app-fueled drama that’s sparked a larger debate over the nature of Wall Street as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VgOhhO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6CwwXn"&gt;But if you were hoping to kick back this weekend, relax, and enjoy a classic business movie about shark-like investors and over-confident Wall Street executives, you’re probably out of luck. Nearly every major finance film isn’t available to stream right now in the US (at least, not at the time of publication of this article), thanks to the capricious nature of the streaming marketplace, the increasingly fragmented libraries of studios, and the byzantine licensing deals that regulate what you can stream and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CJaPQ"&gt;This week’s short stock drama have you hankering for &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;? You won’t find it on Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Max. Right now, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; stream it with ads on Crackle, of all services. Paramount (which distributed the film) might be saving it for Paramount Plus, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;set to launch in March&lt;/a&gt;, but that won’t do you any good this weekend. Instead, your only option is to buy or rent it — which, it seems, many people are doing, given that the film has shot to &lt;a href="http://www.popvortex.com/movies/charts/top-movies.php"&gt;the No. 3 spot on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhNX3e"&gt;Maybe the ups and downs of the stock market reminded you more of Martin Scorsese’s &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, chronicling the rise and fall of investor Jordan Belfort. But the Paramount film is nowhere to be found on any streaming platform. So unless you’re willing to pony up some actual cash to buy or rent the film (which, like &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;, is shooting up rental charts), you won’t be enjoying Leonardo DiCaprio’s profanity-fueled chest-thumping either. The same applies to 2000’s &lt;em&gt;Boiler Room&lt;/em&gt;, which is also absent from any streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Big Short" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-iCebobzUbgBYILkhCIm1OYvhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4340571/bgs-01810r2.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bfOibo"&gt;20th Century Fox’s &lt;em&gt;Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; is — predictably — not on Disney Plus to stream, but it’s also not available on Hulu or any other service. If you are looking for a financial film to watch this weekend, though, the sequel, &lt;em&gt;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&lt;/em&gt;, is on Amazon Prime. There’s also &lt;em&gt;Margin Call&lt;/em&gt;, which is streaming on Peacock (for now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2E726"&gt;But the dearth of classic Wall Street films isn’t a unique issue. It’s one that streaming services have been grappling with in recent years, as big players like Netflix and Hulu have been less encompassing and streaming services have focused more on building up libraries of original content. There was a similar issue during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when millions of viewers looking to watch Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film &lt;em&gt;Contagion&lt;/em&gt; were frustrated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21164769/contagion-streaming-netflix-hulu-cinemax-itunes-download-torrent-coronavirus"&gt;the film wasn’t available to stream anywhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It9BWN"&gt;The fact that iconic Wall Street films will similarly miss the big moment around ambitious investors and skeevy short selling is indicative of a bigger problem with streaming in 2021, one that will likely continue to get worse as more and more studios continue to reclaim their content for their own services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Huo1yW"&gt;Then again, it’s almost fitting that the only way to watch &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Big Short &lt;/em&gt;this weekend is to pay a little extra cash back into the big financial machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaw78J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is using Status messages—its version of Stories— to try to reassure users about privacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9i6u0dKqiQO_O6JEQO2njq358o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744939/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WbyrdH"&gt;Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp has started posting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/3/15537000/whatsapp-stories-status-users-175-million"&gt;Status&lt;/a&gt; messages to users about its “commitment to your privacy.” The in-app messages were appearing for members of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff in the US and UK on Saturday, and some users reported the Status messages — WhatsApp’s version of Snapchat Stories or Twitter Fleets—have been appearing in India for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrCXp0"&gt;“There’s been a lot of misinformation and confusion around our recent update and we want to help everyone understand the facts behind how WhatsApp protects people’s privacy and security,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Going forward, we’re going to provide updates to people in the Status tab so people hear from WhatsApp directly. Our first update reaffirms that WhatsApp cannot see your personal messages, and neither can Facebook, because they are protected by end-to-end encryption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x89RYa"&gt;The messages read “One thing that isn’t new is our commitment to your privacy,” and a reminder that “WhatsApp can’t read or listen to your personal conversations as they’re end-to-end encrypted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwbtMdbIyUuxGhzSh-wsDKLJxKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22270076/whatsapp1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;WhatsApp adds Status updates about its privacy policy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdAAHjKaS4s7HGYPBt4iQTGQdtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22270078/whatsapp2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YPtva1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wqkVK"&gt;The messages are part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;larger effort from WhatsApp &lt;/a&gt;to dispel misperceptions about an upcoming update to its privacy policy. The update is meant to explain how businesses that use WhatsApp for customer service may store logs of their chats on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;previewed the changes&lt;/a&gt; to business chats in November. Given Facebook’s history of privacy blunders, however, users misinterpreted the changes to the privacy policy to mean WhatsApp would require sharing sensitive profile information with Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct7OXU"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy"&gt;posted an FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; about the changes, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;pushed back the date&lt;/a&gt; the update will take effect from February to May. It issued a statement earlier this month addressing the confusion to reiterate what the new privacy policy would cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="eKgK7g"&gt;The update does not change WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook and does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world. WhatsApp remains deeply committed to protecting people’s privacy. We are communicating directly with users through WhatsApp about these changes so they have time to review the new policy over the course of the next month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4KMWhH"&gt;Amid the ensuing confusion, rival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;messaging apps Signal&lt;/a&gt; and Telegram have both recently seen a surge in new users. Telegram said last week it’s added the ability for users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253918/telegram-ios-chat-history-import-whatsapp-line-kakaotalk"&gt;import their chat history from WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22244458/signal-new-features-animated-stickers-about-ios-android"&gt;Signal has added&lt;/a&gt; new mainstream chat features like animated stickers and wallpapers to its app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hokSsF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chromebooks just had their best year ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chromebook 14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVob3n7NLqhdsrzDUOeGtfxMWLI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744613/acerwm2_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gi0GK"&gt;According to analysts, Chromebooks had an incredible 2020, with the last quarter being the strongest ever for Google’s laptops (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/29/chromebook-covid-19-demand-market-growth/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to research firms Gartner and Canalys, over 30 million of the devices shipped last year, with somewhere between 11 and 11.7 million shipping in Q4 alone. Canalys says &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/tablets-chromebooks-q4-2020"&gt;that’s a staggering 287 percent&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; than were shipped in Q4 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh5wt8"&gt;The firms disagree on how much growth this is when compared to 2019, but both estimate that it’s a lot: Gartner estimates that Chromebooks are up 80 percent, while Canalys says it’s 109 percent. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;PC sales were up by 11 percent this year&lt;/a&gt;, which is the biggest growth the category had seen in a decade. This isn’t to give the impression that Chromebooks outsold PCs — Gartner estimates there were &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-11-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-10-point-7-percent-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2020-and-4-point-8-percent-for-the-year"&gt;275 million traditional computers sold this year&lt;/a&gt;, but it does show that one category is experiencing an explosion in growth, while another is recovering after a dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXgfSL"&gt;Education has a lot to do with it, according to Canalys. Chromebooks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362450/minecraft-education-edition-chromebook-version-now-available"&gt;are big sellers in the education market&lt;/a&gt;, and schools had to find a way to provide at-home students with computers for remote learning during COVID. Even the Vice President of Microsoft Education agrees that Chromebooks are great for schools — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-education-google-chromebooks-teams-2021-1?op=1&amp;amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;according to audio from a leaked meeting obtained by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he told his employees that “[i]n many cases, when schools are buying Chromebooks or Windows PCs, Chromebooks are still faster and cheaper, they are easier to deploy and manage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3o91qz"&gt;As students attend school from home, they’re obviously not going to be coming home to a different PC. A lot of kids I know have never used a traditional computer: they spend their time on Chromebooks and tablets instead. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Swift 5 (late 2020) puts the ‘ultra’ in ‘ultraportable’</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A lightweight laptop that doesn’t cut too many corners&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XJUMfP"&gt;If you need a laptop that’s not just light, but among the lightest of the light, you’re looking for the 14-inch Acer Swift 5. At just 2.31 pounds, it’s one of those devices that messes with your mind. When I pick it up, I feel like I must be holding a hollow chassis. When I put it in my backpack, I spend the day worrying that I might have left it at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwq1Hr"&gt;Sure, there are lighter laptops out there — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Asus’ Expertbook B9450&lt;/a&gt;, LG’s Gram 13, Acer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20750669/acer-swift-7-laptop-review-price-spec-features"&gt;Swift 7&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung’s Galaxy Book S, and Dynabook’s Portege X30L-G all weigh a bit less — but some of these models are either significantly more expensive than the Swift 5 or a step down in performance. If you’re looking for a real-deal processor for a mainstream consumer audience, the Swift 5 is about the lightest you can go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkoHaU"&gt;The model I tested, priced at $1,299.99, is a solid all-arounder without too much to criticize and not too much to gush about. Its standout feature is its weight and the performance-per-pound that it offers. Of course, for many students, remote workers, and frequent travelers, that could justifiably be a deciding factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QwMUM5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10310264"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of the Acer Swift 5, angled to the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8Zq09wogzPoXXOmhcUNxKtShU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266602/mchin_190423_4390_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer calls the color “a nourishing, plant-based hue.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oODc6g"&gt;Acer Swift 5 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MSIEGq"&gt;The first thing you may notice when looking at this Swift 5 is its unusual color. Our unit is a dark bluish-green hue called “mist green,” a new shade for the Swift line. Acer says it’s meant to convey a “restful, balanced lifestyle”; while I’m not sure I quite see that, I do appreciate that it’s slightly different from the infinite black and gray laptops you’ll see out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="aMDePl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10310225"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j53V3o"&gt;The unique finish also includes a new “silver-ion antimicrobial agent,” which Acer says will help to kill lingering bacteria. I’m not sure how many people are catching diseases from their laptops to begin with, but I suppose it can’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRL2ER"&gt;The screen bezels have shrunk from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21112598/acer-swift-5-laptop-review-price-spec-features-weight-design"&gt;last year’s Swift 5&lt;/a&gt; design, giving the display a more modern appearance. In particular, a large bottom bezel that used to hold a flashy Acer logo is gone. (That logo is now at the top of the keyboard deck.) Last year’s model had an 86.4 percent screen-to-body ratio, while this year’s clocks in at 90 percent. The screen is also brighter than its predecessor’s (321 nits as tested, to last year’s 300 nits) with great colors and contrast, though its 16:9 aspect ratio is a bit cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saoVwM"&gt;The Swift also provides good connectivity for such a thin device (it’s just 0.59 inches thick). You get one USB 3.2 Gen 2 (supporting Thunderbolt 4, DisplayPort, and charging), two USB 3.2 Gen 1, one HDMI 2.0, one combination audio jack, and Acer’s AC port. It would be nice to have an SD slot or a second USB-C, but that’s a passing grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mpyT5"&gt;Elsewhere, the Swift 5 provides a smooth and accurate touchpad as well as a solid keyboard with comfortable keys. I hit my standard typing speeds and didn’t make a single error on my usual typing test, which has never happened to me before. For authentication, there’s a reliable and fast fingerprint reader below the arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NT5y5x"&gt;The only real downside of the Swift’s thin and light build is that it feels a tad flimsy. There is a bit of flex in the screen and some very noticeable flex in the keyboard. I wouldn’t say it all feels &lt;em&gt;cheap &lt;/em&gt;— the build is clearly a step up from budget fare like the Swift 3 — but it will feel and look plasticky next to more expensive ultraportables like the Dell XPS 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 5 seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UplK5ivOEOkTsx8L88gtxQbutuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266607/mchin_190423_4390_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer says the webcam supports super high dynamic range imaging (SHDR).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 5 ports on the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/quMY0dGcyFU_GIhVRzFepvt1Sxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266603/mchin_190423_4390_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thunderbolt 4 ports are still compatible with previous Thunderbolt products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 5 keyboard from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyyT2tKh86IrqArX-4iRGKfy03c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266604/mchin_190423_4390_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is backlit, too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TgDDML"&gt;Acer Swift 5 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W7PCe4"&gt;The biggest news about this new Swift 5 is its brand-new Tiger Lake processor, the quad-core Core i7-1165G7. With this chip come a number of new features, including Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 6, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Yb1Lf"&gt;The Swift is also certified through Evo, Intel’s verification program for Tiger Lake systems. To earn an Evo badge, a laptop has to provide a variety of benefits like one-second wake time, nine hours of battery life with real-world use, and reliable performance. Not every Evo-certified system I’ve tested has hit those marks in my testing, but the Swift 5 certainly came close.       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZ55vu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re not compromising horsepower for this form factor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jm8QXm"&gt;In addition to the processor, the $1,299.99 system includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. There’s also a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-5-laptop-sf514-55ta-56ch%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.A6SAA.002&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22256779%2Facer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999.99 base model&lt;/a&gt; available, including a Core i5-1135G7 (also with Xe graphics), 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. Either of these models is a fine purchase, but folks who don’t need their Swift to do anything graphically intensive should probably be just fine with the $999 configuration. Reviews have shown that the Core i5-1135G7 &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/That-awkward-moment-when-a-Core-i5-1135G7-can-outperform-the-more-expensive-Core-i7-1165G7.512848.0.html"&gt;often matches and sometimes outperforms&lt;/a&gt; the Core i7-1165G7 in CPU-intensive tasks. Some other excellent laptops with similar portability benefits also fall between the $999 and the $1,299 price points, making the $1,299 model a somewhat harder sell. Asus’ 2.49-pound, 0.54-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt; with equivalent specs is just $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrvntS"&gt;You’re not compromising horsepower for this form factor. The Swift 5 is the fastest Tiger Lake laptop I’ve reviewed so far (apart from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release"&gt;a very high-clocked reference design&lt;/a&gt;), though it’s not quite on the level of some recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21423498/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-2020-amd-review"&gt;AMD Ryzen products&lt;/a&gt;. I certainly never noticed any slowdowns or errors in my day-to-day work. And while this isn’t a laptop you’d buy for gaming, Iris Xe graphics are good enough to run some lighter fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38gxpz"&gt;The bottom of the chassis got warm during an intense day of Chrome multitasking, downloading and updating, photo editing, Zoom calls, Spotify streaming, and Netflix watching, but it was never uncomfortable to touch. I often heard the fans while the Swift was in Performance Mode, as well as a very occasional coil whine, but swapping to Silent Mode eliminated both of those. (You can easily toggle between cooling profiles with Fn+F.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 5 lid, closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-i-VTStPikILLCPrbnhbWHSuY3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266601/mchin_190423_4390_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The viewing angle is up to 179 degrees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fWpqX4"&gt;And battery life was a pleasant surprise. I averaged eight hours and five minutes of continuous multitasking (around 200 nits of brightness) on this version — a big step up from the six hours I got out of last year’s Swift 5. Battery life also improved significantly after I got rid of some programs that came loaded onto this machine, including ExpressVPN, Amazon (which is pinned to the taskbar), and Norton. It only takes a few minutes to dump all of these programs, but considering that this laptop costs over $1,000, it’s still frustrating that Acer is loading it with budget crapware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsIYI0"&gt;The final thing I’ll discuss is videoconferencing software since that’s important functionality for many mobile professionals. The results here are mixed. The good news is that the Swift 5 now supports AI-enhanced background noise suppression and Wi-Fi 6. Those are difficult to test, but I did do a number of Zoom calls on the Swift 5, and nobody had trouble hearing me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2HfKQ"&gt;In less-good news, the 720p webcam is fairly grainy. (It’s not good enough to support Windows Hello.) The dual stereo speakers also deliver some of the weakest audio I’ve heard from a laptop — bass in music was quite thin. The Swift does come loaded with DTS Audio Processing, which allows you to swap between preset profiles for music, movies, and games, and to tweak equalizer settings yourself. There’s no profile specific to videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 5 open, seen from the front. The screen depicts a green, blue, and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lQ6RT6NzgKsZJ9CnWQ_aXWVjOlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266605/mchin_190423_4390_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Swift 5 includes dual copper heat pipes, and a fold-under hinge provides extra airflow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oGbQiE"&gt;Inside its thin and light exterior, the 2021 Acer Swift 5 is a midrange laptop through and through. There are compromises but no disasters. Most aspects of it (the keyboard, the touchpad, the screen, the connectivity, the battery life) are just fine. Others (the webcam, the audio, the bloatware) are underwhelming but serviceable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EsZd35"&gt;If these factors are what you care most about, you can get similar quality for less money in Acer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21815008/acer-aspire-5-review-2020-15-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Aspire 5&lt;/a&gt;, Asus’ ZenBook 14, HP’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Envy x360&lt;/a&gt; 13, and plenty of more affordable machines. If you’re paying a premium for this Swift 5 configuration, you’re paying for the exceptionally lightweight build. The portable chassis — and the power Acer has packed into that portable chassis — is where the Swift 5 is at the top of its class.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subscribers of Apple TV Plus will continue to get credit refunds until June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tqsWxjsHFChML6wk9CwJdtIgMlY=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744478/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJvIq"&gt;Apple has notified subscribers of its Apple TV Plus streaming service that they’ll continue to get refund credits on their accounts until June, following a second extension of its free trial program earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/30/apple-tv-subscribers-will-continue-receiving-credit-refunds-until-june"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl2Iwp"&gt;Apple extended the free year-long trials of Apple TV Plus to customers until July 2021. The trials were included with the purchase of any Apple device (an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;; an earlier extension had pushed back the free trial end date to February, allowing users who started a free trial between November 2019 and June 2020 to get up to five months of additional access for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XACfxV"&gt;But before Apple issued the first extension of the free trial, some users had switched to paid subscription status in the meantime, and Apple gave these customers refund credits. It’s doing the same thing for the second extension. &lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; says affected subscribers are being advised via email that they’ll receive monthly credits of $4.99 (or the local equivalent) to their Apple accounts, which will be automatically applied for each month the subscriber is charged between February and June. The credits can be used toward App Store purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A good COVID-19 vaccine is good enough </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eastern Colorado VA Receives Shipments Of Covid-19 Vaccines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gx1IRkC0DwmKrbqVk_8wUgewcqQ=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744474/1230141900.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OS3R3M"&gt;Experts have been looking forward to seeing results from Johnson and Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine trials for months. The vaccine is a logistical dream compared to the other two authorized in the US. It’s much easier to store, and it requires only one shot instead of the two required by its competitors. The only outstanding question was how well it actually worked. On Friday, they got their answer — it works pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="aATmbJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg4vpd"&gt;In a 43,783 person trial that spanned the globe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;the vaccine was 66 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. Now, 66 percent might seem like a let down compared to the 90-plus percent efficacy from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556286/coronavirus-vaccine-effective-pfizer-fda-safety"&gt;Pfizer/BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s a matter of perspective. Before results of those vaccine trials came out, researchers were &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; for efficacies of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/"&gt;between 60 and 70 percent&lt;/a&gt;.  (By comparison, seasonal flu vaccines are given the thumbs up &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm"&gt;when they’re 40-60 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJI5YE"&gt;All that’s to say, the new vaccine candidate is still very good at what it does, as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine/617880/"&gt;many people&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/01/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-could-be-game-changing.html"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because 66 percent effectiveness is better than zero, which is where a lot of us are operating right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7AoWBU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A single-shot J&amp;amp;J Janssen COVID19 vaccine phase 3 results summarized in one table. Great news! Imagine being   protected from death 28 days after a single shot, and   protected from severe disease after 49 days - against all variants. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gGCcDbMglr"&gt;https://t.co/gGCcDbMglr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gPCDgG8oNJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gPCDgG8oNJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Prof. Akiko Iwasaki (@VirusesImmunity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VirusesImmunity/status/1355149007220310019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4ymH7"&gt;Not only that, but the vaccine was 85 percent effective at preventing the most severe forms of the disease. That’s pretty fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5NCKV"&gt;Here’s the not-so-fantastic thing. The reason that the vaccine was ‘only’ 66 percent effective in the trial is that it didn’t do as well in South Africa, where a worrying new variant is circulating widely. While the efficacy in the US was 72 percent, the efficacy in South Africa was 57 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP7EHJ"&gt;That’s still &lt;em&gt;not bad&lt;/em&gt;. But it does mean that there’s a clock ticking in the background as the company moves to get the vaccine candidate authorized. The variants are spreading quickly — one was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/28/south-africa-variant-south-carolina/"&gt;first detected in the US this week&lt;/a&gt;. The sooner the world can be vaccinated, the better the chance all these vaccines will be at stopping the spread of the virus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGS1tc"&gt;“We’ve got to get the first dose to as many people as possible,” virologist Akiko Iwasaki told &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;. “These variants that are more transmissible and potentially even more lethal are on the rise. I think time is really what we’re fighting against.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BSYtW"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J99UGP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="SKSx7w"&gt;How should you behave after you get a vaccine? Caution and preventative measures are still warranted, but Julia Marcus makes the case for letting vaccinated people get a little bit closer to normal. (Julia Marcus/&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="tEjvrh"&gt;Vaccination campaigns take a lot of resources, and in some cases, they’re resources that health departments just don’t have. Some are being forced to choose between testing and vaccination — and they’re understandably choosing vaccines.  (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has another story about how some areas are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248339/covid-vaccine-certification-pharmacist-class"&gt;requiring potential vaccinators&lt;/a&gt; to go through long training programs that cost hundreds of dollars.

    <title>Escape from GameStop stock drama with these deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ha59yxERNpinxXZtlreXYznFfAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744270/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Keyboard for 11-inch iPad Pros and the new iPad Air is $100 off. Scroll down to find the deal&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvrKbG"&gt;January 2021 has been full of important news, but it’s been a bit lousy when it comes to deals. Still, we’ve done our part in scouring all of the major retailers for discounts on products we care about (and we think you care about, too). There aren’t many brand-new deals to be found in this week’s dispatch, but go ahead and take a look if you haven’t been following them closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfvWLq"&gt;If you feel caught up on deals, here’s a reminder that you can hang out here to have a quiet moment from all of the ongoing GameStop and AMC stock drama. Then again, if this is the first time you’re hearing about all of that and want to hear more, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2p85ltIvg"&gt;my colleague Liz Lopatto’s Big Picture video that’s all about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lN8iJo"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ed5sPt"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are $278, and well worth it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="za4upJ"&gt;Once in a blue moon, Sony’s latest flagship wireless headphones with active noise cancellation and excellent sound see a deep discount. That’s happening now, actually, and you can save $72 on the WH-1000XM4 — headphones I’d spring for immediately if I wasn’t still well-served by their predecessor. This model is considerably better, though, with support for simultaneous Bluetooth connections, and it has an automatic pause function when you remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCRNSh"&gt;I’ve listed a few links below, but this deal is also happening at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html%3F"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get the headphones with a 20,800mAh power bank for no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BA4ETR"&gt;Razer’s cheaper Opus headphones are $60 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9h8suT"&gt;For something far less expensive (and really, not all that different), Razer’s Opus wireless, noise-canceling headphones are $140 at Amazon. They’re normally $200. For this price, it’s a good deal considering these over-ear cans can automatically play and pause music when you put them on, and they have active noise cancellation and USB-C charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ArCKF6"&gt;Get a simple smart clock with four smart bulbs for just $30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3QlNDw"&gt;Best Buy is hosting a fantastic deal on a smart home starter kit of sorts. Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/8/21553993/lenovo-smart-clock-essential-smart-alarm-clock-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review by Dan Seifert here&lt;/a&gt;) is usually $50 on its own, but it’s in this kit alongside a four-pack of C by GE white 60W LED bulbs that you can control with your voice via Google Assistant, which is what the Smart Clock Essential has built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pZ9Bc7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10293534"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jjIp61"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard is still $100 off at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dZDdy6"&gt;Walmart’s exclusive deal on the Apple Magic Keyboard has lasted far longer than I expected it to. Normally $299, it’s $199 now. It’ll work with the 11-inch iPad Pro or the latest iPad Air (also released in 2020, with USB-C charging). When you pop it on, it will grant your tablet its very own dedicated keyboard and trackpad. It essentially provides a laptop-like experience, in case you’re trying to get more done and don’t want to lug around too many devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p87pK4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>After aborted SLS hot-fire test, NASA and Boeing will try, try again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hot Fire Test of SLS Rocket Core Stage" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WsoPp-puci2qBaLskz8gibZb3SE=/0x0:5382x3588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68743176/1230627236.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by NASA/Robert Markowitz via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9EUARI"&gt;NASA will make another attempt next month to test-fire its massive Space Launch System rocket after its first try was cut short, the agency said Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Sq6Mk"&gt;The rocket’s 212-foot-tall core stage will try to fire its four engines for eight minutes at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The attempt is the last milestone “Green Run” test before the behemoth rocket gets shipped to Florida for its debut launch toward the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP0d7p"&gt;All four of the rocket’s Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25 engines ignited together for the first time earlier this month. But what was intended to be an eight minute test only lasted a little over a minute — a much shorter runtime than what engineers needed to proceed to Florida. The SLS core has been in development for a decade, and has consistently been late and over budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a3bdRB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is still possible to launch Artemis I this year with this test in February”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbyNek"&gt;“Conducting a second hot fire test will allow the team to repeat operations from the first hot fire test and obtain data on how the core stage and the engines perform over a longer period that simulates more activities during the rocket’s launch and ascent,” NASA said in a blog post late Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QlN3a"&gt;NASA is targeting November for the SLS’s first launch, but the agency’s inspector general and the Government Accountability Office, the country’s biggest watchdog agency, say that’s unlikely. Instead, they indicated the launch will likely to slip into 2022. NASA remains publicly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsF6pg"&gt;“It is still possible to launch Artemis I this year with this test in February,” NASA spokeswoman Kathryn Hambleton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea9kK3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6fkJy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GeForce Now comes to Chrome browsers and M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OAr18lXh1kXHyh1lYmNUkIlyZFo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68743172/GeForce_NOW_Platforms_crop_verge.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j2PY2a"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now game streaming service has launched for the Chrome web browser and M1 Macs in beta (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/play-nvidia-geforce-now-games-chrome-windows-macos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), bringing resource intensive games to laptops and other devices that might not have been powerful to run them on their own. We just tested out &lt;a href="https://play.geforcenow.com/"&gt;the Chrome browser version&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac and a Windows 10 PC, and it seems to be running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcKoiP"&gt;GeForce Now already had applications for Windows 10 and Android devices, but expanded to an even wider audience with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;beta launch for Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2020, and followed it up by beating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;Stadia to iOS devices&lt;/a&gt; with a web app workaround that lets you stream games through the Safari web browser there. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tca61P7zbFbquI9qjszo5qot5BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22269250/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_4.04.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeForce Now running in Chrome on MacOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GAykBu"&gt;Now, theoretically anyone with a Chrome browser can start streaming by heading &lt;a href="https://play.geforcenow.com/"&gt;GeForce Now’s site&lt;/a&gt; and creating an account, even on a weak laptop. Or, if you’re on a new M1 Mac, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fpt-br%2Fgeforce%2Frelease-notes%2FGFN%2F2_0_27%2FRich%2Fgfn-v2_0_27-rich-release-highlights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F29%2F22257077%2Fnvidia-geforce-now-launch-chrome-m1-macs#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for this new version of GeForce Now, through a new dedicated application. Nvidia’s changelog also lists a few other changes to make the service more useful in a browser, like the ability to create dedicated shortcuts for your games and a new way to share links that can send your friend directly to a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VayPUO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21454917/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-comparison-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-game-pass-geforce-now"&gt;Like Google Stadia and Amazon Luna&lt;/a&gt;, GeForce Now is essentially a PC in the cloud that you “rent” to stream your games. You can play with a mouse and keyboard, a gamepad, even a wireless headset — all of them worked for us seamlessly in Chrome. It is worth noting Microsoft Edge isn’t currently supported, even though it’s a Chromium browser now. Of course, you’ll need to be in a region where GeForce Now is available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dyWKorSMbLVFoMyJInQLgQxPYSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22269298/edge_geforce_now_supported_not_yet.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you’ll see if you try to launch in Microsoft Edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rud6Bh"&gt;GeForce Now’s expansion hasn’t been all sunshine and roses. The service has Steam integration, so you can unlock PC games you might already own to stream via the service, but not all games work because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272558/nvidia-geforce-now-opt-in-agreement-game-developers-publishers-licensing-cloud-gaming"&gt;developers have to opt-in&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing"&gt;weren’t too happy with Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; because GeForce Now let players stream their games without permission (and let Nvidia profit off a monthly membership). And though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;its rival Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt; has a smaller library of even more tightly curated games, it can often offer a clearer picture and higher resolution than Nvidia does right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnrufM"&gt;The full list of devices GeForce Now supports &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fdownload%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F29%2F22257077%2Fnvidia-geforce-now-launch-chrome-m1-macs#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is available here&lt;/a&gt;. GeForce Now will also come &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224359/google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now-lg-tv-2021"&gt;come to LG TVs in 2021.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QtnEAovBzzNo2IdDd2EoyY-hmDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22269306/nvidia_geforce_now_chrome.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite Chrome, Nvidia is still recommending the native app “for the best experience”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s SpaceX violated its launch license in explosive Starship test, triggering an FAA probe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX CEO Elon Musk Gives Update On Starship Launch Vehicle At Texas Launch Facility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zcokmmy3Ta0SgFV2mAWNBWN3h4=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742730/1171862745.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Loren Elliott / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ccdBcK"&gt;SpaceX’s first high-altitude test flight of its Starship rocket, which launched successfully but exploded in a botched landing attempt in December, violated the terms of its Federal Aviation Administration test license, according to two people familiar with the incident. Both the landing explosion and license violation prompted a formal investigation by the FAA, driving regulators to put extra scrutiny on Elon Musk’s hasty Mars rocket test campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXy3VW"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"&gt;December test launch&lt;/a&gt; of the “Serial Number 8” Starship prototype at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas, facilities was hailed by Musk as a success: “Mars, here we come!!” the chief executive tweeted moments after the rocket exploded on its landing, celebrating SN8’s successful 8-mile-high ascent with his followers. The FAA, which oversees ground safety and issues licenses for private launches, was not so happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wkzv9Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA, which oversees ground safety and issues licenses for private launches, was not so happy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImK2hT"&gt;The so-called mishap investigation was opened that week, focusing not only on the explosive landing but on SpaceX’s refusal to stick to the terms of what the FAA authorized, the two people said. It was unclear what part of the test flight violated the FAA license, and an FAA spokesman declined to specify in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpEUof"&gt;“The FAA will continue to work with SpaceX to evaluate additional information provided by the company as part of its application to modify its launch license,” FAA spokesman Steve Kulm said Friday. “While we recognize the importance of moving quickly to foster growth and innovation in commercial space, the FAA will not compromise its responsibility to protect public safety. We will approve the modification only after we are satisfied that SpaceX has taken the necessary steps to comply with regulatory requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj118R"&gt;The heightened scrutiny from regulators after the launchpad spectacle has played a role in holding up SpaceX’s latest “SN9” Starship test attempt, which the company said would happen on Thursday. The shiny steel alloy, 16-story-tall rocket was loaded with fuel and ready to fly. But at the time, FAA officials were still going through their license review process for the test because of several changes SpaceX made in its license application, a source said. Musk, frustrated with the process, took to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UuTqPZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FUFOBX"&gt;“Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure,” he tweeted on Thursday. “Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqhrC7"&gt;The license violation (and subsequent license review process) has escalated tensions between SpaceX and the world’s biggest transportation agency. For years, Musk and others in the space industry have bemoaned the age-old US regulatory framework for launch licensing as innovation and competition in space skyrockets. In response, the US Department of Transportation — which delegates its launch oversight duties to the FAA — unveiled new streamlined launch licensing regulations last year. They have yet to go into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="majcY1"&gt;In the meantime, Musk’s tweet, calling out the FAA to his 44 million followers, was the latest embodiment of the billionaire’s disgruntled attitude toward regulators that deal with his businesses’ rapid rate of development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4hE52"&gt;SpaceX, founded by Musk in 2002, has sued the Air Force twice, once successfully in 2014 for the right to compete for Pentagon launches, and another unsuccessfully in 2018 for losing out on competitive development funds for Starship and the company’s other rockets. In 2018, when he was fined $20 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly misleading Tesla investors via Twitter, Musk told &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes,&lt;/em&gt; “I do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYB2mf"&gt;A few hours before the SN8 Starship test in December, while Musk was in Boca Chica securing approval for the FAA license that SpaceX ultimately violated, he was asked in a virtual interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;what role government should play in regulating innovation. Musk replied: “A lot of the time, the best thing the government can do is just get out of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
