    <title>London’s electric scooter trials will kick off on June 7th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btxLkZ"&gt;London’s long-awaited electric scooter trials will begin next month on June 7th, the city’s transport authority and local councils announced today. Three scooter companies have been selected to offer rentals for up to 12 months as part of the pilot program: Dott, Lime, and Tier. Privately owned electric scooters will continue to be illegal to ride on streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCUUE8"&gt;The selected companies will initially offer scooters to rent across six boroughs and local authorities in London: Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Richmond upon Thames, the City of London, and Canary Wharf. While rentals will not be available in Tower Hamlets, Londoners will be able to ride their rented scooters through the borough. Lambeth and Southwark boroughs are also seeking to participate in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI4iWg"&gt;This might sound like a long list of areas, but it’s just a fraction of the 32 boroughs that make up the UK’s capital. London’s transport authority Transport for London (TfL) says more areas are expected to join the trial as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A3h8iK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The trials will only cover a small portion of the city&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KZuVWD"&gt;While rented electric scooters have become a common sight across many cities around the world, the UK has been much slower to embrace the new form of transport. Until recently, electric scooters were completely illegal to ride on British streets. It was only in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307974/uk-electric-scooter-rentals-legal-public-roads-micro-mobility"&gt;July last year&lt;/a&gt; that the situation started to change, with the government allowing trials of electric scooter rentals. But outside of the pilot programs, privately owned electric scooters are still illegal to ride on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP1OU7"&gt;TfL’s announcement specifically cites the pandemic as a key reason for the importance of the new method of transport. Rather than having people flock to cars as a way of avoiding crowded buses and trains, authorities want electric scooters to offer an environmentally friendly and socially distanced way of getting around. “We’re doing all we can to support London’s safe and sustainable recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and it’s clear that e-scooters could act as an innovative, greener alternative to car trips,” said TfL’s electric scooter trial lead Helen Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcy2cc"&gt;Each electric scooter rental company will have to comply with a host of safety requirements to offer rentals in the city. Speeds will be capped at 12.5 miles per hour (reducing to eight miles per hour in specified “go-slow” areas), and scooters will be required to have always-on front and rear lights. They’re also required to have “audible warning systems” that riders can operate without taking their hands off the handlebars. The scooters will also be equipped with geofencing to ensure that they’re correctly parked in designated locations, and operators will have to collect them if they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCQny8"&gt;Scooters can be ridden on roads and cycle paths but not on sidewalks. When the government announced the start of the trials last year, it said riders would have to be over the age of 16 and have at least a provisional car, motorcycle, or moped license to ride. We’ve reached out to TfL to clarify whether these requirements will apply to the London trials. Riders will also need to take an “e-learning safety course” before hiring their first scooter in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vctCy5"&gt;London will be far from the first city in the UK to have launched its electric scooter trials. &lt;a href="https://mindthezag.com/places/where-are-the-uks-e-scooter-trials/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zag &lt;/em&gt;has compiled a list&lt;/a&gt; of over 50 trials that have been launched across the country over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hswD65"&gt;&lt;q&gt;London is the latest UK city to announce a trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTI0FN"&gt;Despite technically being illegal to use on public streets, privately owned electric scooters have become an increasingly common sight in London. National retailers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fscooters%2Felectric-scooters%2F%3Fcm_mmc%3DGoogle-_-KZ%2520-%2520Kids%2520Scooters%2520-%2520Own%2520Brand-_-Electric%2520Scooters%2520Exact-_-ad%26source%3Dppc%26_%2524ja%3Dtsid%3A35522%257Ccid%3A9696423349%257Cagid%3A96673753582%257Ctid%3Akwd-440281686218%257Ccrid%3A427046351899%257Cnw%3Ag%257Crnd%3A17179386706488057195%257Cdvc%3Ac%257Cadp%3A%257Cmt%3Ae%257Cloc%3A9045992%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwqIiFBhAHEiwANg9szmYVfaHPyq6JDYzbIUbfUev_aoZ_RTpvdFwpCEK-YIlA16vnObSx8xoC27gQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F17%2F22440320%2Flondon-electric-scooter-rental-trial-dott-lime-tier" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like Halfords&lt;/a&gt; sell a range of models, although Halfords’ website carries a warning that they’re only legal on private property with the owner’s permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBp41A"&gt;The three scooter operators chosen for London’s trials already offer rentals in other cities around the world. Dott offers rentals across 16 cities in Europe, while Tier serves 100 cities across 12 countries. As well as offering electric scooter rentals in other cities, Lime has previously offered electric bike rentals in London. Notably absent from the list is Bird, which has offered electric scooter rentals on private property in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18067670/bird-electric-scooters-uk-london-pilot-launch-european-expansion"&gt;London’s Olympic Park&lt;/a&gt;. London has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335611/paris-electric-scooter-competition-lime-tier-dott-bird"&gt;joined Paris&lt;/a&gt; in deciding against allowing the company to operate on its streets, even after it announced a massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332624/bird-europe-investment-scooter-expansion-new-hires"&gt;$150 million European expansion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Cx9GC"&gt;As well as setting their own pricing, individual scooter operators are offering some unique features. Tier, for example, is installing charging pods in local businesses across the city and will give users free rides if they exchange their scooters’ drained battery for a fully charged one at a charging station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u60Xn6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNMDvU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fox is making a blockchain animated series with Rick and Morty creator Dan Harmon to sell you NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kh_SQ-qyc-RKJBiWLwPRYOobqgQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301717/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsTsrk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox.com/krapopolis/"&gt;Fox has announced&lt;/a&gt; its upcoming animated comedy &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis, &lt;/em&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; creator Dan Harmon, will be “the first-ever animated series curated entirely on the Blockchain.” The company plans to try to generate buzz for the show with its own brand-new NFT company dubbed Blockchain Creative Labs, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/dan-harmon-blockchain-nft-crypto-series-fox-1234954403/"&gt;THR reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdCdpm"&gt;Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier told advertisers during its upfronts presentation on Monday that “as an advertiser-focused, artist-first and animation-obsessed company, Fox is going to take advertisers into the world of Blockchain-powered tokens, including NFTs.” It will launch a dedicated marketplace for &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis&lt;/em&gt;, a show set in mythical ancient Greece “centered on a flawed family of humans, gods, and monsters that tries to run one of the world’s first cities without killing each other.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="EoCpCN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VfrI0E"&gt;The marketplace will “curate and sell digital goods ranging from NFTs of one-of-a-kind character and background art and GIFs, as well as tokens that provide exclusive social experiences to engage and reward super fans,” according to Fox. Characters and artwork from the show will become NFT collectibles — because why let the internet GIF your show for free when you can sell them GIFs as NFTs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zflZ6Q"&gt;NFTs of some well-known memes have proven lucrative for their creators, including &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bad-luck-brian-meme-nft-crypto-art-blockchain-ethereum-foundation-2021-3"&gt;Bad Luck Brian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/grumpycat/grumpy-cat-5467"&gt;Grumpy Cat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/keyboardcat/play-him-off-keyboard-cat-5553"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt;. The image of Disaster Girl, whose real name is Zoe Roth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;went for $500,000&lt;/a&gt;, and Nyan Cat’s creator Chris Torres sold &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html"&gt;that meme for nearly $600,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iw8vd"&gt;A whole show that will produce NFT-ready content is a new twist on the idea, however, and counts on &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis&lt;/em&gt; becoming popular enough to attract bidders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zlbAdi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mTF4cX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is teasing a big Wear OS update for smartwatches tomorrow at I/O</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fossil Gen 5 with LTE smartwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqyZHnqBfYotUc-pRzfO6BgRGn4=/0x2:7952x5303/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301515/FSL3748731_SP21_AD_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ohIG8n"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WearOSbyGoogle/status/1394357382747144194?s=20"&gt;new tweet&lt;/a&gt; from the official Wear OS Twitter account is teasing an update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;tomorrow at I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; to Google’s frequently forgotten smartwatch operating system. Google has even suggested that the developer conference will feature an entirely new version of Wear OS on the I/O Adventure page, the “virtual sandbox” for trying the products Google will announce at the conference, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/17/brand-new-wear-version-google-i-o/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zldiUh"&gt;Wear OS has been on a long and bumpy journey up until this point — with new features, but not the dramatic rethinking of the platform that it may need. In the last year, Google has added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423707/google-wear-os-gboard-swipe-type"&gt;a new keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22328909/google-third-party-developers-tiles-wear-os"&gt;third-party Tiles&lt;/a&gt; (Wear OS’s answer to glanceable widget-like information), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366514/google-wear-os-fall-update-smartwatch-faster-apps-weather-pairing"&gt;improvements to performance&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17912358/wear-os-2-1-smartwatches-software-update"&gt;last major design change&lt;/a&gt; to Wear OS — other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525335/google-wear-os-tiles-widgets-new-feature-announced"&gt;the addition of Tiles&lt;/a&gt; — came in 2018. If anything, Google’s tease is a welcome sign of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ktzQgu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The time has come for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join us tomorrow for a look at what’s new on Wear OS. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ylGiIevTc4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ylGiIevTc4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Wear OS by Google (@WearOSbyGoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WearOSbyGoogle/status/1394357382747144194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u3S2S8"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18187026/google-fossil-group-smartwatch-sale-40-million-wear-os-android"&gt;Google’s acquisition of Fossil’s smartwatch tech&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943993/google-fitbit-acquisition-smartwatch-wearable-fitness-nest-htc-hardware-software"&gt;its plans to acquire Fitbit&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, reignited the hope that it would also acquire a renewed interest in wearables as a concept. The process of absorbing Fitbit in particular was drawn out for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347798/eu-google-fitbit-acquisition-investigation-rumors"&gt;health data privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; that came with it, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22188428/google-fitbit-acquisition-completed-approved"&gt;the deal was ultimately approved in 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNJT7x"&gt;In the meantime, Google’s other wearable partners kept the platform on life support. Fossil’s watches — like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the 2019 Gen 5&lt;/a&gt; and 2021 Gen 5 LTE — were frequently limited by the subpar performance of Qualcomm’s smartwatch processors. Mobvoi took a different approach with its 2021 TicWatch Pro 3, by skinning Wear OS, layering in an extra display, and filling the watch with a suite of custom apps, but still ran into some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22314135/ticwatch-pro-3-fossil-gen-5-lte-review-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;inherently Wear OS-type issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tEk3o"&gt;But back to the hope on the horizon: Google is teasing a new Wear OS version, and there are rumors of some hardware to back that up — Samsung is reportedly dropping its Tizen OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439989/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-tizen-switch"&gt;in exchange for using Google’s software&lt;/a&gt; on its next smartwatches. With a big powerful new partner, a wearable team of its own, and the possibility of Android 12’s rumored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/16/22438065/new-leaks-ahead-google-io-android-12-big-changes"&gt;new visual design&lt;/a&gt; coming to Wear OS, it suddenly seems like Google might have a plan for your wrist. We’ll have to watch this week to see how promising that plan actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hugo Barra is leaving Facebook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg Addresses F8 Facebook Developer Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O0NfCB29zgujgdz27DD2UCEOJ1c=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301316/953502230.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkN4JM"&gt;Facebook’s vice president of AR and VR Hugo Barra is leaving the company, he announced (where else) &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hbarra76/posts/10157618478316612"&gt;on Facebook Monday&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfMh6v"&gt;“Today is my last day at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookrealitylabs/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZX2UjmeNgpyMfjeRfjrmWG0FmYcWpqLoUAq4Q_UN1yNAKjw8-Wxj8BHgwCPA2Zupfzuawfl6sVU_ISkvkxBPTJbg5aH79f5Cfo1YzZueKATci6RIi5fpMt79ybbqiVTIHIKja3PD7xMNdRtEpdJjnfD&amp;amp;__tn__=kK-R"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, after 4 years working on projects that have been more exciting and more challenging than anything I’ve encountered in my career, with some of the brightest minds and kindest people I’ve ever had the pleasure to meet,” Barra wrote in the post. He said he planned to “explore the healthcare technology space,” so he could apply what he had learned in consumer tech to solve problems in health care. “I believe society is still poorly equipped with the tools people need to really understand our health and gain control over our health outcomes,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WVBs4"&gt;After serving as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/28/4669960/android-vp-hugo-barra-reportedly-leaving-google-for-chinese"&gt;Google’s vice president of Android product management and then several years at Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt;, Barra joined Facebook in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18563171/facebook-oculus-ar-vr-head-hugo-barra-stepping-down-new-role-jason-rubin-eric-tseng"&gt;2017 to run its Oculus VR team&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, he moved to his current role, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1126534172816728064"&gt;tasked with&lt;/a&gt; “building a global AR/VR partner ecosystem” based in New York City, which eventually became part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18141524/facebook-building-8-reality-labs-ar-vr-portal-skunkworks-hardware-division"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv10mK"&gt;Barra is leaving Facebook before the company launches its first pair of consumer “smart glasses,” which it said last year would be a branded Ray-Ban product. He touted the project on Twitter last September and mentioned the launch in his farewell note (but didn’t provide details about a release date other than “this year”). &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306279147778568194?s=20"&gt;Barra said development of the smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; became “his main focus at Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nv3EYa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beyond thrilled to finally share a sneak peek of our Facebook partnership with Ray-Ban! Our first smart glasses will launch next year, and that’s just the beginning… The future will be a classic and it's coming in 2021   &lt;a href="https://t.co/l9992ZQGoy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/l9992ZQGoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hugo Barra (@hbarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306278791669579776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="syhSIk"&gt;But after announcing in September that the smart glasses were coming sometime in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/facebook-lowers-expectations-for-its-upcoming-ray-ban-smart-glasses.html"&gt;Facebook tried to temper expectations&lt;/a&gt; about the smart glasses; in March, CFO David Wehner said at a conference that the glasses wouldn’t be close to the technology Facebook eventually hopes to achieve in AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qkI1n"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg thanked Barra for his work in a comment on Barra’s Facebook post: “Thanks for everything you’ve done to help build the next computing platform and the whole ecosystem around it,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I’ve learned so much working with you, and I’m excited to see what you build next.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EV startup Canoo under SEC investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xQRigcZvoI3umu9FPQXUjWD6g1Q=/224x193:1535x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301279/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qv92fq"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into newly public electric vehicle startup Canoo, CEO Tony Aquila shared on a conference call on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwoI7w"&gt;The probe is broad, though the startup said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000155837021007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm"&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt; that the SEC has characterized it as a “fact-finding inquiry,” and that the agency has not yet concluded whether anyone violated the law. It covers Canoo’s merger with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC), plus its “operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;the recent departures of certain of the Company’s officers&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Uy3fm"&gt;Canoo says it plans to provide all requested material and fully cooperate. Aquila declined to take any questions about the probe on the call, which was the startup’s second as a public company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vuFg4c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Canoo says it will cooperate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIWmfT"&gt;Canoo is one of a number of electric vehicle startups that went public by merging with a SPAC over the last year. These mergers provided a different path for these startups to go public than a traditional IPO. But since these mergers are regulated differently, it woudn up giving startups more leeway in regards to their business projections. In April, the SEC said it would &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/sec-is-scrutinizing-spac-projections-seeks-clearer-disclosures.html"&gt;start taking a closer look at this discrepancy&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that investors weren’t being misled. Canoo received its notice from the SEC on April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88197m"&gt;A number of other newly-public EV startups are facing pressure from the SEC and various regulators. Lordstown Motors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;disclosed in March that the SEC is investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether the electric pickup truck startup misled investors. Hydrogen trucking startup Nikola also faces investigations from the SEC and the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/nikola-discloses-grand-jury-subpoenas-from-doj.html"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; after being caught lying to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owidSY"&gt;Aquila stressed on the call that Canoo has been overly conservative with its projections to date, and also said the startup will be careful when reporting total deposits for its vehicles versus binding orders. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440287/canoo-electric-van-price-deposit-pickup-truck"&gt;startup began taking deposits&lt;/a&gt; for its electric van, pickup truck, and delivery vehicle earlier Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCGdPO"&gt;Aquila came in as an investor last year around the beginning of the SPAC merger process, and quickly became Canoo’s executive chairman. He has since reoriented the startup’s business to be more focused on commercial vehicle sales. Aquila recently took over as CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;after co-founder and former BMW executive Ulrich Kranz resigned&lt;/a&gt;. Kranz was the latest in a recent rash of departures from the startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etVmQG"&gt;On Canoo’s first quarterly investor call in March, Aquila announced that Canoo was pivoting away from providing engineering services to other companies, effectively killing a deal with Hyundai. He also obliquely referenced how some of the Canoo’s previous leadership made what he felt were “premature” statements about potential partnerships, though the startup was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1376710472263696384"&gt;still promoting the Hyundai deal&lt;/a&gt; in January after he took over as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfmzqH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $549 AirPods Max can’t play lossless Apple Music — even when plugged in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69d9CKC7JVxP7_zIM1EuPJy81d0=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301267/DSCF2705_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r06i0y"&gt;Streaming music might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;entering a new era of hi-fi audio&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple’s AirPods Max aren’t technically ready to go along for the ride. The company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its premium noise-canceling headphones do not natively support playback of lossless music files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnkub0"&gt;“Lossless audio is not supported on AirPods, any model,” an Apple spokesperson said by email. “AirPods Max wired listening mode accepts analog output sources only. AirPods Max currently does not support digital audio formats in wired mode.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq6ELI"&gt;It makes complete sense that the AirPods and AirPods Pro have no way of playing lossless audio. They’re totally wireless, and Apple supports the AAC codec over Bluetooth. AAC sounds plenty good, but it’s nowhere near the bit rate of CD-quality or high-resolution tracks. To do any better, Apple would need to come up with some new wireless codec — its own version of Sony’s LDAC, sort of — or make these things play music over Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth. None of that is happening today or by June when Apple Music will start offering lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shjiBP"&gt;Things are a little more complicated with the AirPods Max, which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be plugged into audio sources with a cable. However, it turns out that even if you have Apple’s $35 Lightning-to-3.5mm cable plugged into a device that’s streaming lossless Apple Music tracks, you’re not going to hear the full audio fidelity of the source. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple AirPods Max in case with iPod and AirPods Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YfLJy784kh1AUCVTFVHU8pIrOkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159226/npatel_201209_4332_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Nilay Patel / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t support digital audio formats when hard wired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qijZy4"&gt;So the natural question becomes... well, what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you hearing in that scenario? Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that when you play a 24-bit / 48 kHz Apple Music lossless track from an iPhone into the AirPods Max using both the cable and Lightning dongle, the audio is converted to analog and then re-digitized to 24-bit / 48 kHz. That re-digitization step is the reason that Apple can’t say you’re hearing pure lossless audio; it’s not an identical match to the source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoOJMd"&gt;Is it still going to sound very good? Almost certainly. The AirPods Max sound exceptional — even with AAC over Bluetooth, and plugging in can make the experience richer. But if you’re a stickler for the technical details, this is why the AirPods Max can’t pull off lossless audio in the truest sense. It also leaves Apple in an awkward spot where other high-end headphones that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; support digital audio when hard wired — over USB-C, for example — could deliver the full lossless audio that the AirPods Max can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4HjWj"&gt;The Apple Music spatial audio feature also announced today &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; work on the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. So any songs that have those Dolby Atmos mixes are going to feel more immersive than their stereo counterparts. I think Apple suspects spatial audio will be a bigger deal for many customers than lossless quality — and it may be right. But hopefully the company also has a long-term plan for increasing the fidelity on its wireless headphones, especially now that lossless doesn’t cost anything extra. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon goes quiet on its Twitch-based Pac-Man game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsQDdUukfDpRPGQkmJ_MmWTm8Lc=/79x0:922x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301024/pic_03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Games and Bandai Namco&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnmAeI"&gt;In May 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;Amazon announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting new version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man &lt;/em&gt;that you’d be able to play right inside Twitch. The game was set to release that June — but recently the company removed all traces of it from the Amazon Games website. Nearly a year after &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to debut, its status remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SePP7C"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;’s page on the Amazon Games website &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wayback Machine has an archived version of the filled-out webpage &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407014742/https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;from April 7th&lt;/a&gt;. This archived version lists a release date of “coming soon” — many months after the original June launch date. And Wario64, who you might know as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, reported that the site wasn’t working &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1383552847120257024"&gt;as recently as mid-April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQoHaS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmT7cS"&gt;There is a live page for the game on Pac-Man’s &lt;a href="https://pacman.com/en/games/livestudio.php"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, which says &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; is “coming soon” and lists Bandai Namco as the developer and Amazon Games as the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvrXLN"&gt;There’s also a live Twitter account, @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playpacmanlive?lang=en"&gt;PlayPacManLive&lt;/a&gt;, that has only &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1263642826018971651"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1280317322842931201"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290349893421211648"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350207553564672"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350895025143809"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;. The latest is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297"&gt;from August 16th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; (in reply to a tweet from an account that no longer exists) saying that “we’re getting closer to having all the pellets in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A3DCbe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're getting closer to having all the pellets in place, and coffee breaks activated. We greatly appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— PAC-MAN LIVE STUDIO (@PlayPacManLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewPnZ2"&gt;When I reached out about the game’s status, Amazon said it forwarded my inquiry about the status of the game to Bandai Namco, which hasn’t responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ExYxX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; could indicate yet another example of an Amazon-backed game failing to materialize. Hero shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20"&gt;last May&lt;/a&gt; but was put back into closed beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt; and eventually canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The studio also canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online roleplaying game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; after a contract dispute with Tencent. (Amazon is still working on its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-will-cost-at-least-465-million.html"&gt;extremely expensive &lt;em&gt;Lord of Rings&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHQ9wH"&gt;And open-world MMO &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Games’ current marquee title (and, I should add, the only one listed in &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games"&gt;the Games section&lt;/a&gt; of the studio’s website), was delayed for the third time from a spring 2021 release to August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRqMbI"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; never comes out, it could also indicate that Amazon is scaling back potential ambitions to offer playable games on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just supposed to let you play the classic &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; mazes you’re familiar with — it’s also set to offer co-op with up to four players and let you create and share your own mazes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="OndETz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10505115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgW81Q"&gt;Of course, many games have been delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear that’s what is happening here, particularly because both Amazon and Bandai Namco have been so quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeFEtr"&gt;Despite Amazon Games’ many recent cancellations, the company recently reiterated support for game development. In response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt; describing problems at the studio, incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a memo internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;also reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating the company’s continued commitment to gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJBEn"&gt;“Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy reportedly wrote. “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS, I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA chief Bill Nelson talks rockets, Moon plans, and partnerships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7VFcZThhQKAEExmGmPg5Mj5osw=/0x0:4496x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300922/_MG_3485.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Nelson on his first few days on the job: ‘I’m drinking from a firehose’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="55j0ie"&gt;As a politician, space was Bill Nelson’s thing. He started out as a state lawmaker near Florida’s Space Coast, ascended to Congress in 1978, then became the House’s first sitting member to actually go to space in 1986, flying as a payload specialist aboard Space Shuttle Columbia. He’d spend three terms in the Senate shaping NASA’s budget and helping steer, from the policy side, NASA’s plans to return to the Moon, before losing a reelection bid in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpl4ln"&gt;Now, he’s on the other side, leading the agency he oversaw for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Q06W"&gt;Sworn in as NASA’s 14th administrator on May 3rd, Nelson helms the space agency at a pivotal moment, with a lot already on his plate. He’s tasked with putting astronauts back on the Moon, sustaining a growing bloc of international partners, shaping the fate of the 20-year-old International Space Station, and boosting NASA’s Earth Sciences wing to play a larger role in studying climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1N5pN"&gt;Like his predecessor, congressman-turned-NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, Nelson wants to leverage his Senate experience to return humans to the Moon by 2024, a deadline set by the Trump administration. President Biden’s transition team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;scoffed&lt;/a&gt; at the 2024 goal as unrealistic, but Nelson is embracing it in a measured approach, holding off on ditching it while acknowledging a moonshot is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FeQzt7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A feud over NASA’s Moon lander award presents the first test of Nelson’s Senate ties&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WuzAB"&gt;He already faces some challenges. Last year, Congress gave NASA only a quarter of what it requested to fund its first ride to the Moon since 1972. The agency, hamstrung by a tight budget, ditched a plan to pick two companies and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;awarded Elon Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; a lone $3 billion contract to tailor its budding Starship rocket for two initial test flights to the lunar surface, including the first astronaut landing in 2024. That spawned a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;wave of opposition from the two losing companies&lt;/a&gt; that were also in the running for the contract, as well as pushback from Nelson’s old buddies in the Senate. They’re calling on NASA to reopen the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mft6ej"&gt;On Friday, May 14th, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; sat down with Nelson, virtually, to chat about his new duties as NASA administrator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePb0s9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZTrNH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you enjoying your new gig at NASA? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzB1T3"&gt;I’m drinking from a firehose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wbIQD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ha, what’s that like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9qr9D"&gt;It’s like trying to take sips of water with an avalanche of water coming at you. [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] I’m having a ball, is the true statement. Of course, this is a subject matter that I have had some experience in and I’m passionate about. It’s just a great privilege for me to have been nominated and confirmed for this job. So we got a lot going on this year, and you’ll be seeing these things unfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fjXoJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like your first big test is this Human Landing System dilemma we’re seeing unfold, with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bid protests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Maria Cantwell’s amendment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; aiming to reopen the competition that SpaceX won. Have you put your Senate experience to use and talked to your Senate buddies about this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RBo5oP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Congress has got to do its part”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOYs1L"&gt;So. I’ve been having a lot of conversations with senators, congressmen, and particularly their staff, and White House staff as well. This is about the budget, and I’ve been making the case that we need vigorous competition going forward on the Human Landing System. And of course, everything’s frozen up until the first of August, with the protest of the SpaceX award. Depending on how that goes, either way, we’re going to need the competition. Maria Cantwell, at my confirmation hearing, was talking about that. And of course, I assured her that competition is good, and you get greater efficiencies and greater performance out of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odERqS"&gt;But Congress has got to do its part. And that is to prepare, plan for, and provide the money so we can have a vigorous competition and have more than one awardee. In last year’s budget, NASA had requested $3.4 billion for this competition, and Congress came up with $850 million. You just can’t do the competition with that kind of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMfmXw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the protest litigation pending, and without much funding, it’s unclear if NASA can simply add another company to work alongside SpaceX. But with this 2024 goal in mind, do you think quickly reopening the HLS competition to add another company, alongside SpaceX, should be the way to go? Or should those other companies wait to take advantage of future competitions?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUUYSh"&gt;Well, if SpaceX’s award is not overturned, and you continue as a result of the Government Accountability Office saying that SpaceX is the winner, then what you have to do is look at all these follow-on contracts. SpaceX’s award is for only a demonstration flight that would land humans and return them to Earth safely. Then you get into the use contracts — and there’ll be many of them — and that’s what the competition will be for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KApUg"&gt;If the bid protest is successful, then you have to start the original competition over again, and that’s where Congress hopefully will provide the resources in which to do a vigorous competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWXmBq"&gt;The SpaceX award says they can land on the Moon in 2024. Of course, we know that space is hard, that because of developing technology and the unique environment of space and so forth, history often tells us that you get delays. But 2024 is the schedule as outlined in the award, and that’s what we’re planning for — at the same time recognizing the sobering reality that space is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then-nominee for NASA administrator Bill Nelson bumps elbows with Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate commerce committee that oversees NASA, after his confirmation hearing on April 21st, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1mZHyW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about NASA’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338638/nasa-space-launch-system-hot-fire-test"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Launch System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;How do you view the future of SLS? What role should SLS play long-term in NASA’s vision for the Moon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bWCGE"&gt;Remember the context, that SLS was conceived when we passed that NASA bill 11 years ago that set NASA on the dual course mandate. The commercial course, and then the other course, was to get NASA out of low-Earth orbit and go explore beyond LEO. It was felt at the time that we needed to get going, and we saw the opportunities under the advice of NASA to take a lot of the technologies that had been developing for the Space Shuttle, enhance them, and utilize them into what is today the SLS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49t9g"&gt;The SLS, as we speak, is being stacked in the Vehicle Assembly Building at [Kennedy Space Center]. So I think there’s going to be a vigorous future for the SLS, and it will take our astronauts into the vicinity of the Moon, into what is called a cislunar orbit. So yes, there will be a lot of activity with the SLS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJh70e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some folks in the space community who criticize the SLS program as being a kind of jobs program and that, despite the rocket’s proven shuttle hardware, the cost and design of commercial rockets have evolved significantly since Congress initiated that dual course objective. Would you agree with that at all? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Nyp7"&gt;Remember, space is hard. And the SLS is getting ready to fly. The others that were the ones in the competition, none of those have flown. So you have to build step by step. So put it in context as you’re evaluating that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuGUEe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On climate and Earth sciences — the Biden administration has vowed to boost the country’s edge in tackling climate change. What kind of new investments and programs are we going to see for climate science and green aviation in NASA’s budget request coming up? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaEkRt"&gt;As I said at my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395950/bill-nelson-backs-nasas-moon-plans-climate-change-work-in-confirmation-hearing"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to mitigate climate change, you have to measure it. And who does that? That’s NASA that builds the spacecraft. So take, for example, we’re going to be putting up Landsat 9, and this is after 50 years of Landsat in partnership with the [United States Geological Survey]. NASA provides repetitive imaging and it shows, over that half-century, what’s happening in the human interaction with the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHP3p1"&gt;I could clearly see that 36 years ago with the naked eye from the window of a spacecraft. I could see, for example, going across the southern tip of Africa and out over the Indian Ocean. And lo and behold, there’s the island nation of Madagascar, and they had cut down all the trees on Madagascar. And when the rains came, there was no vegetation to hold the topsoil. The topsoil went down the rivers, and you could clearly see that from space. All the mouths of the rivers had discolored significantly that bright blue color of the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgcEvX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to switch to international partnerships. As a senator, you sometimes took tough stances on Russia. You frequently called them out in 2018 for their hacking of Florida elections systems. Now you’re at NASA, where Russia is one of its biggest partners in space. Will you have to switch your views a bit with regard to Russia, and what future do you see for NASA’s partnership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AODUKp"&gt;Russia has been our partner ever since the ice was broken in the middle of the Cold War in 1975, with Apollo-Soyuz. We have built the International Space Station with them. I believe that, as long as we’re involved in the space station, Russia will continue to be our partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WAsbNF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I see a continuing, close cooperation” with Russia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDp6lE"&gt;You probably know that I want to expand the life of the station to 2030* and the idea would eventually be that you let private industry build the space station thereafter. And NASA could concentrate on the continuing exploration of the cosmos. But I see a continuing close cooperation. Regardless of the statements that you hear coming from time to time that would indicate otherwise, I just think, at the end of the day, Russia’s going to continue to be our partner. I think we have to watch the things like Russia and China saying that they’re going to cooperate on landing on the Moon, but it’s a big difference saying that than doing it. So I want to continue the partnership with the Russians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgygrg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your view on partnering with China? Through the Wolf Amendment, NASA is largely barred from partnering with China. Many former NASA officials have supported the idea of working more with China, as they &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;court NASA allies like Russia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. And Pam Melroy, your incoming deputy, last year was &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/20/biden-china-space-448529"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;quoted by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as saying that trying to exclude China “is a failing strategy.” Do you agree with her on that, and should NASA engage with China?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8ed2Z"&gt;Well, it is the law. And until the law is changed, we’re going to adhere to the law. There are obvious things that, regardless of the law, you can still cooperate with China on. For example, if China is successful in landing a lander today on Mars, there are things that we can share. [Editor’s Note: a few hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436072/china-tianwen-1-mars-landing-zhurong-rover"&gt;it landed successfully&lt;/a&gt;.] Going forward in the future, there are things that we need to share with China, such as the avoidance of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422791/china-long-march-5b-uncontrollable-rocket-stage-crash-low-risk-public"&gt;space junk&lt;/a&gt;. So there are many, many things like that where you can really have a cooperative relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blTFyg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given the state of growing Russia-China relations right now, do you think that law, the Wolf Amendment, should be changed? Or would you make any effort to change the Wolf Amendment? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyeH8z"&gt;Give me a while to be in the saddle, and then I’ll answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7svgDz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for chatting, Bill. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmSEa5"&gt;My pleasure. Call us anytime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujErH3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Correction, May 17th 6:20PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;In an initial version of this interview, Nelson said he expects the International Space Station’s lifetime to end in 2023. He misspoke, and meant 2030, a spokesperson said. The station’s current lifespan extension lasts until 2024, and as a senator, Nelson pushed for a 2030 extension. He still supports the 2030 date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants you to know it chose not to take a cut of $400 billion in physical goods </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phil schiller stock 2015" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRuNIiR8ZxOfS5m6Tc5J9TCzqA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300846/verge-2015-09-09_12-31-45.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUS15t"&gt;Apple is trying to convince a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423567/apple-epic-app-store-policies-fortnite-trial-day-4"&gt;that it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; milking the App Store for all it’s worth&lt;/a&gt;, and today the company dropped some big numbers to help make its case. Apple claims that its App Store drove $400 billion worth of physical purchases in a single year in 2019, and that — unlike digital purchases and subscriptions — Apple doesn’t take a cent of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMyZWo"&gt;That’s according to App Store boss and longtime Apple marketing exec Phil Schiller, who also testified that the company spends a staggering $50 million a year to throw its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. The company’s also building a new developer center at its Apple Loop headquarters in Cupertino, he says, though I didn’t catch how much the company’s investing in that. None of these are included in the App Store’s budget, Schiller testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ok6hdJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller says in 2019 App Store drove $400 billion+ in transactions of physical goods, so food delivery, Amazon, Uber/Lyft, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judge interjects. “Billion with a b?” It’s a big number, and Schiller confirms Apple doesn’t take a cut of that.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Statt (@nickstatt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickstatt/status/1394363213932863488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kScH5F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Schiller’s going over the explanation Apple has given before for why it doesn’t take a commission on physical goods: it can’t guarantee they actually arrive. (This logic goes for things like Lyft/Uber as well, per earlier discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1394362691859492869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6t7Er"&gt;Why isn’t Apple trying to take a cut of physical purchases? During his testimony, Schiller explained that Apple couldn’t guarantee they would actually arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9F1N9L"&gt;But I also imagine it might have been a hard sell with developers: can Apple really argue that it drove those $400 billion in purchases by itself? If I’m going to buy something online, I’ll probably start by whipping out my phone, but I’ve got a laptop with a perfectly good web browser right here to buy those same items, if an app doesn’t immediately do the job. Amazon knows this, and used it to bypass Apple’s digital cut on movies and shows, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"&gt;until it got a better deal&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"&gt;Digital books are a different matter&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GwhEyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Read Steve Jobs’ emails about why you can’t buy digital books in Amazon’s apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller"},{"title":"Why Amazon got out of the Apple App Store tax, and why other developers won’t","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j1bzfO"&gt;Even without a cut of physical purchases, Apple’s App Store cut is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;estimated to rake in $64 billion for the company each year&lt;/a&gt;, with profit margins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;approaching a ludicrous 78 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Apple seems to attempting to argue that because things like WWDC aren’t included in the App Store’s costs, the real profit margin is lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oqDxaI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;basically, we are establishing in the law’s tedious way there are lots of App Store benefits that aren’t really… the App Store itself. attempting to undermine Epic’s claims about the profit margin, and establish that the App Store can’t be separated from the phone itself.&lt;/p&gt;— Elizabeth Lopatto (@mslopatto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1394410945896607745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dXfgHH"&gt;Schiller testified that 84 percent of all App Store apps are completely free, with roughly 75 percent of all games on the App Store completely free. Of those games, approximately 17 percent are freemium (requiring in-app purchases to unlock content) and 6 percent are paid, leaving just 2 percent on a subscription model if we do the math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WH4w2j"&gt;Schiller also said today that Apple has spent $100 billion on research and development over the past fifteen years, $18 billion of that just last year in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8LMI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 6:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added line and embedded tweet about the point Apple appears to be trying to make today by touting all of its investments in the iPhone and iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is showing off new foldable tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTk_hAE5ag1ZXNCS4g7AKUWtiz0=/0x15:820x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300675/foldable_concept.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s display division is working on a bi-folding OLED panel suitable for folding phones.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8J1SSe"&gt;This year has seen no shortage of rollable display demos from manufacturers, and now Samsung Display is the latest company to show off new concepts for folding and sliding screens. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsungs-new-foldable-and-udc-panels-reveal-an-exciting-future/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; the concepts being showcased as part of a virtual Display Week exhibition (if you forgot to mail out your Happy Display Week cards, there’s still time since it &lt;a href="http://www.displayweek.org/"&gt;runs through Friday&lt;/a&gt;) including a “multi-foldable” mobile display and a large 17-inch folding screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRlPZr"&gt;The company calls its first concept S-foldable, with a bi-fold design that opens up to a maximum screen size of 7.2 inches. It’s similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; except, well, plus one fold. There’s also a sliding mobile display similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;ill-fated rollable concept&lt;/a&gt; LG showed off earlier this year before leaving the smartphone space altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BQ1emc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8S0EHO"&gt;Samsung Display is also showing two concepts for bigger panels, including a 17-inch foldable OLED that’s tablet-sized when folded and can function as a monitor when unfolded. Finally, there’s a more traditional-looking laptop display; it doesn’t fold or flex, but it does include an under-display camera — hopefully it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;better than the last one&lt;/a&gt; we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prKcyC"&gt;Samsung Display is a division of Samsung Electronics, and it produces OLED panels for use by Samsung and other consumer tech manufacturers. So while these concepts may end up in future Samsung products, it’s certainly not guaranteed. The company as a whole hasn’t been shy about embracing foldable technology, getting into the foldable device market early. It may have more company soon; display OEM TCL has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;shown off its own concepts&lt;/a&gt; and says it will bring one to market this year. Until then, we’ll be watching and filling out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;foldable concept&lt;/a&gt; bingo cards.&lt;/p&gt;
