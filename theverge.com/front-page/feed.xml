    <title>Lina Khan is just the first step toward tougher US tech regulation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pwkcpz_OHD5jfCePOn4K1YkAaSg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013141/acastro_170711_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kIGNoR"&gt;President Joe Biden picked one of tech’s most ardent critics, Lina Khan, to join the Federal Trade Commission on Monday. For Democrats and progressives, Khan’s nomination was a sign that the Biden administration may be the toughest one in history when it comes to tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vs6QPN"&gt;“We need all hands on deck as we work to take on some of the biggest monopolies in the world, and President Biden is making his commitment to competition clear,” Senate antitrust committee leader Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRlOY0"&gt;Even White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said to expect more tech scrutiny from Biden earlier this year. “The president has been clear — on the campaign, and, probably, more recently — that he stands up to the abuse of power, and that includes the abuse of power from big technology companies and their executives,” Psaki said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cHx6HH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Khan and other anti-tech progressives will be working against decades of inertia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rg3IWE"&gt;But even if optimism is high for the incoming FTC, Khan and other anti-tech progressives will be working against decades of inertia. Khan would only be one vote on a commission of five with a tattered history of sorry settlements and deals with companies like Facebook and Google. Over the years, antitrust enforcers have been starved of the resources necessary for taking on complicated and lengthy competition cases, and there are real concerns about whether the FTC will have the resources or legal authority to take on Big Tech, no matter who’s at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv3PhU"&gt;With Khan replacing Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra, Biden has one more seat to fill before Democrats have a 3-2 majority at the agency and can begin filing suits or making settlements. For the interim, Acting Chair Rebecca Slaughter is leading the FTC, but Biden hasn’t announced who he’ll officially nominate to lead the agency. It’s unclear if Biden’s FTC chair will be as skeptical of tech’s market power as Khan and Slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyEgEh"&gt;Before being nominated to the FTC, Khan burst onto the antitrust scene after publishing a legal paper called the “Amazon Antitrust Paradox.” It became immediately popular with tech critics. Shortly after, Khan worked as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee’s 16-month probe into giant tech firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. That investigation produced a 400-page report from Democrats calling for new laws to better help law enforcement agencies like the FTC take on antitrust cases against tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMLANe"&gt;“My strategy is you’ll see a number of bills introduced, both because it’s harder for (the tech companies) to manage and oppose, you know, 10 bills as opposed to one,” House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8bgUX"&gt;That work is still beginning, but the House has signaled that it plans to introduce legislation that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338763/facebook-google-antitrust-cicilline-ftc-slaughter-monopoly"&gt;beef up the FTC later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Republicans and Democrats agree on &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-tech-antitrust-agenda-30a7bcc7-22ee-4897-93ec-99f6aaf577d4.html"&gt;a handful of measures&lt;/a&gt; to help the FTC take on tech. These proposals range from legislating more funding for enforcers to pay for lengthy legal battles against wealthy tech companies. &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/its-ridiculous-underfunded-us-regulators"&gt;As Alex Kantrowitz wrote in &lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last year, the FTC’s budget is less than $350 million a year, while Facebook makes billions every quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ6L6U"&gt;Lawmakers have also proposed changing &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-unveils-sweeping-antitrust-bill-laying-out-her-vision-as-new-subcommittee-chair-.html"&gt;the burden of proof&lt;/a&gt; for proposed mergers so that large companies would have to prove that their acquisitions aren’t anti-competitive before they’re allowed to finalize them. This would put more of the onus on huge tech firms when they decide to buy up a nascent company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7phaHX"&gt;The FTC isn’t the only agency with the authority to challenge tech monopolies. Earlier this month, the Senate confirmed Merrick Garland as US attorney general. When Garland was first nominated in January, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/big-tech-faces-a-formidable-opponent-in-merrick-garland-as-ag-190800859.html"&gt;experts pointed to his antitrust experience&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that he would crack down on Big Tech. Still, Biden has yet to nominate anyone to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, and &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/biden-big-tech-antitrust-renata-hesse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that two attorneys who previously advised tech companies were in the running for the role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4WSQ1"&gt;Biden still has a lot of work to do before his administration truly pivots away from the Silicon Valley coziness of the Obama administration. But if the White House and Congress get to work, the FTC could pose a significant and immediate threat to the growing power of Big Tech.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Black Shark 4 is a high-end gaming phone that doesn’t look like one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGL_i_mPrY1EJJPr0AAesrtdPfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013017/blackshark4lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Shark&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b0JyVN"&gt;Xiaomi’s Black Shark brand has announced its fourth series of gaming phones, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro. They improve on the previous series in most of the ways you’d expect them to. There’s a faster processor, moving up to the Snapdragon 870 in the standard Black Shark 4 and the Snapdragon 888 in the 4 Pro. Both phones also come with fast LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, though each will come in different configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRMexn"&gt;The Black Shark 4 starts with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for 2,499 Chinese yuan (roughly $383), while the 4 Pro starts at 3,999 yuan (about $613) and has 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. These will debut in China on Friday, March 26th, while the company says an overseas launch will happen “in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_Mx00wD3oxIHN5IALpYcuXk53Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391953/blackshark4sidebyside.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESP2tF"&gt;As is almost a given in the realm of gaming phones, Black Shark has leap-frogged Asus and RedMagic — some of its biggest competition in the niche gaming phone space — when it comes to touch sampling rate or how many times the display can register a touch. Both the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have a 720Hz touch sampling rate with a 8.3ms touch delay, which it claims to be an industry best. This spec likely won’t make a difference in most people’s day-to-day usage of these phones, but some hardcore gamers might care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLrvVy"&gt;Both phones have the mechanical shoulder buttons introduced in the previous Black Shark phones, though the company claims it has improved their look and feel with “magnetic power lift” tech, making them feel more tactile to click, as well as fitting more seamlessly into the phone’s design. Speaking on the look of these new phones, they’re decidedly more attractive than the previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6jLWEc3wGctuQNIizIKHw8NDRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333859/jbareham_190611_3481_0177.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Black Shark 2, which introduced the pressure-sensitive display that lets you map two functions to one spot on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRWYlT"&gt;In addition to the shoulder buttons, these phones still have a pressure-sensitive display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;I really liked in the Black Shark 2&lt;/a&gt;. With the shoulder buttons and a screen like this, you can re-map the controls of a mobile game to be a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWJFBm"&gt;Unlike last year’s model, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have displays that are the same size. They both have 6.67-inch OLED screens with a 144Hz refresh rate. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that I recently reviewed, these phones have dual front-facing speakers with claims that they have good spatial audio separation. Also like that Asus phone, Black Shark announced that a fan accessory called the FunCooler 2 Pro can be attached to keep it cooler. The price for that is 199 yuan (about $30).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grogu never stops eating, and now there’s a toy to match his appetite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3Vg2X539j-tUnVnZ8FDGuRgGR0=/0x122:1136x879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012777/Hasbro_Star_Wars_Galactic_Snackin_Grogu_oop_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bXz4q7"&gt;If you’ve watched even just an episode of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know this: Grogu is always hungry. The little guy, previously known as Baby Yoda, is constantly snacking, whether it’s on endangered frog eggs or newly spawned spider monsters. Sometimes, he just needs a nice cup of bone broth to tide him over. And soon there will be an animatronic toy to match his appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7Or18VtAUsqBySAQtxporT4qN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391912/STAR_WARS_GALACTIC_SNACKIN__GROGU___oop__6_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3GUS"&gt;Today, Hasbro announced &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/galactic-snackin-grogu"&gt;Galactic Snackin’ Grogu&lt;/a&gt; — that’s the product’s actual name — which will release in October for $79.99. You can feed him with a spoon, let him munch on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21612698/mandalorian-cookie-macarons-the-child-williams-sonoma-star-wars-price"&gt;some strange blue cookies&lt;/a&gt;, or just give him a bowl of live squid. Given his propensity to eat anything, even if it gets him in trouble, the limited options are probably a good thing. Hasbro says that lil’ Grogu will let you know when he likes something or “what belongs in a trash compactor.” He’s also got some force powers and can levitate his favorite toy that he stole from the Mandalorian’s ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccq2Wu"&gt;This is actually the second animatronic Grogu, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/21/21146913/baby-yoda-animatronic-toy-hasbro-release-date-price-mandalorian-star-wars-disney"&gt;one last year that could coo and fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;. Hasbro’s senior design director Vickie Stratford says that when it came to creating a follow-up, “the concept of snacking opened up many fun ideas for our design and development team to create an all-new interactive experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KjH59"&gt;Hasbro says the toy will be available to preorder today at “most major retailers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s upcoming mixed reality headset will reportedly weigh less than an iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-tG9aJPA9Q3VcqUo3lETRVJlvY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012767/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQUkPC"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored mixed reality headset could weigh less than 150 grams, which would make it much lighter than many other headsets on the market, according to a new research note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-to-have-ultra-short-focal-length-lenses-and-weigh-less-than-150-grams/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That lighter weight might mean Apple’s headset could be easier to wear for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZQuSz"&gt;A weight of 150 grams would make Apple’s headset lighter than the Oculus Quest 2 (503 grams), Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 (645 grams), and the Valve Index (809 grams). It would be lighter than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/4/13161506/google-vr-headset-photos-daydream-view-virtual-reality"&gt;Google’s Daydream View&lt;/a&gt;, a fabric VR headset designed to hold your phone, which weighed 220 grams. The headset could even be lighter than your iPhone, given that the standard iPhone 12 weighs 164 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tWljz"&gt;As attractively light as this headset sounds, though, it might be a while until we get to try it out for ourselves. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in January that the device, which may have both virtual reality and augmented reality features, won’t launch until at least 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; backed that up in February by reporting that the device could ship “as early as next year.” &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also had a drawing of what the headset could look like, including mesh fabric in the front and Apple Watch-style bands in the back, and I could see how the device could be very light if made with those materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEEyykaSpa2_RPdULlxgpgJj3aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280992/3b786602_c662_4696_b68c_21f89e4a4e95.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nn176"&gt;The headset, codenamed “N301,” may also have 8K displays, eye-tracking technology, and more than a dozen cameras to both track your hand movements and capture footage that can be displayed inside the headset, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. And in his new research note, Kuo reported that the device will have plastic lenses, an ultra-short focal length, and Micro-OLED displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFOeCS"&gt;But the headset may not be cheap: Apple has apparently discussed pricing the headset at around $3,000, &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported. That would make it much more expensive than the $299 Oculus Quest 2 but more affordable than the $3,500 HoloLens 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OYFR8"&gt;Apple’s device has already hit several development challenges, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, and given how far out the rumored headset is, there’s always a possibility that details about the device could change. However, Apple recently moved Dan Riccio, its former hardware chief, into a role &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272555/apple-dan-riccio-ar-vr-development"&gt;reportedly overseeing&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s AR and VR devices, which could signal the company’s commitment to launching a device sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. will return to theatrical releases in 2022, ending its HBO Max experiment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kBQZZzvARb40BvN9mhwPai5PNMo=/220x0:804x389/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012723/pattinson_batman.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="weHquJ"&gt;Warner Bros. will return to releasing its theatrical films exclusively in theaters next year, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/cineworld-regal-warner-bros-deal-theatrical-windows-us-cinemas-reopening-1234719255/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;ends the studio’s 2021 experiment&lt;/a&gt; of releasing major films like &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Dune&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt; simultaneously on its HBO Max streaming service and in theaters for the first 30 days they’re released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zTlA1"&gt;The news comes as part of an announcement from Warner Bros. of a new deal with Regal cinemas owner Cineworld, the second largest theater chain in the world. After over six months of shutdowns, Regal’s theaters will reopen in April, and they’ll begin showing Warner Bros. films like &lt;em&gt;Kong vs. Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; alongside their HBO Max debuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30lFZl"&gt;When Warner Bros. films come back to theaters in 2022, Regal theaters will once again have full exclusivity (with no HBO Max or paid streaming rental competition). But that exclusivity window will be for a much shorter amount of time: Regal will only have a 45-day theatrical exclusivity window, half of the 90-day standard that existed in years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="np5RCk"&gt;The shortened theatrical window matches recent changes from other studios instigated by the COVID-19 pandemic’s devastating effects on the film business. Paramount &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;recently announced similar 45-day windows&lt;/a&gt; for its blockbuster films like &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficepro.com/paramount-cuts-down-theatrical-exclusivity-for-major-titles-to-30-45-day-window/"&gt;an even shorter 30-day window&lt;/a&gt; for smaller titles. Universal has also signed similar deals with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wall-street-is-reacting-to-cinemark-universal-theatrical-window-deal"&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt;: films with openings less than $50 million domestically will hit paid video services 17 days after they debut, while movies with larger opening weekends can start paid rentals 31 days after debuting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuHBjO"&gt;Disney has similarly been experimenting with day and date premium streaming releases through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;Disney Plus Premiere Access&lt;/a&gt; program, which has offered films like &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;early for an additional $30 fee. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube won’t remove a three-hour live-streamed video of the mass shooting in Boulder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gunman Opens Fires At Grocery Store In Boulder, Colorado" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dq5pQuyEwPAIJYc9e7BfBs2G5w=/0x0:3143x2095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012697/1231881876.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chet Strange / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEykZ"&gt;YouTube says the platform will not remove a controversial live-streamed video of a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, despite criticism of the streamer’s tactics and commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBbeEq"&gt;“Following yesterday’s tragic shooting, bystander video of the incident was detected by our teams. While violent content intended to shock or disgust viewers is not allowed on YouTube, we do allow videos with enough news or documentary context,” YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We applied an age restriction to the content and will continue to monitor the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uemb1r"&gt;The live stream was broadcast from around the King Soopers supermarket in Boulder; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8vn9/boulder-shooting-livestream-not-being-pulled-by-youtube"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it reached a live audience that peaked at around 30,000 people and has since been viewed around 585,000 times. The streamer, Dean Schiller, began recording inside the supermarket soon after the attack. He continued recording from outside for more than three hours, despite police requests for him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qxCUih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The video has been viewed around half a million times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bM2SOR"&gt;Schiller has identified himself in the past as a citizen journalist, and in 2019, he and another videographer were &lt;a href="https://www.westword.com/news/citizen-journalists-discuss-lawsuit-against-boulder-cops-11381112"&gt;arrested and jailed for filming&lt;/a&gt; around the Boulder County Jail, following a series of videos that captured alleged police misconduct. But as &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; notes, Schiller has been criticized on several fronts for the shooting video. Some video commenters called him out for not dialing 911 or attempting to help people fleeing the building, while some &lt;a href="https://gazette.com/news/local/man-who-live-streamed-shooting-scene-at-king-soopers-well-known-to-boulder-cops/article_9d43b086-8b6a-11eb-9987-6f7ca1b5bb4c.html"&gt;other news outlets&lt;/a&gt; and anti-extremism researchers criticized him for speculating on the shooter’s motives, revealing police tactics, and briefly filming the bodies of victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5AAH"&gt;Yesterday’s shooting in Boulder left 10 people dead, and a police spokesperson &lt;a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/03/23/king-soopers-shooting-ahmad-al-issa-suspected-killing-10/"&gt;said the alleged killer&lt;/a&gt; was taken into custody after being shot in the leg by a police officer. Police have not offered a motive for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBTiS9"&gt;Videos of murder have created a quandary for social network moderators who are tasked with distinguishing between meaningful journalism and content that could inspire copycat attacks or play into a killer’s search for publicity. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have scrambled to remove video directly recorded by mass shooters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;including a 2019 attack&lt;/a&gt; on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. But they’ve also been criticized for &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/facebook-blames-technical-glitch-for-temporary-removal-of-falcon-heights-shooting-video/"&gt;removing video&lt;/a&gt; documenting newsworthy events like police shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2OGScb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mass shooting videos can amplify an attack’s harm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWTfPh"&gt;Platforms have also responded by surfacing trusted news outlets or by limiting the reach of controversial posts, even if they’re not banned outright. But YouTube didn’t outline any specific steps it had taken on Schiller’s video beyond requiring users to log in and verify their age before viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfILwP"&gt;The video also plays into long-standing questions about how journalists should responsibly cover violence. While some YouTube comments called the video a negative byproduct of social media reporting, others drew parallels with sensationalist coverage in older mediums like TV news — comparing Schiller to the protagonist of the 2014 film &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbjLdF"&gt;Traditional media outlets have gradually reevaluated their playbook for reporting on mass shootings in recent years. That includes trying to avoid an inordinate focus on the shooter or unsubstantiated speculation about their motives, particularly in the early stages of an incident, when very little is known about the attack. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reportingonmassshootings.org/"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; also include avoiding graphic violence that’s posted without a clear purpose — and could add to the trauma of people who have survived the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1More ComfoBuds Pro review: comfortably sound</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A supremely comfortable fit, decent noise cancellation, and good sound for $100&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wn3Rdw"&gt;1More has absolutely flooded the true wireless earbud market, and it’s confident enough in its new ComfoBuds Pro noise-canceling earbuds to proclaim them as superior to the AirPods Pro — for a fraction of the price. They slot in between the company’s flagship True Wireless ANC earbuds ($200) and less expensive options like the $50 PistonsBuds and the standard ComfoBuds, the latter of which has an open-style design. 1More says with the Pro model, it’s “sure to bring the fight to Apple and give their loyal fanbase a serious dilemma in choosing what pair of earbuds are right for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77B5I1"&gt;I don’t think forcing such a direct comparison was the right move because, despite 1More claiming that it offers “so much more” than Apple’s flagship buds, the ComfoBuds Pro can’t match up with the AirPods Pro in all areas — as is expected with such a price discrepancy — but they’re still an excellent product in their own right. The sound is fantastic for the money, they have several useful noise cancellation modes to switch between, and the fit certainly delivers on the “comfort” part of their name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mfr91j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10408076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5DN0G"&gt;The ComfoBuds come in either gunmetal gray or white, and they lay flat in their elongated, capsule-shaped carrying case. This makes for a compact, pocketable design, but the trade-off is that removing them from the case isn’t so simple: you’ve got to press down on the stem, which pushes up the main earbud portion, and then pluck that out of the case. Once you’ve done it a few times, you’ll have it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lMwOH1svd0ySZRlLFEsGYk3Bgpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391105/DSCF3313_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Removing the ComfoBuds Pro from the case takes a bit more effort than some other earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="USJq86"&gt;LEDs hidden at the bottom of the teardrop stem indicate pairing and charge status, and there’s also a light on the case’s exterior so you know when they’re fully topped off. Battery life is rated at 6 hours with ANC enabled, which outlasts the 4.5-hour AirPods Pro. The case has enough extra juice for you to reach 20 hours of total listening time. It charges over USB-C but doesn’t offer wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdIyRp"&gt;1More also beats out Apple on the scale, with each ComfoBud Pro weighing 5.2 grams compared to the 5.4-gram AirPods Pro. In your ears, they feel similarly light and barely there. This results in comfort that lasts over extended stretches, which can’t always be said of heavier options like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (8.5 grams) and Jabra Elite 85t (7 grams). Four sets of silicone tips come in the box, with an extra small size thrown in alongside the standard small, medium, and large. I’d have appreciated an XL option, as even the largest size took some adjustment for a snug seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QUcBQ"&gt;Instead of any actual buttons, the ComfoBuds Pro have a touch-sensitive area on the outer stem. It works well enough, even if it’s not obvious exactly where you should be tapping. The most confounding thing about 1More’s controls is there’s no single-tap action. You can choose what happens with a double tap, long press, or triple tap, but the single-press option — commonly used by other manufacturers to play / pause — just doesn’t exist here. So although 1More lets you customize the controls that are here, you’re a bit limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUA9cR2tdvVvGunisdOsJsDECBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390473/DSCF3307_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds come in dark gray or white, and both have red accents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yx0mKUo42dnDAp8vMg0VPTjS-wU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390475/DSCF3312_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four sizes of ear tips are included, including an XS pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FUQVvZ"&gt;By default, two taps is pause, three activates a voice assistant, and a long press toggles between the noise-canceling modes. I ended up switching the three-tap gesture to track controls, but that meant settling for no direct volume access. Each earbud has an IR sensor on the outside for auto-pause if you remove them. They reliably resumed the music whenever I put them back in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AQU4K"&gt;1More has a good reputation for delivering on sound quality, and I think the ComfoBuds Pro might set a new bar for what to expect if you’re on a $100 budget. They’ve got excellent clarity without the bass bloat that’s common in this price bracket. Everything gets its ample space in the mix; the many layered vocal tracks by Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon on “Exile” are all distinct and come through with clarity. The funky groove of Lake Street Dive’s “Hypotheticals” is a good demo for the punchy bass these earbuds are capable of. Usually, there’s one genre or even a style of music production that will expose the weaknesses of a particular set of earbuds, but I struggled to find that with the ComfoBuds Pro. They can adapt to pretty much anything without coming off as harsh or thin. 1More doesn’t include any options for EQ customization, so what you get is what you get. Either earbud can be used standalone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kblBfSsQK14EoVc7ykyzX-x71JE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391515/DSCF3323_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You control the ComfoBuds Pro with tap gestures on the stem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QWJi8V"&gt;But do they sound &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the AirPods Pro? You could make the case they do, yeah. I think some people will prefer the deeper low tones and how much wider 1More’s earbuds can feel; vocals stay planted in the center, but you’ll hear a ton of detail out of the left and right channels. Still, there’s something to be said for the no-nonsense, straightforward audio reproduction of the AirPods Pro that so many people find pleasing across all sorts of different audio. 1More’s pricier True Wireless ANC also sound a bit fuller and more precise since they have a dual-driver design compared to the single 13.4-millimeter driver in the ComfoBuds Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="MoO6Ww"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10408196"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="elUrAo"&gt;These earbuds offer a few different levels of noise cancellation intensity. There’s the default “strong” option, which goes the furthest in quieting outside noise. But 1More also includes a less powerful mode it says is suitable for “chatty” environments like cafes and offices, plus another that’s meant to avoid wind noise, which is common with noise-canceling earbuds since they constantly use the exterior microphones to sample ambient sound. If you’re outside on a windy day, that could be a good trick to lean on. (These latter two modes require the 1More mobile app to activate.) Finally, there’s a full-on transparency mode for getting a clear sense of everything happening around you. 1More’s active noise cancellation worked pretty well when I was sitting outside at a Brooklyn coffee shop, but this is one area where the AirPods Pro pull ahead. They don’t have the same variety of modes, but Apple’s premium earbuds do a better overall job of bringing down the volume of the outside world, which is what’s most important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lVJc_Tgi25jNbLY1BxIFFUDs0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391101/DSCF3314_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case is compact but lacks wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="99znVa"&gt;Even so, all of these things make the ComfoBuds Pro a great value. But the AirPods Pro still rank above in several respects. First, the ComfoBuds Pro case doesn’t support wireless charging. Second, Apple’s transparency mode still sounds more natural and airy than 1More’s. And 1More can’t match the software flexes (automatic switching, spatial audio, seamless pairing, audio sharing, etc.) that exist between AirPods and other Apple devices. That’s a huge part of what makes them so popular. Again, we’re talking about quality-of-life conveniences that you’d rightfully expect from a $250 product. And these cost nowhere near that. But if 1More is going to make the comparison, the differences are worth pointing out. Despite putting a huge focus on voice mic performance, 1More also winds up behind the AirPods Pro there — as does everyone else. It’s a draw on sweat resistance, with both sets of earbuds rated IPX4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wIJ9Xv"&gt;1More has put together a fantastic pair of budget earbuds with the ComfoBuds Pro. I wish the company had focused on the sheer value you get in exchange for your $99 instead of trying to take down the AirPods Pro, which just isn’t realistic. Despite matching them on comfort and edging them out in other areas like battery life, there are still valid reasons why many iPhone owners will go right for Apple’s buds. It’s hard to put a price on those exclusive Apple ecosystem features and the superior noise cancellation. But if you’ve only got around $100 to put toward earbuds, the ComfoBuds Pro are a standout pair that won’t leave you missing much else. Only thing is, the AirPods are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;far from the only competition&lt;/a&gt; they’ll need to stand out from. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is opening a new game studio in Montreal led by Rainbow Six Siege developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M336WsQ3YmSNS3eci5cLSMXNdfQ=/43x0:538x330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69012408/580x330_montreal_games.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXBgNW"&gt;Amazon is illustrating its commitment to game development with a new studio opening, despite its struggles to make a hit game in recent years. The company on Tuesday announced the &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/amazon-games-opens-development-studio-montreal"&gt;new studio’s Montreal-based&lt;/a&gt; team, which will create original AAA games with an initial focus on a new online multiplayer title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ho91PK"&gt;The new studio will be led by industry veterans who worked on Ubisoft’s &lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege&lt;/em&gt;. Amazon Games’ Montreal studio is its fourth studio, with three other locations based in Seattle, San Diego, and Orange County.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcdoHE"&gt;“Building upon 8 years of experience with &lt;em&gt;Siege&lt;/em&gt;, we are excited to start with a blank page and the creative freedom to create a completely unique experience in the multiplayer space,” said Xavier Marquis, the creative director of the new studio and one of its founding members hired from Ubisoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Izdgth"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;struggled to make a name for itself&lt;/a&gt; in the game development space despite heavy investments in original titles and in-house studios. Most notably, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;pulled and then outright canceled&lt;/a&gt; its free-to-play hero shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; last year. Other struggles Amazon has faced include pulling its video game adaption of &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us?selectedCategory=knvoHwbjb7jhI9UTc7Bwc&amp;amp;selectedIssue=6mv76MwH3RghqKo988Cl14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from storefronts after releasing to poor reviews in 2019, and the delay of its other major original project, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to sometime later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAe9jX"&gt;Those failures are not yet deterring incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who expressed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265932/amazon-ceo-game-studios-andy-jassy-commitment-struggling-video-game-division"&gt;commitment&lt;/a&gt; to the company’s game development endeavors following a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;report about the division’s struggles&lt;/a&gt;. Jassy told employees in an email last month that he believes the game development division can thrive “if we hang in there.” &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VhJip8"&gt;Two dolphins were caught on video swimming through Venice canals near the iconic St. Mark’s Square yesterday. The pair, an adult and a calf, visited during heightened coronavirus-related restrictions in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir2Jdm"&gt;The sight was “a great joy in a dark period for everyone,” Luca Folin told local newspaper &lt;a href="https://nuovavenezia.gelocal.it./venezia/cronaca/2021/03/22/news/ho-filmato-i-delfini-a-venezia-per-regalare-a-tutti-un-sorriso-in-un-momento-duro-per-tutti-1.40058799?ref=fbfnv&amp;amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;La Nuova di Venezia e Mestre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The paper reports that Folin took &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VeneziaPulita/status/1373910398483718146"&gt;one video&lt;/a&gt; of the dolphins that went viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TYWoFe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/344zZGnAi_c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXhOFX"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/coronavirus-pandemic-fake-animal-viral-social-media-posts"&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt; reports of dolphins splashing through Venice canals near the start of the pandemic last year, this week’s sighting is legitimate. The dolphins were first seen close to 8AM near St. Mark’s Square. They hung around in the Giudecca Canal until 3PM, Sandro Mazzariol told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. Mazzariol is a veterinary pathologist and an associate professor at the University of Padova who helped authorities after the latest dolphin sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBvrVN"&gt;Authorities attempted to escort the dolphins back out to sea, and away from maritime traffic in the canals, using “acoustic devices,” according to Mazzariol. He worked with police and the coast guard, who assembled a small fleet of seven boats to encourage the dolphins to swim out to the open waters of the Adriatic Sea. They’re not entirely sure where the dolphins are now or if they’re still somewhere in the Venetian lagoon, Mazzariol said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vln4T7"&gt;Biologists are still studying images to figure out what kind of dolphins they are. At “first evaluation” they look like striped dolphins, Mazzariol said, which aren’t usually seen in the Northern Adriatic near Venice. Identifying the species in person was difficult, he added, because the fleet tried to keep a certain distance to avoid “stress[ing]” the dolphins. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Mitchell Clark? </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A standing desk with a tangle of cables&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tDOzAR"&gt;There are a lot of topics, both serious and fun, that are out there to be covered by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it falls on our news writers to cover them: from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/coronavirus"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/space"&gt;space exploration&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22337007/matpat-game-theory-10-year-anniversary-youtube-interview-gaming"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt;. Mitchell Clark is one of those writers; among other articles, he wrote one of the best explanations you can find of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;what exactly NFTs are&lt;/a&gt;. We took a look (remotely via photos) of Mitchell’s desk and asked him some questions about his stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYQo9n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at The Verge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhnlnH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310104/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox"&gt;Like Jay, I’m a news writer&lt;/a&gt;, tasked with keeping &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s readers up to date with news about pretty much anything you could think of. Lately, it’s been a lot of NFTs, but it’s really just a grab bag every day I come into work, which keeps it exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNhGWr"&gt;I also literally just got here — I started in December. I previously did a little of everything, from slinging fast-food chicken fingers, professionally fixing people’s phone problems, and doing training, testing, and coding for software the government uses. Basically, pretty much anything not related to my degree in video production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EF91IsdPbOTFBN5WP7q2vD4ltQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390076/mclark_210311_4470_0022.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Er8AyX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wI5mbB"&gt;I live in a relatively small and cheap city, so I’m luxuriating in a two-bedroom apartment. I’ve worked at home ever since we moved here in 2017, so as soon as we got all the moving boxes out of the second room, I claimed it as my office. As for where the desk is: it used to be up against the window, but the sun kept getting in my eyes, so I moved it against the wall instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnyXAC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nhx3iJ"&gt;It’s called the &lt;a href="https://www.imovr.com/imovr-energize-standing-desk-workstation.html"&gt;iMovR Energize&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a motorized standing desk. And yes, I do actually work standing up a lot. I don’t often work sitting at it, though — the cat is banned from the office, but if I’m in here he’ll sit outside the door and scream. So if I’m going to work sitting down, I do it on the couch so he doesn’t guilt-trip me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CVwlK"&gt;Half of the reason why I chose the Energize was because it’s ostensibly made in the US, and the other half is that there are almost no reviews of it, and I wanted to do one and have it stand out. As far as I can tell, I’m still the only person who’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiuu9C5iMYw"&gt;done a video review of it on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the TL;DR of which is that it’s a good desk. If it lasts for 10 years, it may actually be worth the almost $1,000 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="p0FWIp"&gt;
&lt;div id="vnv1dg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401527" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="U4sroo"&gt;
&lt;p id="z4sx47"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that’s the simplest desk chair I’ve seen so far.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBlWLO"&gt;Yeahhhh, it’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Ftrollberget-sit-stand-support-glose-black-60388258%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Ikea Trollberget&lt;/a&gt;. I went with it over an office chair in the optimistic hope that it would help me not slouch so much. The seat part of it tilts back and forth, so it really requires some core strength to sit up straight, which is great when I actually do that, but honestly I usually just put my elbows on the desk and curve my body into some horrible “S” shape. If I lived somewhere I could find a used Herman Miller, I’d probably give one of those a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7R21kK5RdrkxXTuoaiZ764SWj9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376751/mclark_210311_4470_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q2RyiT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about your audio setup. It looks like you’ve put considerable thought into it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji4EC7"&gt;Yes, I have. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shure Beta 87A&lt;/a&gt; microphone, mounted on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heil-Sound-PL-2T-Overhead-Broadcast/dp/B000SZVZ74?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heil PL2T arm&lt;/a&gt; and connected to a Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 audio interface. The headphones are the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FDT770pro80--beyerdynamic-dt-770-pro-80-ohm-closed-back-studio-mixing-headphones&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 ohms&lt;/a&gt;, which aren’t super fun for music (hence the fifth-gen iPod with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/KZ-ES4-Balanced-Technology-Earphones/dp/B07D57F1RK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;KZ ES4 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;) but are great for accurately reproducing vocals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpZSEa"&gt;The whole setup is optimized for one thing: making sure that my voice is as clear and echo-free as possible. I was tired of having to go into a cave of blankets to record voiceovers, so I got a microphone with a very narrow (supercardioid) pickup pattern, and it works great. I also sometimes use it as an improvised video mic, for which it’s only okay. Usually, it just makes me sound really great on Zoom calls (and lets me pretend I’m going to make more episodes of a podcast I made three episodes of and then gave up on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EgkG2Q"&gt;
&lt;div id="qpkPur"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401995" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UlnhHC"&gt;
&lt;p id="cooLyE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your other tech: your computer, display setup, and other tech stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfeGSO"&gt;Alright! My computer is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch M1 Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; — I went with the Pro over the Air mainly for the brighter screen. When I’m working from my desk and not the couch, I plonk that on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-South-Laptops-MacBooks-ergonomic/dp/B07377XVNY?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Twelve South Curve stand&lt;/a&gt;, and plug it in to a… *checks B&amp;amp;H order history* &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1090259-REG%2Fdell_u2415_24_ultrasharp_led_monitor.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell U2415 24-inch monitor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F783KC"&gt;It’s 16:10, which is nice, but unfortunately it’s got a 1920 x 1200 resolution. I seem to be especially sensitive to low resolutions (I can immediately tell the difference between YouTube at 1080p and 720p on my &lt;em&gt;iPhone Mini&lt;/em&gt;), so my next big upgrade may be to LG’s 24-inch UltraFine 4K (if I can find one used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpH7Dq"&gt;I switch between a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Trackpad-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B016QO5YWC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Trackpad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G502-Performance-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/ref=sr_1_2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt; for my mousing needs. Changing which device and hand I use helps stave off wrist pain, and I’ve discovered that any mouse without Logitech’s ratcheting / free-spinning scroll wheel is almost unusable for me. For my keyboard, I use the peculiarly named &lt;a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;amp;p=3732"&gt;Ducky One 2&lt;/a&gt; with Cherry MX Browns. The main theme is wired: I’ve always run into weird, annoying issues with Bluetooth keyboards and mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPENuQ"&gt;The final Big Thing on my desk is an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1071815-REG%2Fowc_other_world_computing_owctb2ivkit0gb_thunderbay_iv.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339963%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-mitchell-clark-macbook-shure" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OWC ThunderBay 4&lt;/a&gt;. Being into video production and photography (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-X-T3-Mirrorless-Digital-Body/dp/B07H3Y9CJY?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fujifilm X-T3&lt;/a&gt; for digital, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F3"&gt;Nikon F3HP&lt;/a&gt; for film, by the way), I accumulate a lot of absolutely&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;massive files: I’ve currently got 11TB of data spread out across 17TB of drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kWDylL"&gt;
&lt;div id="gnOXMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221788" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zJUyPX"&gt;
&lt;p id="orCBuk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned that you had a bit of a cable issue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhqQos"&gt;Yeah, I just up (down? side-to-side?)-graded from an iMac Pro, which had just enough ports to plug in my five bajillion peripherals. Now my computer has two ports, so I have an absolute nightmare of a situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGLShM"&gt;Here’s my current setup: I connect my laptop with Thunderbolt to the ThunderBay 4. Somehow that provides enough power to trickle-charge the laptop, and provides a Thunderbolt pass-through, which I currently have a USB-C &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Aluminum-Type-C-Clamp-Reader/dp/B078853NCS/ref=asc_df_B078859974/?tag=&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=309779531175&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=7357722852296212524&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9033789&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-431341047288&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;adgrpid=62412137260&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Satechi Clamp Hub Pro&lt;/a&gt; plugged into. Plugged into &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; are my mouse and keyboard, and my monitor’s built-in USB hub, which has even more devices plugged into it (notably the scanner and Scarlett). Then I use my laptop’s second Thunderbolt port to plug in the monitor (good thing the ThunderBay can charge the computer, I’m out of ports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnRcei8vz886eWNtykb-7uXUpRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390077/mclark_210311_4470_0024.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="soK6sR"&gt;I’ve got an &lt;a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-dock"&gt;OWC Thunderbolt 4 Dock&lt;/a&gt; on preorder to save me from this triple-hub chain nightmare, but until then, I’ve just got a mess of wires and am hoping nothing breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzNNez"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see your keyboard is right near your desk. Do you ever take a break to make some music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pF5Tvn"&gt;I can’t actually play piano to be honest, even though I’ve literally had this keyboard since I was seven years old. I do have it hooked up to my computer through the Scarlett’s MIDI interface, so sometimes if I find a really cool-sounding synth in Logic, I’ll mash at the keyboard until I get something that sounds good. Its main job, though, is to sit there, guilting me until I actually learn even a drop of music theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3dsen"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looks like a great setup for storing your bikes, but I’d be nervous about crashing into them if I push my chair back too hard…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYsewR"&gt;I’d never even thought about that, but thankfully my chair doesn’t have wheels so I’d really have to try for it. The biggest risk with the bikes is that I’ll look out my window, see the paved trail that runs right outside it (and keeps going for 100 miles into a different state), and not be able to resist the temptation to take a ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFLCvy"&gt;For any other apartment-dwellers, the bike stand is probably a great option: it’s made by a company called Delta Design. I bought mine at Costco, but as always when I find something I like there, it’s no longer available. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delta-Cycle-Home-Michelangelo/dp/B08PL2K4RG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon still sells it&lt;/a&gt;, and REI &lt;a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;amp;website_id=0f9b0f6f-13ac-4498-8e0f-b3beae765e07&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F884870%2Fdelta-cycle-michelangelo-rugged-2-bike-gravity-rack&amp;amp;ctc=VergeWOYDMitchellClark03222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has a nicer-looking version&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RI7KZi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about your decorations: the great collection you’ve got on your bulletin board, the sculptures on your windowsill, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADQcPi"&gt;I always want to have things that, as Marie Kondo would put it, spark joy around me while I’m working. So, I try to decorate with things made by creators or friends, or with art that is associated with some sort of memory. Some of the pins are from webcomics or podcasts that I enjoy, some are from Etsy, and the vintage and Michigan-related ones I got from my grandma, who apparently collected them. I’m on the record as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1352770201314447360?s=20"&gt;absolutely loving &lt;em&gt;Kentucky Route Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I figured I’d get a poster of it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6orj"&gt;The coolest story, though, goes with the metal bonsai trees. I did karate for about 10 years (and have missed doing it for six), and my sensei had a friend who would make the trees by hand. He’d give them out every year as awards for people who exemplified certain qualities of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dj%C5%8D_kun#Interpretations"&gt;Shotokan dojo kun&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t remember which I got them for, but they’re good reminders of some pretty good rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LJDWf9tINegala4OHe-NwqaL-Y4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376761/mclark_210311_4470_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RU0tInTcpSsVo4dKKvO_yCKLyZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376754/mclark_210311_4470_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCKjdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s on the shelving beneath the bulletin board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fA13a5"&gt;A little bit of everything! There’s an Epson Perfection V550 scanner, which I use for everything from the mundane (scanning documents and birthday / holiday cards) to the exciting only to me (scanning all the film negatives I’ve developed). I also keep all my camera gear there, with one of the drawers having a mishmash of GoPro accessories, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Lightweight-Microphone-Integrated-Shockmount/dp/B00GQDORA4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rode VideoMic Go&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-H5-Four-Track-Portable-Recorder/dp/B00KCXMBES?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom H5&lt;/a&gt;, and other video gear. The other drawer has “ancient media” like VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and vinyl records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ist68X"&gt;Oh, and there’s a label maker, which I’m pretty sure doesn’t have any tape left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrnTU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally — do you often hide under your desk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUUqaE"&gt;Only in the summer, when it’s hot and I need to get out of the sunlight! But I do work from the floor a lot, either just sitting on it or laying down. I’ve been told it’s weird (usually by my wife, who comes home and finds me laying on the floor, with the cat having sprawled himself across my legs), but it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob6Ibn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
