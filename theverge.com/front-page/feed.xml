    <title>A professor straight up dies in the new Pokémon Legends: Arceus trailer </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yj_T95opNSAgjNUZnaNvWmCMthg=/104x0:1151x698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026855/FCO7qGWXoAEOJsO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqGZl4"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; Company released a new teaser trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698264/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s causing a bit of concern. The 2-minute video features found footage of an unknown professor’s trek through a snowy wilderness as he attempts to document pokémon using a strange device he’s found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckORIN"&gt;The professor — who will probably become the fandom’s newest zaddy because he sounds really cute — can’t contain his excitement as he stumbles on a sneeze of snorunts. But because of this man’s gleeful disregard for his own safety approaching dangerous (but oh so cute) animals in their natural habitats, it’s easy to see what happens next. The professor makes his way deep into a forest where he spots what he thinks is a zorua and zoroark. Suddenly, he’s struck by a shadow and goes silent, with the camera falling to the ground at an odd angle. The pokémon he was spying come into focus, revealing Hisuian versions of zorua and zoroark. The zorua looks concerned and sniffs at the camera for a moment before slinking away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4wx70"&gt;In the language of found footage movies, this guy is dead. Fans on social media registered shock and concern about the professor’s assumed fate, but obviously not before gushing over how cute Hisuian Zorua is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xcoCaK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NOOOOO THE ZORUA IS SO CUTEEEE WHEN IT RUNS UP TO THE CAMERA rip that dude tho &lt;a href="https://t.co/A57GFDLPvs"&gt;https://t.co/A57GFDLPvs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nate   (@chimeraboyz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chimeraboyz/status/1451178230459797508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wAo5A"&gt;Professor Zaddy’s alleged death on camera is both shocking and not really shocking if you think about it. On the one hand, The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; Company has crafted a very family-friendly image for its 25-year-old, billion-dollar, planet-spanning, cultural phenomena. On the other hand, this is a franchise built on the premise of what is essentially fantastical cockfighting. And if you read the Pokédex entries of any number of mon, like &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hatterene_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Pok.C3.A9dex_entries"&gt;hatterne&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mimikyu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Pok.C3.A9dex_entries_2"&gt;mimikyu&lt;/a&gt;, for example, things&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;get &lt;em&gt;dark&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; universe. So a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game trailer that mercs a professor for the crime of being overly enthusiastic about pokémon isn’t really tonally far off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHm1W9"&gt;A much tamer interpretation is that the shadow spirited the professor back in time to the Hisui region where the game is set, which would be a neat explanation as to why this &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game takes place in ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWVv7z"&gt;We’ll find out for sure when &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; hits the Nintendo Switch on January 28th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island are filing for a federal union election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5IWYg7mo8m9vYmzNAa7UQA0ixtA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026830/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon workers may get a chance to vote to form a union | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvDGUV"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s warehouses in Staten Island, New York are preparing to file for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board on October 25th, after getting signatures on union authorization cards from more than 2,000 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cqs2Vr"&gt;The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) is an independent group of employees that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;trying to organize workers&lt;/a&gt; at four Amazon warehouses in Staten Island. It’s led by former Amazon worker Christian Smalls, who was fired in March after he helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;organize a walkout&lt;/a&gt; at the company’s JFK8 warehouse to protest unsafe working conditions during the pandemic. Amazon has said Smalls was fired for violating safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQBNGb"&gt;“This is truly a remarkable historical moment for all Amazon workers all over the country,” the ALU said in a statement Thursday. “We’re not getting complacent, and we now need the support of the communities more than ever as our fight is just getting started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZFcI"&gt;If the union’s petition is granted approval by the NLRB, it would mean the second-ever unionization vote at an Amazon warehouse this year. In April, a union drive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; failed dramatically when workers voted against unionization by a margin of more than two-to-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFkbWo"&gt;The organizing union later contested the validity of the election, citing concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;a USPS mailbox installed in the Bessemer fulfillment center parking lot during the drive&lt;/a&gt;. An assessment by the NLRB in August recommended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;a new election for Bessemer&lt;/a&gt; warehouse workers, saying the installation of the mailbox had likely violated US labor law, although an official ruling has yet to be issued by the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lcknwE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Unionizing Amazon warehouses was never going to be easy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q1KVrA"&gt;Still, the ALU is confident the Staten Island drive will be more successful. “Since the campaign has launched, Amazon has not wasted any time union busting,” the ALU said in its statement Thursday. “We have endured the same strategies used in Bessemer, Alabama, from signs in the bathrooms and breaks, to the same union-busting firms and consultants being brought in to walk around the workplace and divide the workers. Regardless of Amazon anti-union attempts, ALU has earned the trust of the workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ibwMl"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its workers have always had the choice of whether to join a union, but that the company doesn’t think unions are the best answer for its employees. Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21502639/amazon-union-busting-tracking-memo-spoc"&gt;devoted significant resources&lt;/a&gt; to fight against workers organizing; in just the past few months, the NLRB has found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;Amazon threatened&lt;/a&gt; and, in some cases, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-nlrb/u-s-labor-board-claims-amazon-illegally-fired-warehouse-worker-idUSKBN28R319"&gt;fired workers&lt;/a&gt; who had &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;protested its handling&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 cases at warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8sAuE"&gt;“Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes—quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle,“ Nantel said. “The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated—these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few.” Nantel added that the company had made “great progress in recent years and months in important areas like pay and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjvMnj"&gt;At the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year, workers at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;Amazon warehouses across the country&lt;/a&gt; raised safety concerns, saying the company didn’t notify them when workers tested positive for the virus. As part of the drive, the Amazon Labor Union is demanding higher wages, safer working conditions, more paid time off options, and longer break periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmthzo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6QxnT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqH4CY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WkpJc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump’s new social media SPAC, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump talks on a phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_P7ddo8n7KihQWb-nlP3SxruWoY=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026800/34252546901_796261c8af_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/34252546901/" target="_blank"&gt;Shealah Craighead / The White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wnfx2i"&gt;In his latest attempt to return to the social media spotlight, Donald Trump is now turning to a current darling of the startup world: the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrqOe6"&gt;Trump &lt;a href="https://tmtgcorp.com/press-releases/announcement-10-20-2021"&gt;announced Wednesday night&lt;/a&gt; that he has a new company called Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group (TMTG) and that he would be merging this new company with a SPAC called Digital World Acquisition Company (DWAC). If completed, the deal would turn Trump’s new media company into one that’s publicly traded on the Nasdaq. And it would give TMTG enough money to get a new Twitter clone off the ground called “Truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDWb7Z"&gt;The surprise deal is already turning DWAC into a meme stock, and it raises a fair number of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lfgdzO"&gt;Wait, what’s a SPAC?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kGKJhf"&gt;Briefly, SPACs are shell companies that get listed on exchanges like the Nasdaq and exist for the sole purpose of eventually merging with companies that want to go public. Someone, often from the finance world, starts the company and gets a few other people to throw money in the pot in exchange for shares of the shell — typically sold at $10 a pop. They set themselves a deadline (usually around two years) by which they aim to find a company to merge with and tell the market which industry they’re targeting — though they can really merge with any willing business. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;far more detailed explainer if you’re curious&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="islhcB"&gt;Trump has a new company?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nfwyYE"&gt;Apparently! It was registered in Delaware in February but somehow went unnoticed until Wednesday night. Anyway, Trump has &lt;em&gt;very big &lt;/em&gt;ambitions for TMTG, according to the truly ludicrous 22-page &lt;a href="https://tmtgcorp.com/company-overview/"&gt;investor presentation&lt;/a&gt; that was published on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQw9ODi8-5xfKcCFdY0sUWWvGgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945054/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_11.53.11_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TMTG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Seriously, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://tmtgcorp.com/company-overview/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;presentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; must be seen to be believed.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NAn8mx"&gt;TMTG’s ambitions don’t end with Truth Social, Trump’s Twitter clone. Ultimately, TMTG aims to be a conglomerate with plans to — in all seriousness — operate a news network that competes with CNN, a streaming platform that competes with Disney+, and a technology services business that competes with Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X1JclN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group starts with a Twitter clone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WN0Qfl"&gt;So far, the only part of this that exists are bits of Truth Social, which appears to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Techmeme/status/1451211912218218497"&gt;a fork of decentralized social network&lt;/a&gt; Mastodon. The app already has issues. Some journalists have already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikaelthalen/status/1451017501026885632?s=21"&gt;created accounts&lt;/a&gt; on the app with usernames like “donaldtrump” and “mikepence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNPlsn"&gt;The promotional materials for Truth are full of fake messages from brands that didn’t give TMTG permission to be used. In one image, a “@ChevyTrucks” account has posted messages about a 2022 model year Chevy Tahoe; Chevy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “unaware of this project.” “There is no 2022 Chevy Tahoe EV,” a General Motors spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7lw9w"&gt;Other messages include headlines from news outlets like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Variety. TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief, Matthew Panzarino, says he didn’t approve the headline. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; didn’t respond to a request for comment. &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have an on-the-record comment. If none of these brands were involved, it’s probably a safe bet that they aren’t getting back to us because they’re busy calling their lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="i4JHh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I've approved some clunkers. Just not this one.&lt;/p&gt;— Panzer (@panzer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1450992645031956480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vz2tSc"&gt;Meanwhile, the Terms of Service for Truth Social include &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1450997391142817792?s=21"&gt;a rule that prohibits users from disparaging Truth&lt;/a&gt; on the platform — despite TMTG promoting Truth as a “big tent” where “all are welcome.” You are also not allowed to write posts with too many capital letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="7eMBmG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The TMTG investor presentation has no details about money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5rmLV"&gt;The investor presentation is also notable for what it’s missing: details on &lt;em&gt;the money&lt;/em&gt;. Usually, these things at &lt;em&gt;least &lt;/em&gt;glance at what kind of money the company seeking a merger has and what it projects future revenue might be. Usually, this is part of the motivation for SPACing in the first place: IPOs don’t let you project future revenue in quite the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSrG0g"&gt;TMTG’s presentation doesn’t say a word about revenue, past or future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d0Z4X1"&gt;Haven’t there been a bunch of right-wing Twitter clones?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SQPlDt"&gt;There have! Gettr and Parler were both founded in the wake of the Trump bans, with older networks like Rumble seeing significant growth too. All three benefit from a new sense among conservatives that moderation on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are biased against them. In theory, that should create a huge potential audience for conservative-friendly alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxHDX5"&gt;In practice, the idea has run into a lot of problems that are likely to repeat themselves in Trump’s “Truth” project. The biggest challenge for any social network is scale: if there’s no one posting, then there’s nothing to read, which means fewer readers and less incentive to post. Outside splashy launches, most conservative-focused networks have struggled to maintain that scale — particularly Parler, where user growth &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/06/02/parlers-popularity-plummets-as-data-reveals-little-appetite-for-returning-free-speech-app-favored-by-conservatives/?sh=69fc5b9d5e13"&gt;slowed to a trickle&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. Right-wing platforms also struggled to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383841/mike-lindell-social-network-frank-free-speech-conservative-censorship"&gt;set basic policies&lt;/a&gt; around hate speech and violent threats, caught between “free speech” branding and a lingering resistance to the nihilist chaos of spaces like 4chan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V2qDrx"&gt;But didn’t this specific thing already happen? I remember hearing Trump launched a social network.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5OMiyW"&gt;He said that he was going to, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook"&gt;when it finally launched&lt;/a&gt;, it was just a blog for his press releases. We’re assuming this won’t just be another blog, but at this point, who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7EClB"&gt;Who runs the company Trump wants to merge with?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lyz7L8"&gt;In the broadest sense, a bunch of money guys. It was started by a man named Peter Orlando, who has been an investment banker and ran a sugar trading company. The SPAC’s chief financial officer is Luis Orleans-Braganza&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;a serial entrepreneur who is also a&lt;em&gt; current member &lt;/em&gt;of Brazil’s National Congress in Jair Boslonaro’s party and the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-06/royalists-pine-for-days-of-empire-in-bolsonaros-brazil"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e135da74-179a-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e"&gt;heir to Brazil’s defunct throne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NI335j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The SPAC is run by a prince, an investment banker, and a “disruptive technology investing enthusiast”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3bu3L"&gt;Orlando is involved in a few other SPACs, though he has yet to find a merger partner for any of them. Most recently, he has been trying to merge one with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/hydrogen-fuel-firm-ecombustible-eyes-up-to-1-billion-spac-deal"&gt;a hydrogen fuel company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1GUwS"&gt;The existing directors (or nominees to be directors) who already own shares of the Digital World Acquisition Company SPAC have... let’s say, &lt;em&gt;eclectic&lt;/em&gt; backgrounds. Lee Jacobson was an executive at Midway Games and Atari and also ran a mobile games analytics company that went bankrupt in 2019. Bruce Garelick is a hedge fund guy who describes himself as a “disruptive technology investing enthusiast” in DWAC’s SEC filings; he went to Wharton — Trump’s alma mater. Justin Shaner is a real estate investor and developer. Brian Shevland is a portfolio manager who also went to Wharton. Eric Swider has a history working in the resorts business. Rodrigo Veloso created a bottled water company that actually succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBpUZf"&gt;But it’s hard to say if they will stick around if a merger gets done. One of the problems with SPACs is that people who help create them are financially incentivized to walk away after the merger. The &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-16/hedge-funds-are-demanding-their-spac-money-back-too-fast"&gt;money is just too good&lt;/a&gt; for those who leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tFAXV3"&gt;What is a PIPE, and why does it matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lG7DEz"&gt;I apologize for another acronym. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwIpR3"&gt;SPAC mergers often involve a parallel funding round known as the “public investment in private equity,” or PIPE. This means that a company that’s merging gets the SPAC money &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; some&lt;em&gt; more&lt;/em&gt; money from outside investors. In return for that money, the outside investors get a chunk of the new company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4W0kf8"&gt;The outside investors are usually institutions like banks and pension funds. These investors often add legitimacy — even prestige — by having kicked the tires on the company. That can make other investors more comfortable with the SPAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OrL6N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Again — show me the money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mTbwRN"&gt;Trump’s merger plan makes no mention of a PIPE. This is honestly very funny! Remember how we talked earlier about Trump’s ambitions to take on Disney, Amazon, and CNN? Okay. So the pile of money that he’s getting from the SPAC is about $300 million. That’s &lt;em&gt;adorable.&lt;/em&gt; Netflix will spend&lt;em&gt; $17 billion &lt;/em&gt;on content alone in fiscal 2021, and they don’t have to build a platform from scratch, which would be a significant expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WQ2sjq"&gt;Why would Trump do this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ED1S7M"&gt;Because he misses being on Twitter. If he is going to run for president again in 2024, he’ll need a social platform that isn’t just a shitty blog. And while right-wing social networks have failed as platforms, they’ve succeeded as a way of getting attention and dressing up general public indifference as a form of ominous censorship. Whatever happens with this new project, it will give Trump a great excuse to complain about Facebook at rallies. Maybe that’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lh1fbP"&gt;I have to also imagine that there’s an element of financial gamesmanship here. Trump has exploited tax loopholes for decades. He’s pushed banks to grant him risky loans, and when those loans went bad, he’d go to extreme lengths to put them off — like when he sued Deutsche Bank and claimed he shouldn’t pay them back &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/business/05norris.html"&gt;because they helped cause the Great Recession&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="egr2ZX"&gt;So, um, why would this work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kSEqKK"&gt;Well, remember meme stocks? Donald Trump had a whole meme presidency. Given the strength of his online fanbase and the general proliferation of “we like the stock” investing, it seems possible the plan is just to launch the company and have his true believers buy in. SPACs have been, at times, popular targets for the new class of casual retail traders. It’s not hard to imagine many people buying stock in this company simply for the lulz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E7RVHM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s already a meme stock, even if it’s not meant to be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0YZSmE"&gt;In fact, this may already be working! At the time this story was published, shares of the DWAC SPAC are already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SPACtrack/status/1451220906983006213"&gt;approaching the record for number of shares traded in one day&lt;/a&gt;. That extreme volatility has only lifted the stock price to $25, though, meaning we’re not seeing the same kind of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;coordination that propped up the valuation of, say, GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z31x6W"&gt;But there’s risk here, too. If those existing SPAC shareholders leave — as they are kind of financially incentivized to do — then regular people buying the stock could wind up owning shares of a company that’s less valuable than promised. CNBC recently determined that &lt;em&gt;97 percent &lt;/em&gt;of SPACs that have not yet completed a merger are&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/higher-quality-spac-sponsors-must-emerge-for-once-red-hot-space-to-turn-around.html"&gt; trading below their initial $10 share price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvSBBD"&gt;Of course, if this deal doesn’t work out, it wouldn’t be the first time that Trump has left other people — including his supporters — holding the bag.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google shares its commitment to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwgmA6pFjrbcPQk9-l7l93inf0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026722/dseifert_20210323_4485_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Nest Hub 2nd Gen has a Thread radio built-in that will be updated in 2022 to enable Matter support.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="In8SuQ"&gt;Google gave a glimpse into how the new smart home standard Matter might actually work in our smart homes today, and it’s looking pretty exciting. At its &lt;a href="https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/smarthomesummit2021?utm_campaign=Q3_2021_SHS"&gt;Google Smart Home Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced new tools to help developers build devices that work with both Google Home, the new connectivity standard Matter, and across any other Matter-complaint ecosystems. This means that, yes — one day, very soon — the (new) Nest Thermostat could work in the Apple Home app without the need for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678088/home-assistant-amber-smart-home-hub-specs-release-date-price"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; or other workarounds. And if those two can work together, well, anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0fn3"&gt;Due to arrive next year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is an open smart home application protocol that promises to make smart home devices talk to each other no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made them. It wants to take the hard work out of choosing, setting up, and integrating devices with your smart home and voice assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDjQVs"&gt;“Matter is a very big initiative for us,” Kevin Po, Senior Product Manager at Google, told me in a briefing ahead of today’s announcements. “It will really solve that interoperability choice, that frustrating purchasing and setup experience for the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/650T2DjqJkUchNh9tZwvw1SEkkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944994/Fg39T_wZn6cXSyiUsE5VWFJcZYp0HgK4Etnqn9wpNloMdq0RMXnAJdYaXtPwMsaRT_OtxaQHJxKLgjjmZrZmZwRbcSM2WSQ1UEZCxIGaSJg5BVD9crA7hFPauYbso0cLOd6xGLMpiVlCAmR63VS7ihfU8L6kPfruCDqytEUqzeb_uH0J_s1600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Smart Home Summit, Google shared images of how device set-up may work with Matter-enabled devices across different apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6fURmm"&gt;At the event, the company doubled down on its commitment to supporting Matter and its main supporting protocol, Thread (a low-powered mesh network), across its entire ecosystem. It also revealed a new name for its smart home efforts: Google Home. While consumers have been familiar with that moniker for a while, on the backend, developers have dealt with a myriad of different services they needed to understand and pick through to figure out how to make their device work with Google Assistant and Google Nest devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khp3sH"&gt;The new Google Home brings development for device setup, automation capabilities, voice control, and Android and Google Nest devices under one umbrella. The new name is “for our entire smart home platform and developer program,” said Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, during the event’s keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8gm7n"&gt;A new Google Home Developer Center was also announced. A one-stop shop for developing anything smart home-related, the Developer Center introduces some new tools to help accelerate the adoption of Matter in the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5M5PU"&gt;A Google Home Device SDK for Matter can help developers quickly build and integrate Matter devices so they’ll be ready when the standard launches next year. This is also when Google has committed to updating its Nest and Android devices with Matter support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhxXnI"&gt;Native Android Support via Google Play Services and a new Google Home Mobile SDK will bring Matter support to mobile devices and apps to help streamline smart home device set up. This should mean setting up a Matter-enabled device — such as a light bulb or smart plug — will be as simple as powering it up and opening an app (either Google Home or the manufacturer’s app). The app will then do most of the heavy lifting of connecting to Wi-Fi and Thread, and any other Matter devices you have. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6zBWq90eJZkpNmfa-brqk1XLH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944944/9pc16xHlCuF_UeXbhcH2Ln92s8R4glbH6h3f8Fd5MyWI10AQ7ZgpYkWxETyplgBS8GHsFG62THDGT4k5A9SCfTTonAAa3cYA3Bdq52B_7YNZw1Npd_25TId9cfU0COkTIY_K2_Y_kOeIwMzTNK1OhG_bevn22F7ty_cQ5rSpK5LYyl3Z_s1600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Home Developer Center launches next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CC0SOm"&gt;There are a lot of questions still around Matter — but from what Google revealed today, it seems that while a unified setup experience is coming, a unified app is not on the cards. There won’t be a Matter-branded app that you can put all your devices into — instead, you can choose to use one or more apps from a Matter-enabled ecosystem to control your home with. This is similar to how HomeKit-enabled devices work with Apple’s smart home now — you can use Apple’s Home app or a third-party app to control them. Each app will likely offer different features and controls based on how the manufacturers look to differentiate themselves, so you can choose which suits your needs best. Whether you have to install the manufacturer’s app for firmware updates or other reasons is not clear yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1z0P7"&gt;The most important thing for smart home users is that all Matter-enabled devices will work with all apps that support Matter. So, if Apple opens up its Home app to Matter (and it is on the board of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;CSA&lt;/a&gt;, which oversees the initiative), and Google turns on Matter support in its Nest Thermostat — you will be able to control it in the Apple Home app. “If they are compliant from a Matter of perspective, there’s no reason why that can’t be possible,” confirmed Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtTdgQ"&gt;In other Google Home news, the company announced the introduction of Suggested Routines in the Google Home app. This should go some way to bringing back more of the functionality third-party device makers lost when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18627719/google-works-with-nest-shutdown-clarification-statement-update"&gt;Works With Nest program shut down &lt;/a&gt;(some of which returned with the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9251759?hl=en"&gt;Home / Away presence sensing option&lt;/a&gt; introduced at this event last year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkncNc"&gt;Suggested Routines will let manufacturers build their own Routines (which enable your devices to automatically activate) in the Google Home app to interact with both Nest devices and any other third-party devices you have linked to the app. They’ll be able to use what Google calls “context signals” — voice, time, and device/sensor state — to trigger the Routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgJZi9"&gt;Google is sharing details on its announcements from the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on its &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/home"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the new tools are available in preview now and rolling out next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google details extensive phishing campaign targeting YouTubers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_ybhS7hjiPTg9VkpneHNsDoli4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026711/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POLvc0"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing a phishing campaign directed at YouTubers, which involved around 15,000 fake accounts and over a million messages to targets. The phishing attempts were carried out by multiple hackers, and the company says it’s recovered around 4,000 accounts since late 2019. The attackers weren’t just trying to get the creators to put their password into a fake website, though — they were trying to infect their computer with malware that would steal their login cookies, which is a much more intensive attack than sending a link and waiting for someone to get sloppy with their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haAyEl"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicly say who was recruiting the hackers, only that they were using Russian-language forums to advertise. The campaign’s focus on YouTube accounts, instead of traditional targets like government computer systems or banks, shows how valuable gaining access to influencers’ social accounts and audiences’ attention can be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTDAyM-xnoQRQga7LWTBHZYMsqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944886/table_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the advertisements posted to forums trying to recruit hackers to phish YouTubers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQldVK"&gt;The hack generally worked like this: hackers reached out to the YouTubers, pretending to offer ad deals promoting a VPN, antivirus program, or other software on their channel. If the creator agreed, they got a link that, if clicked, would infect their computer using a variety of malware programs, usually designed to steal cookies and passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJGy4A"&gt;Because of the prevalence of two-factor authentication (whether through prompts, codes, or hardware keys), the cookies may have been an especially valuable target — hackers were looking at the ones that websites use to store a user’s log-in session (these files are the reason you don’t have to re-enter your password every time you visit a site). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc49by"&gt;If the hackers got the YouTuber’s cookie (and were able to use it before it expired) they may have been able to take over the channel, and potentially even change passwords to lock the rightful owners out. Of course, since YouTube accounts are tied to Google accounts, these kinds of attacks also gave hackers access to Gmail, Google Drive, Photos, and other services that were tied to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aJ5Dyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hackers were either able to sell the hacked accounts or run Bitcoin scams on them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NazuGe"&gt;According to Google, after all that work, hackers were able to sell the accounts for anywhere from $3 to $4,000. While that feels relatively cheap to get a YouTube account with a good number of subscribers, the numbers may be so low because the hackers wanted to hang on to accounts that they thought could really pull in money — last year, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jxm8/hackers-hijacked-popular-youtube-channels-bitcoin-scams"&gt;tech leaker Jon Prosser told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that hackers were able to make $10,000 by livestreaming a scam on his channel, promising to double any Bitcoins viewers sent in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6Om6z"&gt;This campaign, and ones like it, could be a motivating factor in why Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-sign-safer-and-more-convenient/"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube creators would be required to turn on two-step verification (which makes having both a password and something like a phone or security key a requirement for logging in), and why it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710421/google-security-2fa-inactive-account-management"&gt;giving away thousands of security keys&lt;/a&gt; to “high risk users” on an annual basis. They don’t stop hackers who’ve taken over your computer, but making the attacks more expensive might help slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxOrRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like the giveaway scam comments, we’ll all probably have to live with phishing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgl9Cy"&gt;Google’s also been fighting the hackers in other ways, blocking their emails and files, as well as warning users when they’re visiting a malicious website in Chrome. But given the value that creators’ accounts have, criminals probably won’t be dissuaded from trying to get them — like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1448336081695412224?s=20"&gt;scam comments that show up all across YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ever-evolving phishing attacks will likely be a part of life online for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and Xbox Game Pass on December 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oP_p487HW5Tm7nzfYP9UXAW_d0I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026536/Among_Us_Hero_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsivCO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is arriving on Xbox and PlayStation on December 14th. The popular social deduction game will &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/among-us-launching-with-xbox-game-pass-on-december-14/"&gt;also launch on Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; on the same day and be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series S / X, PS4, and PS5 consoles. The announcement comes months after Sony confirmed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;coming to its PlayStation consoles&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWaCuk"&gt;Just like on other platforms, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; will support crossplay and online multiplayer across mobile, PC, and now consoles. The only difference between the two console versions is PlayStation players will get access to exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank-&lt;/em&gt;themed cosmetics. There’s a skin and hat to make your character look like Ratchet, and a pet that looks like Clank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKlpAs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was a huge hit during the early stages of the pandemic, becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;2020’s most-downloaded mobile game&lt;/a&gt;. Innersloth has been gradually improving the game over the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22526162/among-us-innersloth-new-modes-map-hide-and-seek-summer-game-fest-2021"&gt;revealing plans to add&lt;/a&gt; a hide and seek mode, visor cosmetics, and a fifth map earlier this year. Physical editions of the game are &lt;a href="https://www.innersloth.com/xbox-playstation-launch-on-dec-14/?utm_source=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=tweet&amp;amp;utm_campaign=console"&gt;also arriving in Europe&lt;/a&gt; on December 14th, with a US release due in January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regulators demand more info about tech payment systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A closeup photograph of an Indian man in a blue business suit, his collar just barely visible." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nbuFJSPfh4dFr0Y16Bx3iLapxDU=/0x0:4951x3301/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026521/1176565198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CFBP Director Rohit Chopra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mx18fp"&gt;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has issued a series of information-gathering orders on the business practices of major digital payments systems. Orders were issued to Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, PayPal, and Square, the bureau said in an announcement on Thursday morning. Chinese pay systems operated by WeChat and AliPay will also be studied but are not subject to any CFBP orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofUkWp"&gt;Issued as part of the CFPB’s investigative authority, the orders are not an indication of specific wrongdoing, but they suggest the CFPB will be taking a more active role in regulating tech companies’ consumer products in the future. In particular, they are meant to root out any data collection or anti-competitive conduct that may have not yet come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1J1or"&gt;The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ce2B1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Will the payment platforms be truly neutral?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c89uVx"&gt;In a statement, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra framed the orders as an effort to ensure tech companies were not using the power of payment processing to exploit consumers or gain an anti-competitive advantage over smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBI2sR"&gt;“Little is known publicly about how Big Tech companies will exploit their payments platforms,” Chopra said in a statement announcing the queries. “For example, will the operators engage in invasive financial surveillance and combine the data they collect on consumers with their geolocation and browsing data?... Will the payment platforms be truly neutral, or will they use their scale to extract rents from market participants?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMPpDf"&gt;Previously an FTC commissioner, Chopra worked closely with current FTC Chair Lina Khan, and the new investigation is meant to harmonize with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690176/ftc-chair-lina-khan-focus-antitrust-consumer-amazon"&gt;the FTC’s ongoing tech antitrust efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwtBNl"&gt;The orders are already drawing applause from antitrust advocates, including the American Economic Liberties project. “The CFPB’s orders will force Big Tech to come clean on their surveillance, data collection, and payments systems,” the group said in a statement, “and provide regulators another important window in their sprawling empires.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will make it easier to separate your work and personal life on Android </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQOaz-2RhlEiAcYAhYOncCmPSjg=/78x0:1362x856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026346/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_2.25.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vWQON"&gt;Google’s Work Profile tool for Android, which lets you hide your work apps and data with the flip of a switch and keeps your personal phone use safe from your company, will be coming to more users next year. According to a blog post from the company, currently, the feature is limited to phones that your organization manages, but Google says it’ll start to become available to people using Google Workspace in 2022. After that, it’ll branch out with the ultimate goal of letting anyone using Android for work flip a switch to make their business apps disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfnme"&gt;The ability to turn off work, especially when many of us are working remotely, is sorely needed. My colleague Monica Chin recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671697/personal-laptop-work-security-privacy"&gt;wrote a great argument&lt;/a&gt; for why you should have a personal laptop and a work laptop that you can close at the end of the day (and that doesn’t expose your business to your company). It’s nice to see Google making its software equivalent of that available to more people because while having two phones really cements the work / life walls, it’s just not practical for most (and could honestly be a bit of a headache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ECdmo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqwoXmaxs3M?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=69&amp;amp;start=69" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GbXXIX"&gt;Google also says that it’s working with identity and single sign-on providers Ping, Okta (choice of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s IT department), and Forgerock to improve security when users access their company’s content. The company wants to have users authenticate in its Custom Tabs system, rather than a WebView, making &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/"&gt;the experience faster for employees&lt;/a&gt; and allowing providers like Okta to access more of the phone’s security information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nzgoQ"&gt;Google’s focus on security, which includes pushing the Android Management API that comes with &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/requirements/"&gt;Android’s recommended requirements&lt;/a&gt; set by default and lets enterprises get new features quickly, isn’t just talk, either. It’s also launched a bug bounty specifically for Android Enterprise, which will pay up to $250,000 if you’re able to find a major vulnerability on Pixel devices running Google’s business-focused software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evaIbS"&gt;The focus on security, combined with the other improvements we’ve covered, makes it seem like Google’s focusing on making Android more suitable for the future where many of us work remotely — an especially relevant focus for the company, which is planning on (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt;) implementing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;a hybrid work system for its own employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google lowers Play Store fees for subscriptions and music streaming apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eHIgJEzxbCPY3isq0hfR3ZY7Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026351/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sGWkFg"&gt;As regulatory pressure on the Play Store for Android increases, Google is once again making changes to its business structure. It has announced that more categories of apps will be eligible to pay significantly less than the usual 30 percent fee. The company is announcing that all subscription-based apps will now pay a fee of 15 percent. It’s also says that “ebooks and on-demand music streaming services” will be “eligible” for a fee “as low as 10%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6rhMj"&gt;Google’s stated reason for the cheaper prices on ebooks and music streaming apps is that “content costs account for the majority of sales” and that the rates “recognize industry economics of media content verticals.” It’s unstated but also surely true that regulatory pressure and public pressure from companies like Spotify have factored in to Google’s decision. Currently, signing up for a Spotify subscription on Android redirects you to Spotify’s website to enter your payment information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbMLST"&gt;The lower fee structure for music streaming is still at Google’s discretion, both for which apps are eligible and how low that fee will be. When asked how exactly developers can know if they qualify for the reduced fees, a Google spokesperson said, “Developers can review program guidelines and express interest now and we’ll follow up with more information if they are eligible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re4Ccw"&gt;As for subscriptions, Google’s previous structure was similar to Apple’s: 30 percent the first year, 15 percent thereafter. The new change simplifies that by offering 15 percent right off the bat and is likely a strong incentive for developers to switch over from one-time payments to subscriptions. Google says that one reason for the change is that “we’ve heard that customer churn makes it challenging for subscription businesses to benefit from that reduced rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEvhp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is feeling the regulatory heat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Osen9"&gt;Google already has a program wherein the first million dollars a developer earns through Google require a 15 percent cut, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;instituted in March 2021&lt;/a&gt;. And since so many apps are ad-based and therefore free, the company claims that 99 percent of developers “qualify for a service fee of 15% or less.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlI13M"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;South Korea recently ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Google must allow third party payments in its Google Play ecosystem and Google has said that it would comply. In an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Sundar Pichai spoke to the importance of Google Play revenue to the overall Android business model for Google (emphasis ours below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NPH6Eb"&gt;We don’t take a share of the device sales, not a share of the carrier revenues. So in some way we have to sustain our ecosystem. We have a different model. Google Play is an important way. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, it’s the main source of revenue&lt;/strong&gt;. It supports Android as a whole. I think we’ll make that viewpoint clear, but we’ll engage in conversations. I’ll leave it to the team to figure out the right next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBiUXV"&gt;One big source of revenue is in-app payments for games. On that front, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google is in a legal battle with Epic Games over &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is not available in the Google Play store (but can be side-loaded through a relatively onerous process). Google is also facing a lawsuit filed by a coalition of 36 state attorneys general over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;antitrust concerns with the Google Play store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAXwR7"&gt;Add it all up and it’s obvious that Google is doing what it can to set up release valves for all that pressure by reducing store fees where it feels it can. Google lined up positive quotes from both Bumble and Duolingo in support of its lower subscription fees, a message surely aimed at regulators. And the company is likely to continue to bring out developers who aren’t angry at the Play Store business model at its &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit"&gt;developer summit next week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxgBDa"&gt;We asked Google to comment if these changes were in response to regulatory pressure, and a spokesperson replied, “Google has a long history of evolving Android and Play’s model based on feedback from our developer ecosystem on what they need to be successful on Play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxAYiz"&gt;Still, it isn’t going to bring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back to the Play Store (since it won’t qualify) and it’s far from clear that the lower fees are going to appease regulators anywhere. The pressure on Google and Apple to lower their app store fees is already having an effect. Despite these changes, it still seems that the pressure will lead to actual legal action — either via the courts or Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bought a messaging app to help make DMs and Communities better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxBNWeejnJIBBxJQpW4WgRw9Au4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026299/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Ssgqa"&gt;In an effort to strengthen its Communities, Twitter has acquired Sphere, a group chat app founded in 2016 that aims to make conversations more interactive and organized. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but &lt;a href="https://www.sphere.me/"&gt;Sphere’s website&lt;/a&gt; describes the app as a place that “transforms groups into vibrant communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XsP8Y"&gt;Sphere was co-founded in 2016 by &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-daloisio"&gt;Nick D’Aloisio, a British computer programmer turned serial entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, it was an app for real-time questions and answers but later evolved into a hub for group chats (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/twitter-buys-nick-daloisios-free-chat-app-sphere-.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). During Sphere’s standalone existence, it aimed to bring organization to group conversations on mobile. As shown on Sphere’s website, some of its features included self-clearing feeds, auto-archiving, and call-outs for important messages. It also let users hold interactive conversations categorized by specific interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmM0Of"&gt;The Sphere acquisition marks the second startup that D’Aloisio has sold; in 2013, when he was 17, D’Aloisio sold his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/1/3583720/summly-nick-d-aloisio"&gt;news summarizer startup Summly&lt;/a&gt; to Yahoo for $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdlwSR"&gt;All employees on Sphere’s small 20-member team will be joining Twitter, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.sphere.me/sphere-has-joined-twitter-e7127cfe0467"&gt;Sphere’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Nick Caldwell, Twitter’s vice president of engineering, tweeted that Sphere will be helping Twitter tackle Communities, DMS, and Creators roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dtB4NB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Sphere team’s expertise and leadership’s passion for finding ways to help people connect will help accelerate our Communities, DM, and Creators roadmaps.  &lt;/p&gt;— Nick Caldwell   ‍ ⚡️ (@nickcald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1450854466127683588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5x45jA"&gt;It’ll be especially interesting to see Sphere’s impact on Twitter’s invitation-only Communities, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661649/twitter-releases-communities-facebook-groups-reddit-competitor"&gt;the feature it launched in September to compete with Facebook Groups&lt;/a&gt;. Communities let users join spaces for specific interests, such as for sneaker collectors or for skincare lovers. Although Communities are invite-only for now, Sphere may be able to help speed up the process and make the feature become available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpm30M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
