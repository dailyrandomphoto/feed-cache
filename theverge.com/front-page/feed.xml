    <title>Republican operatives sidestep Facebook policies ahead of Georgia runoff</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uZfcEv"&gt;As the Georgia runoff election nears, Facebook’s messy political ad rules have created new opportunities for operatives and political groups looking to spread disinformation. In the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s election, Republican super PACs have used Facebook to spread disinformation targeting Georgia voters in the last few critical days before the state’s special election on Tuesday, January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkE7yn"&gt;In one instance, the Republican Party wrongly accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris of conspiring to remove President-elect Joe Biden from office in a Facebook ad, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/04/technology-202-republican-facebook-ads-targeting-georgia-runoff-contain-disinformation-researchers-find/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Senate Leadership Fund has also run false ads suggesting that Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff would “defund the police,” despite the candidate refusing to support such a position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtZm3p"&gt;Republican super PAC American Crossroads has run several dishonest ads about Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock over the last few weeks, &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/facebook-fails-georgia"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Popular Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In one example, the PAC published an ad of Warnock saying “God damn America,” framing it as if he was making an un-American statement. However, the clip came from a 2013 speech in which Warnock was quoting &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/facebook-fails-georgia"&gt;a noted speech from Rev. Jeremiah Wright&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCvXfG"&gt;Facebook later removed the ad, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1341089874150088704?s=20"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from spokesperson Andy Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F51YO"&gt;Facebook’s political advertising policies have also led to misleading fundraising outside of Georgia. The week before the November presidential election, Facebook shut down the ability for advertisers to submit new political ads for approval. On December 16th, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176825/facebook-political-ad-ban-resume-georgia-senate-runoff-elections"&gt;started allowing&lt;/a&gt; authorized advertisers to run ads for the Georgia runoff election. With most other political advertising still shut down, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) ran ads allegedly raising money for Georgia’s Republican Senate candidates. But &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ted-cruz-is-pocketing-the-money-hes-raising-for-georgia-gopers-hes-not-alone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast &lt;/em&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that money accrued from those ads was going directly to Cruz. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) were also found to have fundraised through this advertising loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maYADc"&gt;With control of the Senate hanging in the balance, the runoff election appears to be a dead heat, with &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/final-polls-show-loeffler-vs-warnock-ossoff-vs-perdue-dead-heat-1-day-before-georgia-election-1558744"&gt;nearly all final polls&lt;/a&gt; projecting 1 percent margins between candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yAgOb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google may be updating the Nest Hub by adding Soli gestures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KpT5SLY9C4kzL1H9brnw43Zv2b8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617668/dseifert_181018_3039_1286.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XtiJfJ"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub may be getting an update for the first time since its debut in 2018. The company registered a new “interactive device” &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A4RGUIK2"&gt;at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; that’ll feature a screen, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Zigbee support, along with what seems to be Google’s Soli radar gesture technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPDF8F"&gt;Taken together, it seems that Google has a new smart home device of some sort on the way; &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/04/new-nest-hub-fcc/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that “interactive device” classification is similar to what Google uses for its other smart devices like the original Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max, Nest Mini, Nest Wifi, and Nest Audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CJ4lkA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s working on something new&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlOm2o"&gt;The addition of Zigbee — a popular smart home networking standard — would help integrate whatever the new device is even better into smart home setups. And Soli tech has appeared in Google’s smart home devices before, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;entry-level Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; released last year, which uses the technology for detecting when users are nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqvcAB"&gt;According to the FCC filing, the unknown smart device is rated for the same, broader 58-63.5 GHz range of frequencies as the Pixel 4, which, unlike the Nest Thermostat, used the Soli technology for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20907715/google-pixel-4-motion-sense-gesture-controls-radar-sensor-project-soli-demo-features"&gt;its Motion Sense gestures&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to imagine Google using the radar technology for motion gestures on a next-generation version of its smaller Nest Hub, which lacks the integrated camera that the larger Nest Hub Max already uses for similar gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxH3Y6"&gt;Lastly, the Nest Hub is one of Google’s oldest smart home products (having launched back in October 2018). It actually predates the use of the Nest brand for Google’s smart home products — the device first was released as the Google Home Hub — so it’s probably due for a refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKPML9"&gt;Unfortunately, the FCC filing doesn’t reveal many other details for the mysterious product. But if Google is already working on regulatory registration, we may not have too long to wait. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro rumored to offer faster 45W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AVy6hpGVXZpDnqLOrcm_Qjv40M=/0x1:1874x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617635/oneplus_9_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked prototype of the OnePlus 9.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-9-pro-45w-wireless-charging-specs-features-rumors_id129312" target="_blank"&gt;PhoneArena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="chat-messages-795702904228413470"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is rumored to feature faster 45W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging for filling up accessories like wireless headphones, according to a post from &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@maxjmb/oneplus-9-pro-45w-wireless-charging-1609755049-1189681637"&gt;Max Jambor at &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OxV9Y"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro was the first OnePlus device to feature wireless charging, but it was capped at 30W. A bump up to 45W would be a notable increase and could allow for even faster charging speeds than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;8 Pro’s 50 percent charge in 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. Faster wireless charging might also indicate that the OnePlus 9 Pro could feature the 65W wired charging of the OnePlus 8T, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/04/oneplus-9-pro-wireless-charging-45w/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;However OnePlus decides to improve charging, it could potentially be useful if other flagship features like an improved display and 5G support drain the battery faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snBpCt"&gt;Reverse wireless charging on the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a first for OnePlus. Over the last few years, several flagship Android phones have adopted the feature, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;Pixel 5’s Battery Share&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/wireless-powershare/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wireless PowerShare&lt;/a&gt; on the Galaxy S20 line. Like these phones, reverse wireless charging will likely be slower than what you could get from a wired connection, but it’s still a handy feature for OnePlus to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjmWzo"&gt;The rest of the OnePlus Pro 9 remains a mystery, but images and specs for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;a prototype of the OnePlus 9 have leaked&lt;/a&gt;, giving us a pretty good indication of the main features of the new line. A few notable ones include a 120Hz display, a Snapdragon 888 processor, and a 4,500mAh battery. Look out for more leaks and rumors as we get closer to the expected spring launch of OnePlus’ newest phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmVTIW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there just isn’t a deal happening, we’ll mention how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, carrying forth the same 7.9-inch display and design from previous iterations with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that also supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon has the fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J61FCVN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=02d0ad7c6f8a364fc5cf9c4fd7d37de4&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$559 if you buy it in sky blue&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the one that came in 2018, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;

Each size supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the 128GB model with Wi-Fi on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631S3BP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ec9f3ab0f5e7827303dfa0d2a8efa4c7&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $750&lt;/a&gt; and the 256GB configuration &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5de51a395ed06fc6671cc2868597f47a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $849&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Byton partners with Foxconn, but extends shutdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIv3Af6P4fXFTsmpBex1OYBzow0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617583/byton_m_byte_0326.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4AIEZd"&gt;Chinese EV startup Byton has signed a manufacturing deal with iPhone-maker Foxconn, which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-04/foxconn-in-talks-with-chinese-ev-startup-byton-for-funding"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; could be worth around $200 million. In exchange, Foxconn — which has been eager to get into electric vehicles — will provide Byton with “advanced manufacturing technology, operation management expertise and supply chain resources.” The two will apparently work together to get Byton’s M-Byte electric SUV across the finish line into production for the Chinese market in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNF5zC"&gt;The deal comes at a time when Byton is truly struggling. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308389/byton-chinese-ev-startup-operations-suspended-furloughs"&gt;suspended operations last year&lt;/a&gt; amid a cash crunch that was exacerbated by the pandemic and is now extending that suspension until June 2021, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;and local Chinese media reports. It has also largely abandoned Silicon Valley, laying off hundreds of employees there who had been working on R&amp;amp;D and marketing. Byton is now ostensibly being folded into the larger corporate structure at First Auto Works (FAW), China’s original state-owned automaker and a major backer of the startup — something co-founder and former CEO Carsten Breitfeld &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875328/byton-carsten-breitfeld-first-auto-works-chinese-government"&gt;once warned would happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fBuY00"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foxconn has tried for a while to break into electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HoQiQA"&gt;Foxconn’s involvement could be part of that restructuring effort, though the Taiwanese electronics supplier has been interested in Byton for a while. Foxconn in fact helped Byton get off the ground in 2016 when it worked with Tencent to create a company called Future Mobility Corporation that was intended to make electric vehicles, and Future Mobility Corporation eventually turned into Byton. But despite &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-backed-company-aims-to-launch-smart-electric-cars-before-2020-1468302895"&gt;reports that the two tech giants invested in the startup&lt;/a&gt;, they &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/ces-2018-chinese-startup-byton-unveils-45000-gadgetpacked-electric-suv"&gt;never actually put money&lt;/a&gt; into the venture and instead left it to find its own funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj3vwI"&gt;That said, Foxconn has been trying to find a way into the budding electric vehicle space. The electronics giant announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/iphone-to-electric-cars-foxconn-reveals-ev-platform-promises-battery-breakthroughs/"&gt;its own electric vehicle platform&lt;/a&gt; in October. Foxconn also said in January 2020 that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069288/foxconn-fiat-chrysler-electric-vehicles-china-joint-venture"&gt;was working with Fiat Chrysler on electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, though neither company has issued any update on that project in the intervening year. A spokesperson for Fiat Chrysler, &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/psas-shareholders-approve-merger-fiat-chrysler"&gt;which is currently merging with France’s PSA Group&lt;/a&gt;, has repeatedly declined to comment on the status of the partnership over the last year, and Foxconn has not responded to multiple requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IihKWu"&gt;Foxconn could also presumably be interested in working on the tech inside Byton’s vehicles, like supplying components &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858416/byton-m-byte-production-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;for the massive 48-inch screen that spans the M-Byte’s dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="os4oIr"&gt;Byton first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/1/9/16867332/byton-electric-ev-car-ride-first-look-test-touchscreen-ces-2018"&gt;revealed a concept of its electric SUV at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt;. It announced the deal with FAW the following year and finished construction of a factory in Nanjing, China — something many of its peers have yet to achieve. But Byton simultaneously burned through the hundreds of millions of dollars it had raised along the way. It returned to CES in 2020 with a production-ready prototype and was still looking for new funding as the COVID-19 pandemic hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkfUIB"&gt;Byton came out of CES having generated “very strong momentum” with investors, ranging from pension funds to major automakers, according to one former employee with knowledge of the company’s funding. But when the global economy stalled in response to the pandemic, “things started deteriorating pretty quickly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjG9PR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla’s success helped aim a fire hose of cash at EV startups in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Ej1yEW"&gt;The startup had not built up the kind of cash reserves to withstand such an event, this person said, opting instead to plow pretty much all of its roughly $820 million of investments into developing the factory and getting the SUV ready for production while it looked for more funding. (This person said Byton made 200 pre-production prototypes by the time it shut down last June). Byton also took on a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/china/ev-startup-byton-acquires-debt-laden-faw-unit-gain-production-license"&gt;debt&lt;/a&gt;, including to FAW, that ultimately put it in even greater peril. But lacking the funding to move forward, Byton’s factory — once seen as an asset — ultimately became “an albatross,” Michael Dunne, the head of Chinese automotive consulting group ZoZo Go, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC5S3M"&gt;Byton’s struggles hit a fever pitch just before a rush of new interest — and more importantly, cash — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"&gt;entered the electric vehicle space&lt;/a&gt;, lifting up startups with far less developed products. As as result, Byton’s dire financial situation seems to have inspired it to basically pull up its North American roots, letting hundreds of employees go across 2020. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314730/byton-lordstown-karma-ppp-loans-coronavirus-bailout-layoffs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, Byton has even stopped paying its lawyers in a lawsuit against the company’s former CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjbOQT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venmo adds check cashing feature for some US customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Venmo mobile payment service..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePWJSplrpirIqQVKPwUyp2l5CH8=/0x417:5000x3750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617280/1229106193.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;PayPal-owned banking app Venmo is launching a check cashing feature for both its Android and iOS apps for “eligible” users in the US, the &lt;a href="http://blog.venmo.com/2021/1/3/cash-a-check-with-venmo-now-available-for-select-customers"&gt;company announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Cash a Check will allow users to snap a photo of a check and deposit it into a Venmo account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbETQg"&gt;The review process that makes the funds available should only take a few seconds, but in some cases may take up to an hour, the company says. Fees will apply to most check deposits, but Venmo is waiving the fees for deposits of stimulus checks for a limited time. Its usual fees, according to&lt;a href="https://www.ingomoney.com/partners/paypal-terms-conditions/"&gt; PayPal’s terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, will include a 5 percent check cashing fee for hand-signed payroll and government checks for a minimum fee of $5 and 1 percent fees on payroll or government checks with pre-printed signatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zjw7p"&gt;To use Cash a Check, a Venmo customer has to have either a Venmo debit card or direct deposit active on their account, as well as a verified email address. The feature will also require location services to be active. Venmo has partnered with First Century Bank and Ingo Money, the latter of which provides the check cashing services for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fus%2Fsmarthelp%2Farticle%2Fwhat-is-the-cash-a-check-service-in-the-paypal-app-faq3725&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213387%2Fvenmo-check-cashing-paypal-customers-banking#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the PayPal app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsC5xC"&gt;The check cashing feature, which most banks already have some version of (usually without fees for customers), is Venmo’s latest attempt to widen its array of banking services. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502516/venmo-credit-card-spending-cash-back-visa-mastercard-app-payments-mobile"&gt;Venmo launched its first credit card&lt;/a&gt; to “select customers” in the US, each with its own unique QR code and RFID chip, and cash back rewards based on a user’s spending habits rather than rewards for pre-selected categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvEwwV"&gt;And parent company PayPal announced in October it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527288/paypal-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-venmo-bitcoin"&gt;begin supporting cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, with plans to roll out cryptocurrencies to Venmo sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdtM1p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68HXYB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3vCB8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game-beating Nier: Automata cheat code discovered after nearly four years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nier: Automata" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dD_F9lpeigzeNasUk4fs-hH30Mo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68617246/NieR_Automata_201604_SS_2B9S_01_ONLINE.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Platinum Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAFsgb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt;, the mind-bending roleplaying game from legendary Japanese director Yoko Taro, has one last magnificent secret, discovered nearly four years after the game’s release. The secret, a cheat code you can input in the game’s intro sequence to skip to the very end of the game, was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1345615588106780672"&gt;unearthed by modder Lance McDonald&lt;/a&gt;, who said he spent hundreds of hours reverse-engineering &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata &lt;/em&gt;to come across this ultra-rare find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45SVbQ"&gt;For those interested, the cheat is a relatively simple button sequence you must input while positioning main character 2B between a set of barrels during the game’s very first boss fight, something no player would think to do unless they dug deep into the game’s code. Without spoiling much about the game’s rather unorthodox storytelling structure, this cheat will send you all the way to the post-credits sequence and unlock chapter select, a feat that normally takes tens of hours of gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFvG39"&gt;According to McDonald, he only sought to find the cheat code after he was teased by Taro two years ago: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7OeZll"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ok Here it is! After being teased by the game's director &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@yokotaro&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, I discovered the "Final secret" in NieR Automata. Please take a moment to watch and retweet, as it was a monumental task. Also please enjoy the familiar cameo in the intro: &lt;a href="https://t.co/XwhqDN5RmU"&gt;https://t.co/XwhqDN5RmU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TfIMcHmriQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TfIMcHmriQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1345964287496343552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSRdLc"&gt;Taro confirmed the cheat code was intentional and, as McDonald suggested, “hard-coded into the engine,” with a sly tweet referencing the amount of time it took the mod and secret-hunting communities to uncover it. He also included a characteristically inexplicable &lt;em&gt;“（◎血◎）” &lt;/em&gt;symbol, perhaps to express his surprise that someone actually went through the effort to find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzlmbn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;( NieR:Automata Spoilers )&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;3 years 10 months.&lt;br&gt;（◎血◎）&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@manfightdragon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found a cheat code in NieR Automata (snip) &lt;a href="https://t.co/2LeNlBguLi"&gt;https://t.co/2LeNlBguLi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— yokotaro (@yokotaro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1345714490067746816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ekMJ16"&gt;Beyond its deserved reputation as one of the most narratively complex and challenging stories ever told in video game format, &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; is also filled with scores of Easter eggs, meta commentary, and coy tricks played on the player. So it’s characteristic of Taro and his colleagues at developer Platinum to have thought to put something like this in the game, fully intending no one to ever find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3uVNQ"&gt;But of course, a game as off-the-wall as &lt;em&gt;Nier &lt;/em&gt;has, in turn, inspired a fan base obsessed with everything it has to offer. So perhaps it was only a matter of time before someone like McDonald put the time and effort in to find this game-winning cheat code. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack starts 2021 with a massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hmEn0gT2hC75DNR_TmjXVKGriw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68616251/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hY6sOv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-01/9ecc1bc75347b6d1"&gt;Slack is down&lt;/a&gt; on the first full work day of 2021. The company said Monday morning “Customers may have trouble loading channels or connecting to Slack at this time. Our team is investigating and we will follow up with more information as soon as we have it. We apologize for any disruption caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfkjSd"&gt;Users began reporting issues around 10AM ET, and the company posted its first status update about the problem at 10:14AM. As of 12:29PM ET, the service appeared to be slowly returning to normal for some users — we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; were able to transition back to Slack and resume work there at around 1:30PM ET, and we’ve had no disruptions since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gbrDr"&gt;At first, Slack was reporting issues with connecting to the service and messaging. An update on its status page at 11:20AM ET upgraded the situation to a full-blown outage, with all aspects of Slack— including log-ins, messaging, calls, and connections— showing as unavailable. “All hands are on deck on our end to further investigate,” according to the &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-01/9ecc1bc75347b6d1"&gt;update page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHrjws"&gt;Slack’s latest update at 1:51PM ET suggests the company is still working to resolve some lingering issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YWbpM3"&gt;For those customers who are unable to access Slack (e.g. seeing a blank screen or error), please try reloading (CTRL/CMD + R). Otherwise, please hold off on reloading, as this could prevent you from accessing Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlNnpO"&gt;In addition, Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar aren’t working as expected, and some email notifications (e.g. a notification of a new direct message in Slack) are failing to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kgnDBp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Slack has upgraded the problem to a full outage of its services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heftUf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 12:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the service may be returning for some users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAouLE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:14PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Slack’s latest update note, and that we at The Verge don’t seem to be experiencing issues anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Persona soundtracks are coming to Spotify tomorrow at midnight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NeWHewT36rlGS5LT9UUYVsQQjMk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68616858/Persona_5_Royal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KJmAlD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;-heads rejoice: it looks like all the original soundtracks for most of the games are coming to Spotify tomorrow at midnight. That’s right. The news comes courtesy of AniPlaylist, purveyors of fine anime song playlists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1mIV9t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;At midnight, on January 5th... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Persona [Original Soundtracks &amp;amp; more] will be available on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Spotify&lt;/a&gt; ❤️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Playlist with all albums: &lt;a href="https://t.co/lwIU3If6Gk"&gt;https://t.co/lwIU3If6Gk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/N4YyBvoDuo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N4YyBvoDuo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AniPlaylist (@AniPlaylist) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AniPlaylist/status/1346116312850903040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x8MDci"&gt;According to their Twitter account, the music includes main game soundtracks from &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona 4 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona 3 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Persona 3 FES&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Persona 2. &lt;/em&gt;There’s also a bunch more stuff, apparently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jqHNri"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Main games soundtracks:&lt;br&gt;- Persona 5 OST&lt;br&gt;- P4 &amp;amp; Golden OST&lt;br&gt;- P3 &amp;amp; FES OST&lt;br&gt;- P2 Sound Collections&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But also: &lt;br&gt;- P4 Dancing All Night OST&lt;br&gt;- P4 Arena Ultimax OST&lt;br&gt;- Never More -Reincarnation: Persona 4-&lt;br&gt;- P3 &amp;amp; P4 Vocal Sound Collection&lt;br&gt;- PQ &amp;amp; PQ2 OST&lt;br&gt;- MUSIC FES 2013&lt;br&gt;- SUPER LIVE 2015&lt;/p&gt;— AniPlaylist (@AniPlaylist) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AniPlaylist/status/1346116423429582852?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NiOST"&gt;Part of what makes these games so special to so many people is how good the soundtracks are; they give the game worlds personality, life, and a characteristic flair. Make some time for them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are so big that Ikea has mock consoles in store to help you buy a media cabinet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sB-VZxw00SHIl7Vuh7EVDd2hL5M=/0x36:576x420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68616850/o2019i6nu5961.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/kppuaz/which_ikea_media_storage_unit_will_be_able_to_fit/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link" target="_blank"&gt;u/TomaccoTastesLikeGma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWraHK"&gt;The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are very large consoles — in fact, the PS5 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438782/sony-ps5-size-specs-dimensions-console-huge-large-big"&gt;biggest game console in modern history&lt;/a&gt;. Their sizes can make buying a new entertainment center that can actually fit them somewhat of a challenge. But Ikea has a solution to help you out: the company made physical sizing guides in the form of lookalike boxes to help you figure out which cabinets and entertainment centers can house the new consoles. The sizing guides were photographed by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/kppuaz/which_ikea_media_storage_unit_will_be_able_to_fit/"&gt;a user on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRQM78"&gt;The mock boxes are approximately the same shape as the consoles, with measurements written on the side. There’s also some great marketing copy on the PS5 mock box to explain exactly what it should be used for: “Which Ikea media storage unit will be able to fit my new, meme-ishly oversized, gaming console?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uNWIAS"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-01-04T16:21:53.252475+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/kppuaz/which_ikea_media_storage_unit_will_be_able_to_fit/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;"Which IKEA media storage unit will be able to fit my new, meme-ishly oversized, game console?"&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/"&gt;gaming&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mIoFx5"&gt;The lookalike boxes seem like they’d be really handy. You won’t have to haul your actual PS5 or Xbox Series X to Ikea just to make sure they’ll fit in your next entertainment center. (The new consoles are pretty heavy!) But the decision about whether to stand the consoles upright in vertical orientation or lay them horizontally is up to you. (I’m on team vertical.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VJzQvw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Confirmed: The PS5 is the biggest game console in modern history","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438782/sony-ps5-size-specs-dimensions-console-huge-large-big"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
