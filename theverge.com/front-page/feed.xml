    <title>All 53,000 attendees of Anime NYC urged to get tested after one got Omicron</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="psfhUZ"&gt;Were you one of the 53,000 attendees of the Anime NYC 2021 convention in New York City, or know someone who did? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1466473589180403714"&gt;New York City authorities&lt;/a&gt; and Anime NYC organizers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animenyc/status/1466549890947895300"&gt;are urging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;every single attendee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;exhibitor, artist, and staff member&lt;/em&gt; to get tested for COVID-19 — because one of the United States’ first confirmed cases of the new omicron variant was a man who attended the convention and likely caught it there (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-the-usas-first-omicron-cases-attended-big-anime-1848152747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YYpdrz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you attended the Anime NYC 2021 Convention at the Javits Center from November 18-22, get tested for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;➡️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/fESkqpcKQo"&gt;https://t.co/fESkqpcKQo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/niI8ENg3ez"&gt;pic.twitter.com/niI8ENg3ez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— City of New York (@nycgov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1466473589180403714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="GMRcBO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Anime NYC team was notified today that one of this year’s attendees tested positive for the Omicron variant of COVID-19. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, the attendee developed mild symptoms on November 22, was tested on November 24, and their &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AqpJuLIjTQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AqpJuLIjTQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anime NYC (@animenyc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animenyc/status/1466549890947895300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FW6jCv"&gt;Omicron is the new coronavirus variant previously only known to have infected at least one fully vaccinated patient in the US &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-reports-first-case-omicron-variant-2021-12-01/"&gt;as of yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, but now &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minnesota-omicron-variant-case-rcna6909"&gt;also identified in&lt;/a&gt; California, Minnesota, Colorado and New York State, less than a week after &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1201-omicron-variant.html"&gt;being classified by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1466545026587111427"&gt;In a press conference today&lt;/a&gt;, New York governor Kathy Hochul said her state alone now has five confirmed omicron cases, and NYC mayor Bill de Blasio warned New Yorkers that they should assume there’s community spread. Hochul suggested that so far, all the US cases of the omicron variant have been minor; the man who attended Anime NYC has reportedly already recovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QON8gO"&gt;He was from Minnesota; &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2021/covid120221.html"&gt;the Minnesota Department of Health says&lt;/a&gt; he had already been vaccinated, and developed mild symptoms the day after the convention. He hadn’t been outside the United States recently, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/us/minnesota-omicron-case.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting he may have gotten it at the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um2Shu"&gt;“Anyone who attended the AnimeNYC conference, especially anyone experiencing symptoms, should get tested immediately and take additional precautions including social distancing,” reads part of a statement from de Blasio. “I urge all New Yorkers to get vaccinated, wear a face mask while indoors and in public, and help our city beat this virus once and for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfpLyf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google reportedly re-evaluates January 10th return to office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwFkWeZXQOiE_X-82ZXA096OIJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221858/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e2KSsa"&gt;Google is reportedly changing its return-to-office plans again, saying that its US employees won’t have to adopt a hybrid work model come January 10th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;as was previously planned&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/google-workers-in-us-wont-return-to-office-as-expected-on-jan-10.html"&gt;a report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the plan now is to hold off on coming up with new plans until next year, with decisions regarding timelines left up to local offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQSa35"&gt;The company has changed its return to work plans several times as the pandemic evolved. In August, when the delta variant was a growing concern, we learned that the company intended to keep in-office work voluntary until at least January 10th, 2022. That plan itself was a change from a previous one that was revealed in December 2020, which would have had employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;returning in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsZbxO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As COVID has changed, so have company’s plans to bring employees back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBBe19"&gt;According to CNBC’s report, Google will give full-time employees a 30-day period to transition from working remotely to working in the office when it does start to bring them back in. It also seems like it’s still going to make changes to its structure — the email seen by CNBC mentioned “experiment[ing] with more flexible ways of working,” which lines up with what we heard in December when Google was looking into testing a hybrid work model that had eligible employees spending some time at home and some time in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsIPhY"&gt;Google reportedly has 90 percent of its US offices open for employees to come in on a voluntary basis. CNBC says Google is encouraging employees to come in “to reconnect with colleagues in person and start regaining the muscle memory of being in the office more regularly.” Whether this will continue to be possible remains to be seen and will likely be dictated by the US’s response as more cases of &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/22813896/omicron-covid-variant-cases-hospitalizations-vaccines"&gt;the omicron variant&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus continue to pop up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ssgxb"&gt;Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JDazFb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple employees will return to offices February 1st in a hybrid work pilot","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Signal launches in-app sustainer program to accept donations from users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/39vzEF8J-SgTiy-5WXQKzeHXAoM=/18x0:2216x1465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221818/signal_sustainer.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Signal users can make donations to the company within the app | Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AyMfoF"&gt;Secure messaging app Signal has launched a new feature that allows users to make donations within the app, the company announced. As a nonprofit, Signal doesn’t receive financial support from any advertisers or shareholders, a new &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/become-a-signal-sustainer/"&gt;blog post notes&lt;/a&gt;, and relies on users for donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK4IPg"&gt;Users can choose to make monthly donations, or one-off contributions within the app using Apple Pay or Google Pay, and their payment information won’t be associated with a user’s Signal account, according to the blog post, as the company will use the same anonymous credential &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416.pdf"&gt;scheme&lt;/a&gt; it uses for private Signal groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WKq6HB"&gt;Clients make payments and then associate a badge to their profile such that the server can authenticate the client is in the set of people who made a payment, but doesn’t know specifically which payment it corresponds to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PFsklb"&gt;Long a popular messaging app for people who want to secure their text messages, earlier this year, Signal began adding some of the more consumer-friendly features that other messaging apps have had for a while, like stickers and wallpapers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fED2bE"&gt;To donate to Signal, users can choose from three different sustainer levels, at $5, $10, or $20, each with its own badge. Sustainer subscriptions will only renew if a customer uses Signal during the course of a month; if you uninstall or stop using the app, the payments will be canceled before the next cycle to “eliminate the ‘dark pattern’ of subscriptions you’ve forgotten about,” the company said. Signal plans to add support for additional payment methods in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the Steam Deck’s box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W48YACM1q0d8ahLg2l6Sxj-PNKA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221728/7e80e144f730c0cb160c03beb2a6dfe8ffcd503b.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck in its box.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amDoam"&gt;Valve has shared a preview of the Steam Deck’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3122680206583792325"&gt;final package design&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the handheld gaming PC’s recently delayed launch date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aiyh8J"&gt;Each Steam Deck comes with the console and a carrying case, and Valve revealed in these photos that each device also comes with its own USB-C power supply, meaning you won’t have to source your own like you have to with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/14/22231102/samsung-apple-kill-charging-brick-obituary-eulogy"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt;. The box also has a handful of fun Easter eggs for Valve superfans — I’ve spotted a few &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; references myself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-d_J_oaiEapoNRlhZI8KNtFt1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23059318/5ef112bba136d6c5bcb26f2cc785822b2cb35563.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck’s box, closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGFstA"&gt;Valve says it’s testing the packaging design, so there could be some changes from what you see in the pictures when the Steam Deck ships next year. The company also says it has completed its design validation manufacturing build of the Steam Deck and that there will be “additional minor changes in the final product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPG5e1"&gt;In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;Valve delayed the Steam Deck’s launch&lt;/a&gt; by two months, from December 2021 to February 2022, due to global supply chain issues. The company revealed a lot of details about the device at a developer summit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"&gt;just a couple days later&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NH8hVK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Steam Deck: Five big things we learned from Valve’s developer summit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"},{"title":"Steam Deck launch delayed by two months","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0LdPwz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, December 2nd, 6:54PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve delayed the Steam Deck’s launch date last month, not this month as we originally stated. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom might pay you $25 as part of a class-action settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVAjQiHR5CBtzU6QiH6AEpSaOds=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221525/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3ULLP"&gt;Zoom has reached &lt;a href="https://www.zoommeetingsclassaction.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf"&gt;a settlement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; in a class-action lawsuit over alleged privacy and security issues, and if you used the videoconferencing app before July, then you could be eligible to receive money as a result. The company has agreed to pay $85 million while continuing to deny the allegations and any liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8TgGt"&gt;There are two groups eligible to file a claim. If you paid for a Zoom Meetings App subscription between March 30th, 2016, and July 30th, 2021, you can file a claim for $25 or 15 percent of what you paid for that subscription (excluding optional add-ons). You’re entitled to whichever is greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WIS7YK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The plaintiffs allege Zoom failed to prevent Zoombombing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d5grfY"&gt;The second bucket is much broader. If you aren’t eligible for the first group but you “registered, used, opened, or downloaded the Zoom Meeting App” between March 30th, 2016, and July 30th, 2021, you can file a claim for $15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ImKzq"&gt;However, if you have only used Zoom with an “Enterprise-Level Account” or a government account, you’re excluded from the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5TDxH"&gt;Claims must be submitted by March 5th, 2022. You can file a claim online &lt;a href="https://www.zoommeetingsclassaction.com/Home/SubmitClaim"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or by mailing a &lt;a href="https://www.zoommeetingsclassaction.com/Content/Documents/Claim%20Form.pdf"&gt;completed claim form&lt;/a&gt;. However, payment amounts “may increase or decrease” depending on how many people submit claims, according to the settlement’s website. The settlement has been preliminarily approved by the court, and a final approval hearing is scheduled for April 7th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSCWf5"&gt;The plaintiffs in the lawsuit allege Zoom shared users’ information with third parties in an unauthorized manner through SDKs and marketplace apps, that it failed to prevent “unwanted meeting disruptions by third parties” (aka “Zoombombing”), and that Zoom misrepresented its end-to-end encryption (which the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535818/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-e2ee-security-privacy-video-conferencing"&gt;has since fixed&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and Best Buy are both discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s also on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Both models are also available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version with a silver aluminum case and an abyss blue sport band for $239 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other configurations — as well as the larger, 44mm model with GPS — are currently only available at full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled blue configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7KQg2qO7Z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blue variant at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for $299, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s available in white, pink, red, and black at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $329, its best-ever price. This discontinued model currently only has limited availability other retailers for full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. There are very few deals to speak of right now, however, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model with a green Sport Band and green aluminum casing for $380 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a $20 discount, this same deal also applies to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HDYWTPV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the red variant, also available for $380&lt;/a&gt;. The 45mm model with GPS is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in red for $410.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My mad dash to catch up in time for Final Fantasy XIV’s Endwalker expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFwFQbLUcp0lxD_NcSbDzMIDtHI=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221383/stormblood.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kPgkdN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is coming, and I’m not ready for it. I came to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; only this year, ravenously tearing through &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; before abandoning the game somewhere in the middle of &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;, which is generally considered to be inferior to the other FFXIV expansions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeCH33"&gt;Then news of a new expansion hit, rekindling my desire to restart my journey, hopefully finishing in time for &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s launch. I harbored no illusions about my ability to power through one-and-a-half expansions’ worth of content before December 8th, but I could try, and trying meant getting through &lt;em&gt;Stormblood &lt;/em&gt;first. So I proposed an experiment: &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; will go down for maintenance at 4AM EST in preparation for a new patch and to open up &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; early access for the lucky chosen. If I could finish &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; before the servers go down, I’d be in a good spot to get close to the end of &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt; in time to start &lt;em&gt;Endwalker,&lt;/em&gt; if not by launch day, then that same week. Could I do it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZtAls"&gt;Without knowing where I was in the &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; main story questline and dedicated to the foolish idea of keeping my tank and healer jobs evenly leveled, I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k9ddYo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Could I finish Stormblood before the servers go down at 4AM?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gkXXyk"&gt;One thing I appreciate about &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; is that it respects your time. If you want to play multiple classes in other MMOs — like &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; —  you have to level different characters for each class, often forcing you to repeat content. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;’s job system lets you level as many classes as you want on the same character seamlessly. I can bounce between my gunbreaker tank and astrologian healer while progressing through the main story quest with relative ease. I’ve even developed a method by which I kept those two classes close in level. I’d gain two levels on my gunbreaker, then switch to my astrologian and catch up, rinse and repeat. It’s not a perfect system. Sometimes I’d get too far ahead in the main story quest on one class such that when I switched to the other class, I didn’t meet the level requirement to continue, forcing me to stop progression and grind a little bit to make up for lost XP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQuYV2"&gt;Now you’d think in the mad dash to finish &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; before server maintenance locks me out of the game that I’d give up this quirky leveling dance in favor of picking one class and powering through. You would be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBcs1r"&gt;I, like Thanos, am a creature of balance. If my class levels fall too far out of sync, there’s a greater chance that one class would be left behind to toil in meaningless side-quests to catch up. I hate grinding with a passion. There’s a reason I’ve only created one character in a decade of playing &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;. I enjoy both classes too much to leave one behind because of my stubborn refusal to grind, and that rule stuck even when time was of the essence. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PN5T4hUjTMmZdhFcYul6mTnTg5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23059180/2021_12_01__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;My gunbreaker, cute as a button she is.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lEEg04"&gt;At around midnight, I had about 700,000 XP to go to even out my class levels and unlock the next main story quest. I decided to hop across the map completing fates, which are timed quests with large XP rewards anyone can participate in. I was alone, finishing a fate, when a player joined me. I didn’t catch their name, but when we finished the fate, they performed the kiss emote in thanks. I went to the next fate, and there they were again, and again for the fate after that. I loved it. Our purposes were temporarily aligned (they were probably in need of a quick grinding session like I was), and we had this very human connection and cooperation while never actually speaking to each other, communicating only in emotes. For a moment, there was a bond forged — and just as quick as it came, it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7jO2g"&gt;Most of my MMO-playing life has been dedicated to being a damage dealer because I didn’t think I was capable of handling the responsibility that comes with being a tank or a healer. You can generally muddle through with a bad damage dealer, but if the tank or healer sucks, it’s game over. I decided to step out of my comfort zone by playing those classes in&lt;em&gt; FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;, and while my confidence in these roles has improved, I still get anxious when it’s time to do a story dungeon. I spent an incredible amount of time last night trying to level my healer to 70 because, even though my tank was already at level 70 and could go on to finish the final dungeon, thereby finishing &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; with time to spare, I was &lt;em&gt;terrified&lt;/em&gt; of tanking that dungeon. &lt;a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Royal_Menagerie"&gt;The dungeon’s&lt;/a&gt; single boss fight was so complex with so many mechanics to remember and watch out for that I thought there was no way I’d get through it without killing the party, wasting precious time. I spent a lot of time I couldn’t really afford to spare getting my healer to 70 so I could do the much easier (but still incredibly stressful) job of healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2CSPKc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For a moment, there was a bond forged — and just as quick as it came, it was over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SgDnkZ"&gt;I reached 70 on my healer by 3AM. The servers go down in an hour, I’m bleary-eyed and hunched over my keyboard, but I made it. Once I finish this dungeon, I’m done. And that should be a quick task because while damage dealers have to wait exceedingly long times to get into a dungeon, healers don’t, as they are generally in higher demand with a lower supply. I entered the queue, and I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNvIAq"&gt;And waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJAIo4"&gt;Oh shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWAY3Z"&gt;What I thought would be an instantaneous queue stretched on and on because my dumb, sleep-deprived ass didn’t realize that most people still playing &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; an hour before server maintenance probably have better things to do than queuing for a dungeon from an expansion ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E3I5ch"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;lol i really did think i could slide in at the buzzer&lt;br&gt;man plans&lt;br&gt;rhalgr laughs&lt;/p&gt;— Ash Piss-mad Bear Parrish (@adashtra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adashtra/status/1466318211549483012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDICji"&gt;I waited 20 minutes — an unimaginable amount of time as a healer — thinking that my quest to finish &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; before time ran out would end here in failure. Of course, I could come back after maintenance and try again, but I was disappointed because I had come so close to achieving my absolutely bonkers goal. I looked away to tweet my failure, my hand moving toward the escape button as I finished so I could log out in shame. I almost missed the “Duty Commenced” box letting me know the party was full and the dungeon awaited. I very nearly clicked “withdraw” in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02wWhIK-h3iOpuD_rSo3q5wW4_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23059175/2021_12_02__7_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Queue popped at 3:17 AM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yqKljk"&gt;Turns out, my fears about this dungeon were unfounded. My group made light work of the boss, Shinryu, with barely a scratch, let alone a death. We just blew through it like wet tissue paper, even though &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nOaV_O97uzM"&gt;the dungeon guide video&lt;/a&gt; I watched made me believe this boss would wipe the party for the tiniest mistake. To the seven of you who queued for a &lt;em&gt;Stormblood &lt;/em&gt;dungeon in the final minutes before server shutdown, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9uI8T"&gt;Once Shinryu lay dead, and after several dramatic cutscenes, I arrived at &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;’s end with less than 30 minutes to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsWqCp"&gt;I won’t miss &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;. It was a typical revolution story that didn’t seem to match the grandioseness of the stories that came before it. And while &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; didn’t move me the way &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; did, this experience definitely improved my overall impression of it. For me, &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; was an expansion about the journey, not the destination, and this time, the end of the journey was the best. I will look back on the traveling companions who accompanied me through the final minutes of &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; fondly, even though I’ll never remember their names nor much else of what happened in this expansion. Now only &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt; stands between me and my trip to the moon in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, and from what I hear, it’s the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZUpj3"&gt;Will I make it through &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt; in time for &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;? Probably not. But I’ve made &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/my-nine-day-final-fantasy-xv-blitz-commences-tonight-1846096788"&gt;ill-advised sprints through &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; content&lt;/a&gt; before, and &lt;a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/The_Twelve"&gt;by the Twelve&lt;/a&gt;, I can do it again. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="CytRJa"&gt;“Your phone’s front camera is always securely looking for your face, even if you don’t touch it or raise to wake it.” That’s how Qualcomm Technologies vice president of product management Judd Heape &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3H6tfcZLHfg?t=10758"&gt;introduced the company’s new always-on camera capabilities&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor&lt;/a&gt; set to arrive in top-shelf Android phones early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nmar7"&gt;Depending on who you are, that statement can either be exciting or terrifying. For Qualcomm, it thinks this new feature will enable new use cases, like being able to wake and unlock your phone without having to pick it up or have it instantly lock when it no longer sees your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzXm3P"&gt;But for those of us with any sense of how modern technology is used to violate our privacy, a camera on our phone that’s always capturing images &lt;em&gt;even when we’re not using it&lt;/em&gt; sounds like the stuff of nightmares and has a cost to our privacy that far outweighs any potential convenience benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBcjBh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A camera that records your image even when you’re not using it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyu2fQ"&gt;Qualcomm’s main pitch for this feature is for unlocking your phone any time you glance at it, even if it’s just sitting on a table or propped up on a stand. You don’t need to pick it up or tap the screen or say a voice command — it just unlocks when it sees your face. I can see this being useful if your hands are messy or otherwise occupied (in its presentation, Qualcomm used the example of using it while cooking a recipe to check the next steps). Maybe you’ve got your phone mounted in your car, and you can just glance over at it to see driving directions without having to take your hands off the steering wheel or leave the screen on the entire time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrZO2W"&gt;The company is also spinning it as making your phone &lt;em&gt;more secure&lt;/em&gt; by automatically locking the phone when it no longer sees your face or detects someone looking over your shoulder and snooping on your group chat. It can also suppress private information or notifications from popping up if you’re looking at the phone with someone else. Basically, if you’re not looking at it, your phone is locked; if it can see you, it will be unlocked. If it can see you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; someone else, it can automatically lock the phone or hide private information or notifications from displaying on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngEJ0r"&gt;But while those features may sound neat and perhaps even convenient, I’m not convinced that having an always-on camera is worth the tradeoff in privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V6biDe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H6tfcZLHfg?rel=0&amp;amp;start=10758" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrqwzE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The always-on camera features are discussed at hour three of Qualcomm’s four-hour presentation introducing the Snapdragon Gen 1 system-on-chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwLEwb"&gt;Qualcomm is framing the always-on camera as similar to the always-on microphones that have been in our phones for years. Those are used to listen for voice commands like “Hey Siri” or “Hey Google” (or lol, “Hi Bixby”) and then wake up the phone and provide a response, all without you having to touch or pick up the phone. But the difference is that they are listening for specific wake words and are often limited with what they can do until you do actually pick up your phone and unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xePhtk"&gt;It feels a bit different when it’s a camera that’s always scanning for a likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vTo21a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An always-on camera is a step beyond the always-on microphones already in our phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wRk5tL"&gt;It’s true that smart home products already have features like this. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt; uses its camera to recognize your face when you walk up to it and greet you with personal information like your calendar. Home security cameras and video doorbells are constantly on, looking for activity or even specific faces. But those devices are in your home, not always carried with you everywhere you go, and generally don’t have your most private information stored on them, like your phone does. They also frequently have features like physical shutters to block the camera or intelligent modes to disable recording when you’re home and only resume it when you aren’t. It’s hard to imagine any phone manufacturer putting a physical shutter on the front of their slim and sleek flagship smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgoU53"&gt;Lastly, there have been many reports of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322122/verkada-hack-150000-security-cameras-tesla-factory-cloudflare-jails-hospitals"&gt;security breaches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21028092/amazon-ring-camera-hack-password-security-privacy-access-2fa"&gt;social engineering hacks&lt;/a&gt; to enable smart home cameras when they aren’t supposed to be on and then send that feed to remote servers, all without the knowledge of the homeowner. Modern smartphone operating systems now do a good job of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;telling you when an app is accessing your camera or microphone&lt;/a&gt; while you’re using the device, but it’s not clear how they’d be able to inform you of a rogue app tapping into the always-on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3UlWw"&gt;In his presentation, Heape said that “always-on camera data never leaves the secure sensing hub while it’s looking for faces,” implying that the data isn’t sent to the cloud and that apps on the phone won’t be able to access it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXVxf3"&gt;In a follow up conversation after this article was originally published, Heape further clarified how the system works on a technical level. The always-on camera is part of a chain that includes a new low-power image signal processor (ISP) and a machine learning step. All three stages — the camera, the ISP, and the machine learning — are “hardened”, according to Heape, he says that it isn’t possible to inject code into the chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPTcLp"&gt;The always-on camera is limited to a VGA (640 x 480 pixel) resolution, even though it uses the phone’s existing front-facing camera, and the rest of the phone’s systems — the main processor, cellular radios, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc — are turned off. Heape said this low-power ISP “cannot capture photos or video” and  “no image or video is stored” in this process, it only scans to detect if there is a face or not. If the machine learning algorithm determines a face is detected, the rest of the phone’s systems are awakened to authenticate the user and unlock the phone or deny access to it. “It is impossible in the low power state to get an image out of it,” says Heape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6VI9c"&gt;The system does not have a way to inform you that its always-on camera is running, like other facial recognition systems use. Heape said that an OEM could choose to add an indicator such as an LED light if they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjTYfM"&gt;Another Qualcomm Technologies vice president of product management Ziad Asghar told my colleague Chaim Gartenberg that users will also be able to disable the always-on camera feature or possibly even select which features they want to use and which they don’t. “The consumer has the choice to be able to pick and choose as to what is enabled and what’s not enabled,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP4UtH0DVT_0Q539UAZ_GsuJDKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16257180/vpavic_190510_3415_0161.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 7 Pro hid its entire camera system in a motorized pop-up module. Perhaps it’s time to bring this idea back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SFe78n"&gt;It’s also possible that the smartphone manufacturers using the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 won’t even enable this feature at a hardware level. Since Qualcomm doesn’t actually make the smartphones its chips go in (outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568641/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-technology"&gt;one-off novelties&lt;/a&gt; that aren’t widely purchased), companies like Samsung, OnePlus, and Xiaomi can customize which features are enabled on their phones and which aren’t. Heape said that an OEM can request a Snapdragon chip with the feature disabled at the hardware level. Some of those companies already bypass Qualcomm’s image processing components in favor of their own solutions — it’s not hard to see them just skipping the criticisms of privacy concerns and forgoing this feature as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0jhcqA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An unsettling and uncomfortable precedent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPTiXp"&gt;But even if it’s not found in every phone next year, the mere presence of the feature means that it will be used by someone at some point. It sets a precedent that is unsettling and uncomfortable; Qualcomm may be the first with this capability, but it won’t be long before other companies add it in the race to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5e4X5"&gt;Ultimately, it comes down to a level of trust — do you trust that Qualcomm has set up the system in a way that prevents the always-on camera from being used for other purposes than intended? Do you trust that the OEM using Qualcomm’s chips won’t do things to interfere with the system, either for their own profit or to satisfy the demands of a government entity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJm86m"&gt;Even if you do have that trust, there’s a certain level of comfort with an always-on camera on your most personal device that goes beyond where we are currently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lugMRK"&gt;Maybe we’ll just start having to put tape on our smartphone cameras like we already do with laptop webcams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naQ17K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 5:15PM ET, December 2nd, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; After this article was published, Qualcomm vice president of product management Judd Heape gave further information about how the always-on camera system works on a technical level. The company also clarified that the system does not identify the faces it detects; that is handled by the phone’s existing facial identification authentication systems. The article has been updated with this new information and the headline has been changed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ransomware attack on Planned Parenthood LA exposes info for 400,000 patients</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yDY22Rfwpo0ys1woxiJhkwaGH-M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221267/acastro_170621_1777_0003_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulAUkJ"&gt;Hackers were able to access files containing personal information for hundreds of thousands of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles patients with a ransomware attack that occurred in October, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/12/01/los-angeles-planned-parenthood-hack/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/EXPERIAN_H1202_Planned%20Parenthood%20of%20Los%20Angeles_L01_SAS_1.pdf"&gt;letter sent to affected patients by Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; explained that the files contained patients’ names and “one or more of the following: address, insurance information, date of birth, and clinical information, such as diagnosis, procedure, and/or prescription information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5iQsm"&gt;Planned Parenthood says the ransomware was installed on its network some time between October 9th and October 17th. On the 17th, the organization noticed the intrusion, took its systems offline, and contacted law enforcement and cybersecurity investigators. By early November, it had determined what the hackers had access to but is still in the dark about the attack’s perpetrator, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/tech/ransomware-planned-parenthood/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GExkxa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Planned Parenthood is still investigating the hack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZcgWd"&gt;A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood LA told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t seem like the information had been “used for fraudulent purposes” and told CNN that it didn’t appear to be a targeted attack. But the data could be valuable if hackers choose to sell it, given its extremely sensitive nature — Planned Parenthood not only provides abortions but birth control, STD testing, and hormone therapy for trans patients, along with a host of other medical services. According to CNN, the data was limited to Planned Parenthood Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WguvL2"&gt;The cyberattack and data leak come at a time when abortion rights are especially fraught in the US. The Supreme Court is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/us/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law.html"&gt;currently considering a case&lt;/a&gt; to determine the legality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions 15 weeks into pregnancy (as opposed to the 23 weeks set by &lt;em&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/em&gt;), and earlier this year Texas &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033202132/texas-abortion-ban-what-happens-next"&gt;made it illegal&lt;/a&gt; to get an abortion after just six weeks of pregnancy. Texas’ law means that abortions won’t be a legal option by the time most people find out they’re pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PM23a0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This incident blends rising tensions regarding abortion, privacy, and ransomware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="deh26j"&gt;Ransomware attacks have also been a major issue this year, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;US Treasury reporting&lt;/a&gt; that payouts from the attacks could be on track to top a billion dollars for 2021 alone. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/tech/ransomware-planned-parenthood/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood LA didn’t answer questions about whether there was a ransom demand made in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to arrange for your digital legacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cemetery (SHUTTERSTOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L21amYXQFewHblgYg9I43krU7Jo=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221033/shutterstock_13456018.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BiAC84"&gt;I’m about to introduce a topic that most of us would rather avoid: our digital legacy. In other words, what happens to all our digital stuff after we die? (And if your answer is “That’s not gonna happen,” you haven’t been paying a lot of attention lately, have you?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOzpkg"&gt;If you’re reading this, odds are that you’ve got a lot of digital stuff, both on your own devices and floating around in the cloud: backups, photos, tweets, Facebook messages, texts, you name it. If you’re no longer around to pay attention, these can hang around for a very long time — and some of it may be important to your survivors. (For example, who else has the passwords to your bank accounts and credit cards?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgTTqR"&gt;So let’s take a deep breath and discuss how to make things easier for your friends and relatives should something happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7BP3Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What happens to all our digital stuff after we die? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7dZmIj"&gt;To begin with, if you’re old enough (or wise enough) to have arranged for a will, then your executor (the person who is assigned to see that the terms of the will are carried out) will also have legal standing to access your digital assets: online accounts, websites, etc. This is specified by the &lt;a href="https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home?CommunityKey=f7237fc4-74c2-4728-81c6-b39a91ecdf22"&gt;revised Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which has been enacted by the majority of the states in the US. (As of this writing, it had not been passed by California, Oklahoma, or Louisiana; it has been introduced by not yet passed in Massachusetts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux7j0L"&gt;Since it doesn’t do your relatives or friends any good to have the right to take care of your data if they don’t have your passwords, you might want to think about entrusting at least one person with the passwords to your computer and / or your password manager — or think about putting that information in a secure place and let at least one person know where that place is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoXb0c"&gt;However, the Act does not apply to social media sites — which could be a problem. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; include whom you want to entrust with all your social media accounts in your will, which can make things somewhat easier for them — but will still involve a lot of back and forth as they prove their right to handle those accounts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5jpXx"&gt;There are a few companies that have added features to let you plan ahead of time who is authorized to handle your cloud and / or social media accounts if you’re not able to. Listed here are how some of the major online services are (or are not) handling the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zbgz1o"&gt;Apple iCloud Digital Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RbREc2"&gt;Until recently, getting access to the iCloud account of a deceased family member could be extremely difficult, especially if you didn’t have that person’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208072"&gt;recovery key&lt;/a&gt;. However, Apple has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;added a Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt; to its iCloud accounts, which lets you name up to five Legacy Contacts who will have access to your account. The program is available starting with iOS 15.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY6lU7"&gt;To set up your Legacy Contacts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xE6VMc"&gt;Go to Settings and tap on your name at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5thDh1"&gt;Select Password &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Legacy Contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="65b3l2"&gt;This is where you can add the names of people who will be able to access and download your data after your death; it will also list anyone who has listed you as a Legacy Contact. Tap on Add Legacy Contact to add a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A trusted friend or family member can access your iCloud account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbjCTrerbFBnHb9YNQnXw7m5YQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058282/IMG_336C1C7F4E9D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A trusted friend or family member can access your iCloud account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can add up to 10 Legacy Contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8XlGcXACpJpGrq7p5FwWDOHNkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058283/IMG_46BBD3E4A094_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add up to 10 Legacy Contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XkyQ1i"&gt;The next page explains that you should choose someone you trust, and that the person will need to have your access key and a copy of your death certificate. Tap on the Add Legacy Contact button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="86OtX9"&gt;You will be presented with a list of your contacts. Choose one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BP5Cg5"&gt;Again, a page will explain what info the contact will have access to. Tap on Continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your access key can be shared via message or print / PDF." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRH42kkkFepawmEQ89F6dthHzY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058295/IMG_86EF6F6C0BD0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your access key can be shared via message or print / PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If your contact is an iOS user, they can be messaged the access key." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fCQQEqvXgNaobHa4kVQoZUsXdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058296/IMG_8DF1D0ECCD4F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your contact is an iOS user, they can be messaged the access key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="LmabEL"&gt;You can now choose how to share you access key (which is a very long string of numbers and letters). If you message your chosen legacy contact with the access key &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; if they accept it, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; if they have iOS 15.2, the key will be stored in their Apple settings. Otherwise, you can print out a copy for them in hard copy or as a PDF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9r0gpE"&gt;Google Inactive Account Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TMOPg2"&gt;Google’s Inactive Account Manager is one of the more complete tools for taking care of your digital legacy — even if you’re just temporarily too ill to handle things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="exTeZc"&gt;Begin by going to the &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/u/2/inactive"&gt;Inactive Account Manager&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on Start. You’re going to go through three setups: when the inactive account manager will kick in, who to notify, and whether everything should be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s Inactive Account Manager offers a variety of options for what to do with your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdOdnUfXRKSvNvgpNbKwH-vLNJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058171/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_2.41.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Inactive Account Manager offers a variety of options for what to do with your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HDcEf0"&gt;First, you decide whether the manager should activate if your account is inactive for three, six, 12, or 18 months. You’re also asked to verify a phone number and / or one or more email accounts where you can be contacted. If you haven’t gone into the account, Google will then use the phone number or email addresses to contact you a month before your set time is up to make sure that you’re really no longer around (and haven’t simply forgotten you had that account). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can decide how long Google should wait before deciding you may no longer be around." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmCnRs6gjS6UnAfH84h_trS2LWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058235/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_2.46.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose how long Google should wait before deciding you may no longer be around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="T8eU9O"&gt;The next page lets you list up to ten people who should be notified by Google that your account hasn’t been used. For each person, you can specify exactly which apps they should have access to, ranging from your calendar and contacts to your Google account and purchases. You can also simply let them have access to all your apps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can specify what data can be shared with your legacy contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87g9LZWwcbouJWBvk6yWUiYHfUI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058236/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.15.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can specify what data can be shared with your legacy contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6M83ad"&gt;If you want, you can add their phone number so that Google can use it to verify their identity (and, rather eerily, you can include a personal message to send them). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OqrVrT"&gt;You can also activate a Gmail message to anyone who emails you after the manager kicks in, telling them that the account is no longer active. You can have the message sent to everyone who emails you or only to people in your contact list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you want, you can arrange to send a message in reply to emails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Le5XrUDdvkkPpitbrQ05mF98TYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058237/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.37.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want, you can arrange to send a message in reply to emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="jT7MjM"&gt;Lastly, you can arrange for your entire account to be deleted three months after it is declared inactive. This will also include, according to Google, any shared public data such as YouTube videos. (If you’ve named someone who will have access to your account, this will give them three months before the account is pulled to save anything they want to.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If requested, Google will delete your entire account after three months." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLPvWnHP3N7FswAng_iyl6yRdSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058241/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.38.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If requested, Google will delete your entire account after three months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZgPOL0"&gt;Finally, you’ll be given the chance to look over your plan and confirm that this is what you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6GMZRa"&gt;Facebook Memorialization Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NRpASA"&gt;Facebook calls its digital legacy feature Memorialization Settings. It’s similar to Google’s and Apple’s — it gives a chosen person access to your account after your death. The only difference is that, because Facebook is often used to memorialize people who have died, there are some extra things of which to be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="kdWY3s"&gt;To begin with, on the Facebook site, click on the downward arrow in the upper right corner, and go to Settings &amp;amp; Privacy &amp;gt; Settings. Make sure you’re in the General section (the first category in the left hand column) and select Memorialization Settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook lets you choose a friend to manage your account posthumously." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yPYh1ZeMBhnSPL83JlCTAIY9KQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058172/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.46.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook lets you choose a friend to manage your account posthumously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gCNkwr"&gt;The page will open up to explain that you can choose a legacy contact who will be able to manage tribute posts on your site, delete your site, accept new friends, and update your profile. The person you choose will be contacted by Facebook, so it’s probably a good idea to talk to them about it beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="abtQSz"&gt;You can also choose to have your account permanently deleted via a link at the bottom of that page. If you don’t choose that, then as soon as Facebook finds out you’re no longer alive, it will “memorialize” your account. That means that the word “Remembering” will be placed on your page, your content will remain, and friends can leave messages on the timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PXZYza"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yEkyHW"&gt;Twitter doesn’t provide any way to posthumously transfer your account to a family member or friend. Somebody who wants to close down the account of a deceased Twitter user will have to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/contact-twitter-about-a-deceased-family-members-account"&gt;fill out a form&lt;/a&gt; and then send in a pile of paperwork, including their own ID and a death certificate. They will not be allowed access to the account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter will let a survivor delete your account assuming they have the right paperwork." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdgO0tiShN0fogTSOkycuGwJ8A0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058247/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_11.48.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter will let a survivor delete your account assuming they have the right paperwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NyOTvr"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="19RHFA"&gt;Like Twitter, Instagram offers no way to plan ahead of time who will have access to your account or what they’ll do with it. Instead, &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/264154560391256/"&gt;the site will memorialize the account&lt;/a&gt; once it receives proof, such as a newspaper clipping or a death certificate. Family members can also request that an account be closed if they have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/1474899482730688"&gt;the proper proof&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fill out this form to turn someone’s Instagram account into a memorial." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGNpnlsWab57F7zAXn2YVg4sfT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058250/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_11.49.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fill out this form to turn someone’s Instagram account into a memorial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9qY3wa"&gt;As of this writing, there are no other social media sites that I know of that have any specific features for what happens when a user is no longer around. Instead, executors, family members, or others with legal standing will have to provide the paperwork needed to enable an account to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSaqgN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
