    <title>Wi-Fi’s biggest upgrade in decades is starting to arrive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TuRqRi"&gt;Wi-Fi is about to get a lot better. Many of this year’s new phones, laptops, TVs, routers, and more will come with support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, a new upgrade to Wi-Fi that’s essentially like expanding your wireless connection from a two-lane road to an eight-lane highway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;It’s the biggest upgrade to Wi-Fi in 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, and connections should be faster and a lot more reliable because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAaal3"&gt;The Wi-Fi Alliance, the industry-wide group that oversees Wi-Fi, is now starting to certify the first wave of products with support for Wi-Fi 6E. Phones, PCs, and laptops with support should start hitting the market in the first months of 2021, according to the IDC research group, and TVs and VR devices with support are expected to arrive by the middle of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xrTBBL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi 6E explained: Wi-Fi is getting its biggest upgrade in 20 years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PXv0kg"&gt;Some of the first devices are likely to be announced over the next week. During CES, which kicks off on January 11th, router companies will preview what they have coming up for the year. Samsung is also planning to announce its next flagship phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;the Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, and some if not all of them are likely to have support for Wi-Fi 6E thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;Snapdragon 888 processor&lt;/a&gt;. Because the chip includes support for it, Wi-Fi 6E should be present in many of this year’s top Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLEJgG"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E is such a big upgrade because it relies on a huge expansion of the wireless airwaves available to consumer devices. In April 2020, the Federal Communications Commission opened up this wide new swath of spectrum in the United States, but new hardware was required in order to make use of it. Nearly a year on, we’re finally starting to see devices with those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vfJf9W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oOZLhkaehzU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KziBaF"&gt;Existing Wi-Fi devices operate on two spectrum bands, 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Wi-Fi 6E adds a third — 6GHz — and there’s a lot more of it, quadrupling the total amount of airwaves used for typical Wi-Fi. That means you can have larger, higher-speed connections, and that airwaves are less likely to be congested. In an apartment building, for instance, your neighbors’ Wi-Fi networks might interfere with your own. But with Wi-Fi 6E, there’s a lot more bandwidth to go around, so there’s less of a chance that you’ll be fighting over the exact same airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeBSF5"&gt;It’ll be some time before most new devices are shipping with Wi-Fi 6E, though. Not all new gadget are even shipping with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;standard Wi-Fi 6 yet&lt;/a&gt;, and that version of Wi-Fi started rolling out about two years ago. By the start of 2022, IDC only expects 20 percent of shipping Wi-Fi 6 products to also support Wi-Fi 6E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnOmYV"&gt;Another hurdle is support from regulators worldwide. Though the US has approved use of 6GHz airwaves, communications regulators in other countries need to approve the spectrum for Wi-Fi use, too. The Wi-Fi Alliance says that the UK, EU, South Korea, Chile, and United Arab Emirates have all given a green light on allowing 6GHz usage for Wi-Fi, while regulators in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are among others where progress is being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWaBuV"&gt;“There is absolutely momentum, and it is building around making [6GHz] available for Wi-Fi,” Kevin Robinson, the Wi-Fi Alliance’s marketing leader, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz unveils its absolutely massive 56-inch ‘Hyperscreen’ display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68f6P9cNNvPmZtTs-NwZLWJq3f8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631835/21C0001_011.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9eSk2d"&gt;There are big infotainment displays. And then there’s Mercedes-Benz’s “Hyperscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27CEqf"&gt;The German automaker just unveiled a mammoth, pillar-to-pillar, 56-inch touchscreen that will debut in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504049/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-sedan-eqe-suv"&gt;EQS luxury electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The Hyperscreen is the centerpiece of the automaker’s second generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316700/mercedes-benz-mbux-second-generation-infotainment-system-touchscreen-hey-mercedes"&gt;MBUX infotainment system&lt;/a&gt; that eschews physical buttons in favor of a completely digital (and voice-controlled) in-car user experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm67M4"&gt;To be sure, the Hyperscreen isn’t one screen, but several displays embedded in one solid piece of curved glass that spans the entire dash. Based on early images, there appear to be at least three screens embedded in the display: an instrument cluster behind the steering column, a central infotainment screen, and an additional screen facing the front passenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wtsSdJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be sure, the Hyperscreen isn’t one screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qo1mul"&gt;The Hyperscreen will first appear in the EQS, a luxury electric sedan that Mercedes has said will go into production in late 2021. It will be powered by MBUX, which is short for “Mercedes-Benz User Experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965682/mercedes-a-class-mbux-voice-assistant"&gt;First introduced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, MBUX is one of the more capable automaker-created, voice-controlled infotainment systems on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ABQsU1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10270759"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xRfcMf"&gt;Mercedes says the Hyperscreen will include something called “zero layers,”  in which the user no longer has to scroll through a variety of sub-menus or give voice commands “as the most important applications are always available in a situational and contextual way at the top of the driver’s field of vision.” The automaker provided a couple of examples, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xLHA6h"&gt;If you always call one particular person on the way home on Tuesday evenings, you will be asked to make a corresponding call on that day of the week and that specific time of day. A business card appears with their contact information and – if it’s stored – their photo will appear. All MBUX suggestions are linked to the user’s profile. If someone else drives the EQS on a Tuesday evening, this recommendation would not be made – or another one is made, depending on the preferences of the other user.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="m2eHUP"&gt;The Hyperscreen will include a total of 12 actuators beneath the touch-sensitive surface for haptic feedback. Two coatings of the cover plate are said to reduce reflections and make cleaning easier. The curved glass itself consists of particularly scratch-resistant aluminum silicate. And analogue air vents are embedded in the surface at either end, offering an interesting blend of the digital and physical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q02gYB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;analogue air vents are embedded in the surface at either end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kbu0PG"&gt;The Hyperscreen won’t appear in a production car until the late 2021 release of the EQS, but the new version MBUX will see its debut in the new S-Class, which was first unveiled late last year. The updated infotainment system will let drivers save various preferences like seat settings, interior lighting color, favorite radio station, and more. These personal profiles can be enabled or disabled by using the new security features, or even loaded in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles. A fingerprint sensor in the main touchscreen and voice recognition will come standard, and there is a PIN setting as well. Buyers can opt for a version of the car with cameras that allow for facial recognition, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUACGf"&gt;Vehicle touchscreens have grown larger over the years, with some automakers assuming that bigger equals better. Among production vehicles, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126299/escalade-2021-oled-display-touchscreen-curved-glass"&gt;2021 Cadillac Escalade’s&lt;/a&gt; 14.2-inch screen is particularly noteworthy, as is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892836/ram-1500-carplay-android-auto-detroit-show-2018"&gt;2019 Ram 1500’s 12-inch screen&lt;/a&gt;. And the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; electric SUV is promising a mind-boggling 33-inch screen. The Tesla Model 3’s 15-inch screen, which floats above the dash rather than hugging the interior’s curves, has set the bar high for electric cars — one that Mercedes seems eager to vault over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKObOE"&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen how distracting to the driver all these screens will be. Without a robust driver monitoring system to ensure drivers stay focused on the road, these  ultra-large screens can be a huge liability and safety risk. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;A recent study by AAA found&lt;/a&gt; that many digital infotainment systems turning up in newer cars may be distracting enough to increase the risk for accidents, especially for older drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xGvPU"&gt;Mercedes says its zero layer feature will hopefully reduce driver distraction — though that will need to be proven out. “The goal was a concept without distraction of the driver or creating complicated operation,” Sajjad Khan, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz AG and CTO on the new MBUX generation, said in a press release. “We didn’t want to build the biggest screen ever in a car. Instead, we have developed special screens with a perfect ratio of size and functionality for maximum user-friendliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic made everyone familiar with a decades-old immigrant tradition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtQ7t0V3Yr6aWW1anulwQvGEPlw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631821/acastro_210105_4358_immigrantVirtualGatherings_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I grew up relying on technology to bring family together&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="axnCtG"&gt;The only thing that actually felt normal this holiday season was a video chat with my family on Christmas day. I logged on to a Facebook video call from New York City while my mom and brother called in from California. Aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, and nephews joined from more states across the US, the UK, Canada, Qatar, and the Philippines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="O1ptwF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Finding ways to reach out over long distances is nothing new, it’s what we do in a diaspora&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pqp5ll"&gt;The platforms we’ve used to keep this tradition going have changed over the past few decades. Way before Zoom became the lifeline for staying connected during the pandemic, immigrant families like mine have had to rely on whatever technology was available to stay in touch. Finding ways to reach out over long distances is nothing new, it’s what we do in a diaspora. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tP18En"&gt;This year, I found myself glued to the screen all Christmas morning marveling at how much taller my nieces, nephews, and god kids have gotten since the last time I saw them in person — which in most cases, has been years. I’ve mostly watched them grow up on screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igh2Nz"&gt;Before there were apps like Skype, it was even harder for us to connect. My dad moved to California from Manila not long after I was born to set up a life for us in America. Before my mom and I joined him, the only way my dad could see our faces was in photographs that my mom sent him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drib3N"&gt;“Daddy, just want to show you my complete set of teeth… and my dimple...” my mom scrawled on the back of a photo of two and a half-year-old me. Another copy of that picture would end up in my very first passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OsHSpt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Skype was a game changer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ky2gTl"&gt;Once the three of us, plus my American-born brother, were all stateside, there were expensive, hurried calls with relatives in the Philippines on our landline. Those calls triggered another frantic game of telephone. You needed to corral the household so that each person could have a moment on the call. “Hurry, tell so-and-so to pick up the phone,” whoever was holding the receiver yelled out. “It’s long distance!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JddI6"&gt;Skype was a game-changer when it started offering free video calling in 2006. I remember logging on from the desktop computer in my parents’ bedroom when I was visiting home from college. There, I’d see my grandma in the Philippines squinting to make out our faces in the blurry webcam picture. Before then, just hearing her voice was an expensive luxury. Suddenly, it was free — and I could look her in the eye while we chatted for as long as we wanted. By 2009, I had my own Skype account separate from my parents, and it seemed like all my cousins, aunts, and uncles did, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTRq4R"&gt;Now, I have an entire folder of apps on my phone that my family uses for free, long distance calls. There are so many platforms to choose from that each of our calls tends to start with the question of whether we’re using the right app: will switching over to Viber or Facebook offer a better signal or be easier for elders on the call to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sFK67"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Those calls have seamlessly melded into in-person events&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EMJCJ6"&gt;Those calls have seamlessly melded into in-person events, too. My mom’s side of the family has held a reunion on New Year’s Day every year since before my mom was born. We’re a big family (my mom alone has eight siblings), so this is a big production. My mom rarely gets to attend in person, but she calls in every year. The last time I attended the reunion, in the Philippines in 2014, my mom was still in California. I called her from my laptop and set her up on a table with a good view of the party. Other relatives abroad made their rounds on cellphones passed around by guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxI1fo"&gt;For the first time in more than 60 years, the reunion didn’t take place in person this year. I still found comfort in talking with my family over another video chat on New Year’s Day, but it doesn’t make me miss them any less. The heartache is still there when the holidays are over. It will be there when the pandemic ends. Going home isn’t always as easy as taking a plane ride when you’re an immigrant. There’s lots of red tape and luck involved when it comes to crossing borders. And there still isn’t an app that will let me reach out and kiss my mom on the cheek, or pick up my nieces and nephews before they get too old for me to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIk8l9"&gt;For me, sacrificing physical togetherness for the promise of more security in the future was part of growing up. And while technology can’t fully bridge the distance between family members, it has made that separation easier to bear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYi9lk"&gt;Video calls are now a standard way to connect with other family members who’ve fanned out around the world in search of a future with bigger possibilities. A staple of our family calls is help with finding work abroad and making a home for yourself in a new place. I’ve often heard it said that the Philippines’ biggest export is its own people. Its economy relies on over &lt;a href="https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/survey/labor-and-employment/survey-overseas-filipinos"&gt;2 million overseas workers, including a lot in health care&lt;/a&gt;, whose remittances make up about a tenth of the &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS?locations=PH"&gt;country’s GDP&lt;/a&gt;. The small archipelago nation is the world’s &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955369/"&gt;leading supplier of nurses&lt;/a&gt; — including my mom, lots of other relatives, and the &lt;a href="https://www.asianjournal.com/world/europe/filipina-nurse-administers-first-covid-19-vaccine-in-uk/"&gt;nurse in the UK&lt;/a&gt; who administered the world’s very first authorized vaccine against COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WOO2rv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sacrificing physical togetherness for the promise of more security in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HixswH"&gt;Searching for opportunities far from home, however, has come with costs. We’re perpetually missing our loved ones. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/philippines-sends-nurses-around-the-world-but-lacks-them-at-home"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt; of health care workers in the Philippines, and a &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-21/filipino-americans-dying-covid"&gt;disproportionately high number&lt;/a&gt; of Filipino Americans working on the frontlines of the pandemic have died from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3S9zz"&gt;A lot of people around the world sacrificed time with family and turned to virtual celebrations this holiday season to stop the spread of COVID-19. For that, I’m thankful, because it keeps my mom and other family members who work in health care safer. There are other immigrant essential workers who are more exposed to the virus and who have for years held up industries that take care of the sick and elderly and that bring food to our tables — perhaps at the expense of being with their family and friends during the holidays. A video call will never be as fulfilling as sitting in the same room with the people we love. But it’s more than what some of us have had in the past or have access to even now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="S1vwmG"&gt;The photos my mom sent my dad of me while we were still living in the Philippines are now neatly bound in a photo album. They’re a reminder that resourcefulness in immigrant communities has been about more than finding ways to get ahead. We’ve found ways to stay connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed4997"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJwXJl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok debuts first augmented reality filter that uses iPhone 12 Pro’s LIDAR camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DygVw3ARrSiEzfSckTBv7MAI6U8=/0x61:1140x821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631739/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_4.48.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhmZUR"&gt;TikTok has released its first augmented reality filter that can utilize the iPhone 12 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for an enhanced confetti effect that realistically settles on people or objects in your room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2G3MoC"&gt;The effect itself is just a somewhat belated 2021 ball drop (which feels like it would have been a lot more useful a few days ago.) But the ball drop filter is just the start, with TikTok promising to “develop more innovative effects in 2021.” And the fact that one of the most popular video platforms in the world is jumping onboard with support for one of the marquee features on Apple’s more pricey and premium smartphones is certainly notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2M5naX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To ring in 2021 we released our first AR effect on the new iPhone 12 Pro, using LiDAR technology which allows us to create effects that interact with your environment - visually bridging the digital and physical worlds. We're excited to develop more innovative effects in 2021! &lt;a href="https://t.co/6yFD2FfHta"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6yFD2FfHta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TikTokComms (@tiktok_comms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_comms/status/1346828242506969089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="tAnqPi"&gt;TikTok isn’t the only major company with eyes on Apple’s LIDAR tech. Snapchat, one of the other major players when it comes to augmented reality filters, already added support for Apple’s LIDAR sensor &lt;a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/news/create-lidar-powered-lenses-for-the-new-iphone-12-pro/"&gt;back in October&lt;/a&gt;, allowing creators to build their own enhanced AR filters for the app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam is getting expanded Xbox controller support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Elite Wireless Controller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbIAn2GfiZqIvxPpx81PAcTv6ds=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631540/xbox_3_correct.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GLB9PI"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/2919986982661995356"&gt;beta update for Steam&lt;/a&gt; has added new features for gamers using Xbox controllers. One of the more interesting additions is for Xbox Elite controller users, who can now use Valve’s software to bind the accessory’s rear paddles in controller configurations. The feature gives players more flexibility with how to use the extra inputs on the premium controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdDjxD"&gt;Other updates for Xbox controllers include the ability to bind the Series X gamepad’s share button in controller configurations, and the ability to use more than four Xbox controllers with Steam at a time. Support for trigger rumble has also been added for games using the Windows.Gaming.Input API. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZsCpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are also new features in store for PS5 controller users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pVBvQb"&gt;The Steam beta client also includes a new drop down menu for PS5 controller users, which lets them customize the controller’s LED. It can now be permanently enabled or disabled, or else enabled only when multiple controllers are connected. The update also adds support for the &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootingtwo"&gt;Wooting Two keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, which has features like analog key input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtUcUy"&gt;For now, these new features are only available in Steam’s beta client, which you can opt into by going into the Settings menu, selecting Account, and using the drop-down menu in the Beta participation section. The Xbox controller features will also need to be enabled in the General Controller Setting section of Steam’s settings, and require a driver to be installed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple celebrates the Year of the Ox with limited AirPods Pro in Asia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZAYDEQaWLHOnr3Xhm3MR9sUB6Q=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631509/app.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="reHh0q"&gt;February 12th marks the first day of Lunar New Year, with 2021 ushering in the Year of the Ox and saying farewell to the Year of the Rat. To celebrate, Apple is releasing limited edition AirPods Pro in certain Asian countries, with a case branded with a new version of the cow emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXbijB"&gt;Apple has also given an ox-themed makeover to its logo on some regional versions of its website:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOcnU-kbNPaBIotVqc7JfIuWLA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219378/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_17.17.28.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V4eMsW"&gt;The special edition AirPods Pro sell for the same price as the regular AirPods Pro, which is just as well considering you can order those with any text or emoji you want engraved on the case for free. They’re 1,999 yuan ($310) &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/shop/product/MJ533CH/A"&gt;in mainland China&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and they’re also for sale in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLV6w4"&gt;Apple is limiting orders to two per customer, and the AirPods Pro will only be available at retail Apple Stores as well as Apple’s local websites in each region. The Year of the Ox only comes around once every 12 years, though, so if you do buy these you may end up wanting to swap them out for a tiger-themed model in a year’s time — assuming Apple decides to release one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the 146 members of Congress who voted to support a conspiracy-fueled mob</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congress Holds Joint Session To Ratify 2020 Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OzFA6_Paoh0MwGGs8M8iXt5EpcU=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631455/1294949419.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V2AYte"&gt;On January 6th, 2021, President Donald Trump, the former reality television star of NBC’s &lt;em&gt;The Apprentice, &lt;/em&gt;escalated his assault on 244 years of democratic rule by inciting a mob of his supporters to break into the US Capitol building. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;In images&lt;/a&gt; that will haunt our republic for generations, Trump’s crazed supporters terrorized our elected representatives and their staffs and forced them to evacuate the seat of American government. &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-building-assault-4-dead-after-trump-supporters-storm-capitol/"&gt;CBS News reports&lt;/a&gt; that four people died in the ensuing chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8srHp8"&gt;Trump is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218009/trump-facebook-ban-block-posting-24-hours-capitol-riot"&gt;finally facing a ban from&lt;/a&gt; Facebook and Twitter. For more than four years he has polluted the internet, turning large swaths of our shared spaces into fever swamps of conspiracy and hatred. At best, platforms have temporarily limited his ability to post — at average, they have labeled his tweets with mild warnings about their accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8Cl8g"&gt;Of course, nobody with a rational bone in their body is confused about the intentions or character of the president. He began his presidential campaign with a racist diatribe, and has worked diligently since then to stoke partisan strife throughout the country. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/24/14561306/ban-donald-trump-twitter"&gt;I argued&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter ought to ban Trump as a form of direct action. And last June, after Trump ordered armed federal authorities to attack peaceful protesters in Washington, DC, I argued that platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21277579/ban-trump-violence-twitter-facebook"&gt;should ban both Trump and those in Congress&lt;/a&gt; who continued to enable his violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMiEff"&gt;It’s popular for some in the tech press to ascribe all of the evils of our present moment to the mechanisms of internet platforms. I understand the temptation. But Facebook and Twitter are not solely responsible for the president’s damage, nor that of his supporters. Still, it’s true that these platforms have immense and unprecedented power over human speech. And their rules often privilege those already in power. On Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms, Trump has so far been largely exempt from the restrictions placed on those who speak against him. Trump, after all, once said that he loves Twitter because it’s like owning a newspaper without any of the losses. He’s proven that the platforms we’ve praised for expanding speech can be hijacked to assault it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aKwhY"&gt;But what’s done is done. For now, I’ll accept the meager sense of relief provided by Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey in declaring that a physical attack on democracy is the line that can’t be crossed by an American president. Maybe they’ll revert to business as usual — but I hope they feel the same shock and fear millions of us felt on January 6th as we watched the inner sanctum of our democracy defiled by meme lords and pathetic insurrectionists dragging confederate flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KO4md1"&gt;But, ultimately, Zuckerberg and Dorsey aren’t elected officials. Powerful? Yes. Formally responsible to protect constitutional government? No. Those would be the members of Congress, who just days ago swore to protect the laws of the land. Incredibly, after returning to Congress through blood and shattered glass, 146 of these members voted to continue inflaming the misguided passions of those who have been deluded by internet conspiracy theories and other destructive lies. They voted to support the president’s lie that the election was stolen, even after the president directed his supporters to assault the Congress&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaMoeL"&gt;Here are their names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwqKXS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Update, January 7th, 3:25AM: &lt;/strong&gt;17 names have been added to the original list of 129 following a vote to object to the results of the Pennsylvania election.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKV7O9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States Senate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqyBTr"&gt;Josh Hawley (R-MO)&lt;br&gt;Ted Cruz (R-TX)&lt;br&gt;Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS)&lt;br&gt;Cynthia Lummis (R-WY)&lt;br&gt;Roger Marshall (R-KS)&lt;br&gt;Rick Scott (R-FL)&lt;br&gt;Tommy Tuberville (R-AL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cp1cDk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch deletes PogChamp emote because it’s now the face of ‘further violence’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhqKaMZlKrw85HrGMKbdTkWyLLI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630904/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mhwmJc"&gt;Twitch banned the popular PogChamp emote Wednesday after the person depicted in it published tweets “encouraging further violence” following a riot at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkALkQ"&gt;“We’ve made the decision to remove the PogChamp emote following statements from the face of the emote encouraging further violence after what took place in the Capitol today,” Twitch said in a statement Wednesday evening. “We want the sentiment and use of Pog to live on — its meaning is much bigger than the person depicted or image itself — and it has a big place in Twitch culture. However, we can’t in good conscience continue to enable use of the image.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nE3nsO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've made the decision to remove the PogChamp emote following statements from the face of the emote encouraging further violence after what took place in the Capitol today.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1347003152222937088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vMzT4k"&gt;The PogChamp emote is one of the oldest on Twitch and is widely used by viewers to display excitement in stream chats. PogChamp, or “poggers,” has become synonymous with gaming culture and streaming platforms like Twitch due to its popularity. “Poggers,” the shortened version of the emote, has taken off as a general meme expressing surprise over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9trSO9"&gt;Twitch’s decision to ban PogChamp was made after the face depicted in the emote, professional &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt; player Ryan “Gootecks” Gutierrez, published tweets Wednesday questioning whether more “civil unrest” would take place after a woman was shot at the Capitol. Earlier Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;pro-Trump protesters stormed&lt;/a&gt; the Capitol building, delaying a vote to certify the results of the 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXE9qz"&gt;“We will work with the community to design a new emote for the most hype moments on Twitch,” Twitch said on Twitter Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Instagram ban Trump for 24 hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8BI_MCKdBg_DkeBVfqpxy3g-f8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630678/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YfK6fi"&gt;Facebook has blocked President Trump from posting on the site for 24 hours, the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1346994037786619905"&gt;Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. The decision comes after the company already removed posts he made in support of the pro-Trump mob that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;attacked the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jP7qdn"&gt;“We’ve assessed two policy violations against President Trump’s Page which will result in a 24-hour feature block, meaning he will lose the ability to post on the platform during that time,” the statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwvDbu"&gt;Trump’s account on Facebook-owned Instagram will also be locked for 24 hours, Instagram head Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1346999536447795202"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SZs23P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've assessed two policy violations against President Trump's Page which will result in a 24-hour feature block, meaning he will lose the ability to post on the platform during that time.&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1346994037786619905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OlSeXy"&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;removed a video&lt;/a&gt; posted hours after the attack began where Trump called on protestors to “go home” and stated falsely that “we had an election that was stolen from us.” The company also removed a text post asking his supporters to “remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P7IMq"&gt;Twitter has also restricted Trump on its platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;locking his account&lt;/a&gt; for 12 hours after removing three tweets that the company said were “severe violations” of its policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElwHtg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Jan 7th, 9:05PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation of the lock on Trump’s Instagram account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s 2021 Gram laptops feature Intel’s 11th-Gen processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYP8bR75WX8_UONA02dG-LcaHok=/73x0:928x570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68630631/2021_LG_gram_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3xGBJN"&gt;LG has announced its 2021 lineup of Gram laptops, which feature a new design as well as some internal upgrades. There are five models. They include three clamshells (the Gram 17, the Gram 16, and the Gram 14) as well as two convertible models (the Gram 2-in-1 16 and the Gram 2-in-1 14). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU5l3X"&gt;LG hasn’t changed the Gram lineup’s signature features. LG Gram laptops are known for being astonishingly light (hence the name “Gram”). The Gram 17 is just 2.98 pounds, the same weight as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310392/lg-gram-17-review-display-weight-specs-price-features"&gt;its predecessor.&lt;/a&gt; It’s highly unusual to see a 17-inch laptop under three pounds, and using one really messes with your mind — I always felt like I was carrying nothing when holding the 2020 model, because I expected it to feel so much heavier. The Gram 16 is just 2.62 pounds, while the 14 is 2.2 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlydKh5vHtwyS99hN3AjtWRfhCE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218831/2021_LG_gram_17Z90P_Silver.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG&lt;/cite&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P2vKUI"&gt;Another great feature of the 2020 Gram 17, which has carried over to the 2021 model, was the 16:10 display. It offers more vertical space than a traditional 16:9 panel. In addition, LG says the new clamshell models have a new “four-sided slim bezel design” which achieves a screen-to-body ratio of 90 percent. As is evident from the photos LG provided, the bezels look pretty small, which gives the whole thing a nice modern vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7uqkq"&gt; LG also says the keyboard and touchpad have been enlarged “for comfort and efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RI0F4QwlFlcutPRv05DaT6ouUlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218827/2021_LG_gram_17Z90P_Black.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;LG&lt;/cite&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uCTOXN"&gt;The most significant upgrades are inside. All of the new Gram laptops have Intel’s 11th-Gen Core processors and can come with Iris Xe graphics or UHD graphics. All of the models are also certified through Intel’s Evo program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall"&gt;which is an Intel badge&lt;/a&gt; meant to certify the laptop can get at least nine hours of battery life, wake from sleep quickly, and other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XC1Kn8"&gt;LG claims you could see up to 19.5 hours from the Gram 17, Gram 16, and 16 2-in-1. That’s a claim I’d usually be skeptical of, but I will say the 2020 Gram 17 had some of the longest battery life I saw from a laptop last year. It lasted around 10 hours of my daily workload (which is fairly intense). So LG knows what it’s doing when it comes to efficiency, and there’s reason for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwLs_363qy7biMPV0IOMniJ7shQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22218833/2021_LG_gram_17Z90P_White.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYMraU"&gt;“Synonymous with unprecedented portability and first-class performance, the LG gram brand continues to raise the bar for the ultra-lightweight and slim laptop market,” said Jang Ik-hwan, LG senior vice president and head of the company’s IT business unit, in a statement. “With sleeker, more refined designs and 16:10 aspect ratio displays while maintaining their light weight, our latest LG gram lineup gives consumers the ability to enjoy better productivity and more immersive viewing experiences wherever they go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVRapV"&gt;Pricing and availability are still to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
