    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Intel delivers a speed boost and PCIe 4.0&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EnDGaS"&gt;I built a new gaming PC in September to play new games like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. I figured that picking Intel’s Core i9-10900K and Nvidia’s RTX 3090 would make this machine last for years and offer top tier performance in demanding titles like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. I was wrong. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a notorious beast of a game and is quickly becoming the new &lt;em&gt;Crysis &lt;/em&gt;test for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKZ5ER"&gt;It has struggled to run smoothly above 30fps with all settings maxed out at 1440p on my PC, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;AMD’s Intel-beating Ryzen 9 5950X&lt;/a&gt; only improved the situation slightly for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aEXza"&gt;Intel’s latest 11th Gen processor arrives with a big promise of up to 19 percent IPC (instructions per cycle) improvements over the existing i9-10900K, and more specifically the lure of 14 percent more performance at 1080p in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; with high settings. This piqued my curiosity, so I’ve been testing the i9-11900K over the past few days to see what it can offer for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UzxkC"&gt;It’s less than a year after the i9-10900K release, and I’m already considering upgrading to Intel’s new i9-11900K because I’ve found it boosts &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4td3oPFclFVU8HrC0dgiUwB_8_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407556/intelcorei9_11900K_2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fl32l2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t typically review processors, so we don’t own dedicated hardware testing rigs or multiple CPUs and systems to offer all of the benchmarks and comparisons you’d typically find in CPU reviews. For those, we’re going to recommend you visit the excellent folks at &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/leo-waldock/intel-core-i9-11900k-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JW6ezT"&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-11900K ships with eight cores, 16 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz. On paper, that sounds like it would be less powerful than the 10900K with its 10 cores, 20 threads, and boosted clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, but the reality is far more complicated thanks to how games and apps are designed. Most of &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; currently runs in a main thread that’s often limited by how well your CPU can run single-threaded applications and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jhmwDG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10419674"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNPoqR"&gt;So in recent years Intel has managed to stay on top with its single-threaded performance, despite AMD offering more cores. That was until AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X managed to beat the final Intel performance advantage late last year. Intel’s new 11th Gen chips are trying to reclaim its traditional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1CgKD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is a good example of where Intel typically has an advantage. It’s also an increasingly rare example of a game that’s very sensitive to your entire system components and not just how good your GPU is at rendering games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aDPhrmvWPvKMfg19eXP2K3EY4eA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407557/705ff7fe_2f40_4e85_a2fd_b17a854aee38.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;em&gt; is a demanding title on PC.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="L89LfM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10419610"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4YXju"&gt;Intel’s Core i9-11900K does its job well enough here to boost performance by around 20 percent depending on resolution. I’ve tested a variety of flights taking off from different airports and flying over some of the world’s most beautiful locations and the most demanding cities the game has to offer. Everything feels smoother with Intel’s latest chips, but the results aren’t dramatic enough to get me beyond 60fps without stepping some settings down. A flight over Seattle with all the settings maxed out shows a 24-percent performance improvement with the new 11th Gen Core i9 at 1080p and an 18-percent increase at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Loo0e0"&gt;On my i9-10900K PC, I saw average frame rates of 38fps at 1440p and 33fps at 1080p. The Core i9-11900K managed to bump these to 45fps average at 1440p and 41fps average at 1080p. Averages during a particular benchmark don’t always tell the whole story, though. Over the hours I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve noticed the game dip and stutter less than before. It’s still not perfect, but it’s certainly smoother overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQb8jl"&gt;If I dial the game back to high settings, it immediately jumps to a 66fps average at 1440p — demonstrating just how much the ultra settings hit frame rates. I can personally barely notice the difference between high and ultra settings in &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;so the boost here is noticeable thanks to the smoother gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAxDG"&gt;I also tested &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;and the Cinebench R23 and Geekbench 5 benchmarks. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; saw a tiny bump of around 3 percent at both 1080p and 1440p, while the i9-11900K managed some impressive single core performance gains in both Cinebench and Geekbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xOQgPv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10419602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ8W7P"&gt;I should note I was also hoping to do most of my testing with my existing Z490 motherboard, but that didn’t go to plan. I swapped the chip in with the latest BIOS update for 11th Gen processors and found that the system rebooted a few minutes into games without even a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). I wasn’t able to troubleshoot it fully in time for review, but the Asus Maximus XIII Hero (Z590) board supplied by Intel worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXgm4G"&gt;You should be able to easily use 11th Gen processors with Z490 motherboards, as most manufacturers have already issued BIOS updates to support Intel’s latest processors. Some will even support M.2 NVMe storage using PCIe 4.0 with these latest chips, while others like Asus only support PCIe 4.0 on the Primary PCIe x16 slot with 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ywp8M4"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen processors finally deliver PCIe 4.0 support, and that’s good news for storage. Manufacturers have started to fully support PCIe 4.0 drives in recent months, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507807/western-digital-wd-first-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssds-sn850"&gt;Western Digital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21444428/samsung-pc-980-pro-ssd-solid-state-drive-storage-price"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, GigaByte, and MSI all launching high-speed drives. If you have a compatible PCIe 4.0 NVMe drive, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will certainly be worth it. I’ve managed read speeds of 6729MB/s and write speeds of 5206MB/s using Western Digital’s new SN850 1TB drive. Corsair’s MP600 also manages 4987MB/s read and 4259MB/s write speeds. Using Intel’s older 10th Gen chip, the Corsair drive managed 3484MB/s reads and 3235MB/s writes, so an 11th Gen upgrade improved speeds by more than 40 percent. If you work with a lot of files every day, the upgrade to 11th Gen processors will be worth it for PCIe 4.0 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JD0BzaEMSVfes6_0gQATqsY1B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407569/xF0EPe6.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s SN850 has super fast PCIe 4.0 speeds with Intel’s 11th Gen processors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="12kbsp"&gt;I don’t think the Core i9-11900K does enough for me personally to upgrade from a 10900K, but the PCIe 4.0 support would tempt me more if I needed the speeds there. At $550 (if you can find it at this retail price), the Core i9-11900K sits in between AMD’s offerings, being less expensive than the top 5950X and 5900X Ryzen 9 chips and $90 more than the 5800X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9HgZj"&gt;There’s some solid single-thread performance here, and the 11900K and AMD’s 5900X and 5950X all trade blows depending on the games. Intel’s performance improvement will come at a cost of energy efficiency, though. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-core-i9-11900k-and-i5-11600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that the 11900K “sets the new high power mark” in several of its power tests, drawing over 200 watts in the same test that AMD’s Ryzen 9 5900X drew 116 watts. If you even need a new CPU, it’s worth considering just how much Intel’s latest chips will influence your energy bills and the games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWfCyt"&gt;Whether you decide to upgrade to Intel’s 11th Gen or one of AMD’s chips will probably depend on the games you play and stock availability. A lot of games do a bad job of utilizing multiple cores on CPUs, mostly because console gaming hardware hasn’t offered solid CPU performance and spreading multiple rendering and physics threads across different cores can complicate game design. Intel’s new chips do a better job of handling these single threads to improve performance, but it’s very game-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCEapG"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, the general consensus is that the game desperately needs to be moved to DirectX 12 for improvements to multi-core CPU performance. But Intel’s IPC improvements have managed to help until the Direct X 12 update arrives with the Xbox Series X release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF8rmK"&gt;Where Intel might have an advantage over AMD here is availability of chips. It has been increasingly difficult to find AMD’s latest Ryzen processors in recent months, thanks to a global chip shortage. Intel partners have already been accidentally selling some 11th Gen desktop CPUs, which may indicate it will have a steadier supply in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="p7mm3d"&gt;The winner between Intel and AMD will be the company that can get these chips into the hands of PC gamers eager to upgrade. Much like the GPU market right now, benchmarks don’t matter when the best chip is often the only one you can actually buy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo and Aurora team up on fully autonomous trucks for North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlp-AJbU554P6qwA9s7J3QVRRKg=/105x0:1155x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047931/Volvo_Blog_Cover_1260x700__Rendering_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FZ20LC"&gt;Volvo is partnering with self-driving startup Aurora on a new lineup of fully autonomous semi trucks, the companies announced. The trucks will be deployed in North America on highly frequented hub-to-hub routes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv07Rk"&gt;The deal between Volvo Autonomous Solutions and Aurora — which was founded by former executives from Google, Tesla, and Uber — is a “long-term partnership spanning several years,” the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E1pOuy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“long-term partnership spanning several years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dke6G2"&gt;It’s also the latest partnership between a major OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and an autonomous technology startup, as the industry continues to slowly inch toward a future with more fully driverless passenger vehicles and trucks on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vV8jKv"&gt;Aurora has been testing its “Aurora Driver” hardware and software stack in its test &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331418/aurora-self-driving-cars-semi-truck-av-texas-robotaxi"&gt;fleet of minivans and Class 8 trucks in the Dallas-Fort Worth area&lt;/a&gt; since last year. Unlike its rivals, which are largely focused on robotaxi applications, the company has said that its first commercial service will be in trucking “where the market is largest today, the unit economics are best, and the level of service requirements is most accommodating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrIYdA"&gt;“Creating a viable autonomous on-highway offering requires close partnerships with both customers and tech partners to develop the needed capabilities,” says Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, in a statement. “This exciting partnership brings our goal of transport as a service an important step closer and will accelerate our commercial offer for hub-to-hub applications in North America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJYEz3"&gt;To date, Aurora has raised $690 million in funding, and co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson has been hailed as the &lt;a href="https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-aurora-a-safe-path-to-scale-autonomous-vehicles-bd0680fa4fe0"&gt;“Henry Ford of autonomous vehicles,”&lt;/a&gt; thanks to his work helping to pioneer Google’s self-driving car initiative. His co-founders are Sterling Anderson, who helped lead Tesla’s Model X project, and Drew Bagnell, who ran a research lab at Carnegie Mellon then left to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber. Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai, and EV startup &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/09/aurora-will-power-byton-evs-autonomous-driving-features/"&gt;Byton&lt;/a&gt; are also Aurora customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE0qcl"&gt;The company raised half a billion dollars last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215575/amazon-innovation-self-driving-car-startup-google-tesla-executives"&gt;in a funding round led by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;It also acquired Uber’s autonomous division&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274640/toyota-aurora-denso-self-driving-car-robotaxi"&gt;teamed up with Toyota and Denso&lt;/a&gt; to develop a fleet of robotaxis, with the first hitting the road by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COZdPd"&gt;Volvo, which is the second largest manufacturer of heavy duty semi trucks, has been gradually adding more partially autonomous features in its trucks but has yet to strike a deal to build fully driverless delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHg0Fz"&gt;Long-haul trucking is likely to be one of the first broad applications of automated driving technologies. Indeed, there are widespread fears in the trucking industry that autonomous technology will lead to enormous displacement among truck drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSX7Le"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/managing-transition-driverless-road-freight-transport"&gt;A 2017 study&lt;/a&gt; found that automated trucks could reduce the demand for drivers by as much as 50 to 70 percent in the US and Europe by 2030, with 4.4 million of the 6.4 million professional drivers on both continents rendered obsolete. These fears are heightened as tech companies introduce eye-catching, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923232/einride-tpod-self-driving-truck-sweden-logan"&gt;cabin-less prototypes&lt;/a&gt; designed to cut the driver completely out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJFOAM"&gt;There’s been a flurry of partnerships and other corporate deals in recent years in the nascent driverless trucking industry, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic casts doubt on the long-term viability of using autonomous vehicles for passenger transportation. Established players like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt;Daimler said they would be joining forces with Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, while newcomers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310209/tusimple-self-driving-truck-network-ups-xpress-penske"&gt;TuSimple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/self-driving-truck-startup-ike-raises-52-million/"&gt;Ike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2019/09/25/self-driving-startup-embark-raises-70-million-opens-freight-hubs-for-robot-big-rigs/"&gt;Embark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/plusai-autonomous-truck-completes-coast-to-coast-delivery-in-3-days/568729/"&gt;Plus.ai&lt;/a&gt; are also working toward fully driverless trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s latest Starship landing attempt ends in destruction</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the last visuals from SpaceX’s SN11 before it exploded. | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKsTXN"&gt;Another Starship prototype exploded Tuesday morning during an attempt to nail a tricky landing technique at SpaceX’s test launch facilities in Texas. The landing attempt followed a clean liftoff and a demonstration of the rocket’s autonomous in-flight maneuvers, marking SpaceX’s fourth high-altitude flight since December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2NXnH"&gt;The SN11 rocket launched at 9AM ET in foggy weather at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities, soaring roughly 6.2 miles in the company’s fourth high-altitude test flight. Like past prototype tests, SN11 demonstrated a clean firing of three Raptor engines and autonomous control of the aerodynamic flaps that steer its descent back to land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dpcm92"&gt;A live camera feed aboard SN11 froze moments before its landing attempt. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDL-ZMRHYrE"&gt;Another feed&lt;/a&gt;, provided by the website NASA Spaceflight, showed large chunks of debris raining on SpaceX’s Boca Chica facilities, though the landing explosion itself was obscured by fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntGXpJ"&gt;“Looks like we had another exciting test,” SpaceX’s John Insprucker said on SpaceX’s live stream, suggesting the vehicle was lost in another eventful landing attempt. “We do appear to have lost all the data from the vehicle, and the team of course is away from the landing pad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JTKHCN"&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021 announced as online-only event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4iHHOJmM_ffEj6TupX83HJTEmo=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047863/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9obnno"&gt;Apple just announced that its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will take place on June 7th through June 11th this year, and that like last year it will be an online-only event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDK3Ak"&gt;The announcement, as is typical for Apple, is opaque when it comes to details, but there might be a tantalizing hint: is the memoji character’s glasses simply showing a reflection from their laptop? Or could Apple finally be gearing up to announce its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;long-rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt; or AR glasses?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPkLeT"&gt;“We are working to make WWDC21 our biggest and best yet, and are excited to offer Apple developers new tools to support them as they create apps that change the way we live, work, and play,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of worldwide developer relations, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PHK6V"&gt;WWDC is when Apple typically details changes coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS with the occasional hardware surprise. Last year, it also dedicated a significant portion of its keynote to announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;Mac lineup’s transition to its own Apple Silicon&lt;/a&gt; processors. With this transition still underway, it seems likely that Apple will have an update to share about its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz8B8y"&gt;New hardware tends to be less of a focus at the developer conference, but it’s not unheard of. Apple used WWDC 2019 as its venue to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646424/apple-mac-pro-redesign-new-specs-features-photos-wwdc-2019"&gt;announce the new Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and at WWDC 2017 it announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732144/apple-homepod-speaker-announced-siri-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;HomePod smart speaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/5/15740298/new-apple-imacs-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;updated iMac desktops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732350/new-apple-ipad-announced-price-release-date-wwdc-2017"&gt;a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxhVo"&gt;It’s not surprising that Apple has opted to make its global conference for developers online-only given that the impact of COVID-19 is still being felt around the world. Facebook’s F8 developer conference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346432/facebook-f8-conference-2021-date-virtual-event-sign-up"&gt;will be virtual this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con and the 2021 Anime Expo&lt;/a&gt; have also confirmed that their physical events will not take place. But some organizations are attempting to make limited physical events happen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;like Mobile World Congress in Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQvr7t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPUrEP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flying taxi startup Lilium goes public via SPAC, unveils its new electric aircraft </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/soVYzhQkIbfTDxBXy5-YwvC8Z_E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047853/lilium_jet_7_seat_render_04.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4twj9d"&gt;Germany’s Lilium will be the latest electric aviation startup to go public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. Lilium will merge with Qell Acquisition, a SPAC founded by former General Motors executive Barry Engle. The newly formed company will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LILM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZOUex"&gt;As part of the announcement, Lilium unveiled a new, seven-seat electric aircraft that it says will launch as part of an inter-city flying taxi service in 2025. Previously, the company’s prototype was said to have only five seats — so we can assume that Lilium’s ambitions to ferry more passengers are growing along with its financial expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWLPsM"&gt;It’s the latest deal involving an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startup after the SPAC deals of &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/archer-to-go-public-through-merger-deal-with-spac-atlas-crest-receives-1-billion-order-from-united-airlines-2021-02-10"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;Joby Aviation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;A SPAC is a blank-check corporation&lt;/a&gt;, formed as an alternative to an IPO, because it raises funds for an operation that doesn’t have revenue of its own. There have been a rash of SPAC deals involving companies in the transportation space, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/car-sensor-startup-aeye-goes-public-in-2-billion-spac-deal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/micro-mobility-startup-helbiz-to-go-public-via-a-spac-and-will-expand-into-ghost-kitchens/"&gt;micromobility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p4epoW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the latest deal involving an electric vertical takeoff and landing startup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7atVeS"&gt;Lilium’s SPAC deal values the combined company at a pro forma enterprise value of $2.4 billion and an approximately $3.3 billion pro forma equity value. After the merger is finalized, Lilium is expected to receive approximately $830 million from the deal, including $450 million from a fully committed common stock PIPE offering and $380 million cash held in trust. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, at which point the company will start trading on the Nasdaq exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkK3z6"&gt;Engle, a longtime executive vice president and president of GM’s North America division, will join the board of the newly formed company, as well as former Airbus CEO Tom Enders. Engle described Lilium’s product as “a highly engineered aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKHkRX"&gt;The type of aircraft Lilium is developing is typically called a “flying car,” electric-powered, able to carry only a handful of passengers, and intended for short flights within a city or regionally. These types of vehicles are still in their prototype phase and have yet to be rolled out for commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAuIUF"&gt;The company completed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18625088/lilium-jet-test-flight-electric-aircraft-flying-car"&gt;first phase of testing&lt;/a&gt; of its five-seater 36-rotor electric prototype in October 2019, with the aircraft hitting speeds of 100km/h (62mph). Lilium says it remains “on track” to launch passenger operations in several locations around the world by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hlUSdd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new seven-seater jet has a projected cruise speed of 175mph&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UeWrd"&gt;The new seven-seater jet has a projected cruise speed of 175mph at 10,000 feet and a range of 155 miles. That’s slower and with less range than the company’s projections for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18625088/lilium-jet-test-flight-electric-aircraft-flying-car"&gt;five-seater jet&lt;/a&gt;, which Lilium said would have a top speed of 186mph and a range of 186 miles. Still, the company says it is the “culmination of five years of technology development across four generations of technology demonstrators, including Lilium’s full-scale 5-Seater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIxKeF"&gt;Lilium applied for certification with the US Federal Aviation Administration in 2018, which typically can take several years to complete. The company has also applied with Europe’s EASA for certification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evaJTe"&gt;Of course, many companies — Lilium included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, had to reorganize &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/12/01/inside-larry-pages-kitty-hawk-returned-deposits-battery-fires-boeing-cora/#c6e934858ab4"&gt;amid reports&lt;/a&gt; about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits. Another startup, Zunum, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612702/zunum-aero-sues-boeing-fraud-hybrid-electric-jet"&gt;locked in a bitter legal fight&lt;/a&gt; with its former investor, Boeing. And last year, Germany’s Lilium Jet had a &lt;a href="https://evtol.com/news/lilium-evtol-catches-fire/"&gt;prototype catch fire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RWoOQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXK6g1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poshmark’s Tracy Sun on why community is the future of retail   </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The resale app’s co-founder on stitching e-commerce with social media&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JmyIDi"&gt;E-commerce has seen a huge wave of growth during the pandemic, and my guest on today’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; has gained experience riding this wave. Tracy Sun is the co-founder and SVP of new markets at Poshmark, a fashion resale company that just went public earlier this year. The Poshmark app is a different kind of riff on e-commerce, though — it’s part catalog, part social network, and part creator platform. It competes with similar apps like Depop and Etsy, but also things like Instagram and eBay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVTlI5"&gt;All of that means Poshmark has a unique set of challenges: Tracy has to manage regular e-commerce issues like shipping logistics and customer service, as well as influencer economy problems like burnout and the incessant need to grow follower counts. Not to mention the universe of problems that come with selling fashion, like dealing with fashion labels. But if Poshmark can get it all right, Tracy thinks community is the future of retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5f0oA"&gt;Tracy Sun, co-founder and SVP of new markets at Poshmark. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/here/710"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h9bZHi"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5032085775" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bBeekc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVt7jf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy Sun, you are the co-founder and SVP of new markets at Poshmark. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in2bID"&gt;Thanks. I’m so happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqfhDe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really excited to talk to you. Poshmark is really interesting. It’s a shopping app with a really strong social element. It has basically a social network embedded into it. Explain what it is and how it works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okxo9A"&gt;Sure. So it is a bit of a different experience. Poshmark is a social marketplace, which combines the human connection of a physical shopping experience with the scale, reach, ease, and selection benefits of e-commerce. If you think about it, shopping has been around for a very long time. And if you think back to the markets and more recently, malls, and more recently, no more malls — people just like to connect, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok2jyp"&gt;You go to the local farmer’s market and you like to know who grows your lettuce, or you like to speak to the shopkeeper at a store, to find out how to style things. And with the rise of e-commerce, what’s happened is a lot of that human connection gets stripped out. And what you get is just, like I said, ease, selection, all that stuff. But what Poshmark does is it brings back a lot of that really innate human connection that happens around shopping and combines it with e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ21OR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That human connection in your app is, it’s people, right? You sign up for Poshmark, you open the app, you follow some brands, that’s the first prompt, but really you’re following people. There are strong echoes of Instagram in this entire experience, right? Is that the main focus for you, is you’re going to follow actual people on the app?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67Gc7l"&gt;You follow people as a means for discovery, as a means for connection. So what we see on Poshmark is people are on the app 27 minutes a day, and that’s not an engagement stat that you typically see in commerce. It’s an engagement level you see when there’s more things to see, more people to talk to, content’s changing, there are conversations going on. That’s the level of engagement we really see today. And that’s what’s happening on Poshmark. People come, they look at their feed, they talk to people who are selling things, asking them questions like, where did you get that? How do I pair that skirt with a pair of shoes? How does this fit? There’s a whole bunch of conversations going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yf6Rdl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That 27 minutes, is that the mean or the median? Because it feels like you probably have some sellers who are on there eight to 10 hours a day, and then people like me that bang through all their social apps for 30 seconds before they go to bed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngoqYv"&gt;Sure. That 27 minutes is an average of everyone who’s active on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E7h0s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the interesting problems for all social apps that I always think about is the flywheel of getting started. So you started Poshmark in 2011, now you’re a public company, you just IPO’d in January. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NGMYJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How’d you get the flywheel started, right? You’re asking people to sell products, to spend money, to put things in boxes and ship them. That’s a lot more than a TikTok or a Clubhouse or Instagram. You’re asking a lot of users, how’d you get the flywheel of engagement started?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8VXxE"&gt;That’s such a good question, and I actually remember back in 2010, Manish [Chandra] and I — Manish is a co-founder — I sat there and I asked him, “Do we get buyers first, do we get sellers first, do we get inventory?” because in 2010, not only were there not social marketplaces, people did not embrace reselling on a mass scale yet. So in addition to flywheel, we had to convince everyday people that you really do have items in your closet you can sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VLyFER"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TkKSWs"&gt;So, what we ended up doing is inadvertently going after all three at once. We met people, so not buyers, not sellers, not people with inventory, but just people who we thought would want to connect over commerce, and these are everyday people. So people that you feel like you could walk down the street and see them on the street. We went and talked to some fashion bloggers who were not shy to take photos of themselves because again, Instagram had not really become big yet. So the idea of a selfie was not in our lexicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxSrnA"&gt;So we really found just digitally savvy, fashion-loving people who loved to get together and talk about style. And we actually had physical events that brought them together. And during these physical events, we taught them how to use the app. And they really, really took off and started making it their own. And so what we found, to answer your question about flywheel, is these people became buyers, they became sellers, and they switch back and forth. And so what we focused on is really recruiting people and the flywheel took care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufwMfX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting, because you run a commerce platform, but the dynamics you’re describing, they’re the same dynamics as every social platform with creators. And I think that’s one of the more interesting tensions with every company that has creators on it. You have to service the creators, but you also have to make a great user experience. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMz9R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have many more people who are just consumers, but if you don’t have the creators, if you don’t have the sellers, you won’t have the buyers. Who do you think of as the more important cohort of users? Who do you spend your time thinking about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHy2mP"&gt;We typically spend most of our time thinking about our sellers because they, as you call them, they are the creators and we’ve focused our product strategy on helping the sellers become more and more successful. So we’re always thinking about, what are additional tools we can give them, to further engage their buyers? So in a way, we do focus on buyers as well, but through the lens of our sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fukQJQ"&gt;An example of that is we recently launched a feature called “Dropping Soon.” And what that does is it enables sellers to notify interested parties and say, “Hey, I have this special product and it will drop tomorrow at 9AM”. And our buyers love that. So they get notified, they’re so excited. They like the item in order to receive this notification. They wait for the drop to happen. The drop happens, our seller can schedule it. It fans out to everyone who has signed up to be notified and then buyers come in and then they purchase and have a great time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKI8Lt"&gt;So this tool, we built it for sellers, but the sellers are using it to engage with their buyers, and that’s the approach we’ve taken for so much of the product strategy at Poshmark, we enable people, and the people that we’re enabling are our sellers, and then our sellers go and talk to our buyers through our tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qe7jKl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things I think is really interesting about that approach is you’re talking about your sellers, your creators on your platform, is like primary users of your platform, people who are, they call themselves “Poshers,” right, which is really a great word. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhNisk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other platforms like Depop, I see a lot of TikTok stars who are just selling some stuff over on the side on Depop, and they’re using that platform to monetize their main platform. How do you think about that relationship to Instagram and TikTok, all these places where there are other kinds of influencers who are looking for alternate revenue streams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svHg22"&gt;I think everything is converging. The idea of the rise of creators and creator economy — Instagram, TikTok — what we’re entering into is an era where content is easily created and accessible, and you don’t have to be what we used to call influencers, who have millions and millions of followers. You can be a creator and be a star in your own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewkuCa"&gt;So I do think worlds are colliding, and it’s a really interesting time where people are just creating a lot of content. And we’re seeing that in Poshmark, where the idea of creating a closet and putting it up for sale, that was something 10 years ago people only did if they wanted to make a career out of it. And what we’re seeing now is it’s now very easy through Poshmark to come in, and within a few minutes, you can have something up for sale, make 20 bucks, go on with your life, and come back whenever you’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYMwyi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you actively out there recruiting influencers on other platforms, creators on other platforms, to use Poshmark as a secondary revenue stream or even a primary revenue stream?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ds4K3"&gt;We do have a lot of creators on Poshmark and most of them are coming in through organic means. We’re creating more and more tools to help people express themselves in this way. So for example, last year we launched our short-form video called “Posh Stories.” And what it enables anyone to do on Poshmark, is really tell a story behind something you’re selling or in your closet or your inspiration. And that was received really well by our community because as you know, video is just so much more vibrant and so much easier to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtZyGl"&gt;And then just last week, we added to that product by launching listing videos. So now, as a seller, you can add a video product to every single item in your closet, but even more interesting as a consumer, you can just consume a stream of just what people are selling, they’re styling it, they’re telling you how to wear it, what it looks like. So it’s a really well-received engagement mechanism that is being consumed by both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFTlsz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said everything is converging, and as you’re describing your new features, the app that converges the most things into itself is Instagram, right? Any kind of interaction you can have in a social platform, Instagram either already has, or is rapidly copying. Is Instagram your biggest competition or is Depop your biggest competition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHXKCD"&gt;Wherever people are spending their time is where we focus on, right? Because for us, we really want to help our sellers be successful and really engage them. So we want to build as many of those engagement tools as possible, so that they can stay on Poshmark and achieve as much of the social needs, as well as commerce needs, as they want. So we’re just heads-down, just focused on building out our social marketplace, and making sure that we really serve our sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITDmAO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, but let me push you on that. Instagram has shopping tools. They want people to spend money in there. Every time &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve talked to Adam Mosseri&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, I ask him why he won’t just take my credit card and turn [Instagram] into a catalog. Is that the biggest threat or is it a more head-up competitor like Depop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8oGyu"&gt;Well, let me tell you what our competitive advantage is. We built Poshmark grounds-up with commerce in mind. So when we say it’s a social marketplace, I don’t think all social features are equal. This is something that we thought about a lot in the early days of building Poshmark is you have to laser-focus on innovation, and you can’t just take innovation elsewhere and plop it onto a new customer without really understanding your customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8Pvia"&gt;So where we really focus is not just social, but how does social enable and unlock commerce. And so for us, nouns that we see elsewhere, like video or like follow. These are very standard social actions. On Poshmark, there’s always commerce intent behind them. So you’re pushing at competition, sure, you can shop on Instagram, you can shop on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/amazon/7"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can shop at your physical boutiques on Main Street when they start to open, there’s many places to shop, and there are many places to spend your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIFgcu"&gt;It used to be more TV, now it’s more online and TikTok. There’s many places to shop and spend time online. There’s very few places where you can socially engage and have every engagement point you do translate into a better shopping experience for you. And that’s where, yes, if you decompose Poshmark into pieces, we’re not inventing shopping, but everything you do, it changes your experience on Poshmark. So it’s like you have this virtual mall that’s ever-changing, and that’s what we’re focused on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpRFnC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this brings me to the question that I ask almost every co-founder and executive that comes on the show. This is a 10-year journey. You’re now a public company. You have this huge competition. You were talking about your focus. What is your decision-making framework, as you think about ways to expand Poshmark, you’re in charge of new markets. How has that decision-making changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S98E7l"&gt;It’s been a really interesting journey for me to go from being a really, really small founding team to now being an executive at a public company. I have never gone through that career journey before, just seeing a company evolve. And I love this question because, it’s really true, that decision-making, I might’ve said it gets more complicated as you get bigger, but now that I reflect on your question, I don’t think it gets more complicated, I think the inputs just change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Izg2p"&gt;So let me give you an example. In the early days, when there’s a handful of people, you just assume that everybody has the same amount of information, the same amount of context. Because it’s a startup and you’re an entrepreneur, and it’s like find product market fit or die, your north star is so focused. And there’s energy and adrenaline to getting there as a team together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT8x2Q"&gt;The urgency is so clear. And so all of that context enables really fast decision-making. A small number of people, everyone has the same amount of information, the urgency is extremely high, so you can’t really sit and contemplate it for a very long time. And so innately that small team makes the decision-making in a fast, urgent way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWVRwH"&gt;What I see now when we’ve got many, many stakeholders, many more than the early days, is now you have to really intentionally ask yourself, when you’re making a decision, who can help you based on the information they have? Do they have the context to help make the decision? What’s the level of urgency? There are some decisions we’re making that need an answer that minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehoIOZ"&gt;And then there are other questions we’re asking that we’ve been asking for a year now and still contemplating, right? Some more of the strategic questions that aren’t urgent, but super important. So that’s how decision-making has changed. What I would say is, I now have to be more intentional to think about all these factors and then incorporate that into what type of decision-making I am going to employ today, versus the early days, it was usually one type of decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrH4Lt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say what kind of decision-making I have to employ today, what are some types?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2TLbd"&gt;It’s like I was saying before, we make hundreds of decisions every day. Some of them are very tactical, and they’re small and they’re between maybe three people. So anyone in that foursome, if they have the same amount of information, they understand the same amount of risk and urgency. Any one of those people can make a decision. So someone raises their hand and goes, and we move on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uxpkg"&gt;What’s become newer at Poshmark, and in my world, is we look at what’s next. Where do we want to be in five years? Where do we want to be in 10 years? These are types of questions we’re asking that everybody’s coming in with a different context, different amount of information, different opinions. They’re so important to the future of the company, but not super, super urgent, they don’t have to be answered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKaHWC"&gt;And so this decision-making involves a lot of people. We’re soliciting input from different departments, different levels inside the company and outside the company, and we’re taking our time to process and synthesize this information. This is a type of decision-making we didn’t make in 2011, right? It’s like contemplating, it’s existential. So more of this is coming and what I’m learning is to have some peace and not rush things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tslOrP"&gt;I think I’m telling you an example at the extreme endpoints of my Poshmark journey from day one versus today. But the truth is somewhere along the middle, like year five or so, is when things slowly started to shift and more important strategic decisions or questions started to come up. And I think, as that transitioned, I would feel urgency to move quickly because I might not have processed that these questions are slightly different and require slightly different decision-making frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VpQuj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re three months into being a public company now, I think. One of the things I hear from the people who work and who manage public companies is suddenly there’s a score every minute of every day. There’s a stock price that moves up and down. People want to see growth, investors want to see growth. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTbQ3G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My friends who are anchors on CNBC will bring executives on and say, “What are you going to do to move the stock price?” Have you felt that influence yet, just in this early moment of being in charge of a public company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxDe8l"&gt;Well, we certainly see the stock price. We certainly see people talking about the company in an hourly, daily, quarterly mindset. So we see it, we saw this coming, and I’d say that we have been building a culture of long-term mindset within the company for multiple years now. So as we prepare for this process, we really had to take our own mindset and make sure that we stay focused, be really clear on what you want to achieve and what it takes to achieve it, and spent some time working with our executive team and our overall team to just say, look, we’re making this change. We’re going from a private company to a public company. Here’s what’s going to happen, and here are the changes we have to make to be good stewards of the company to all of our stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsCQhz"&gt;However, our mission and our strategy and the way we operate, which is the culture with which we operate, will remain the same. And so we’ve really focused, we put a lot of energy into providing stability in the team and with ourselves to go through this transition and not have it rock your world. It shouldn’t rock your world, right? We’re still operating as Poshmark. It’s just now we have a new set of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTiuGT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, but they have a ticker. Walk me through, you had a meeting. Did you have a series of meetings where like this ticker is going to exist, we want you to pay not so much attention to it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nc1xoX"&gt;I wouldn’t say we had a meeting specifically for that. It was more like, we care a lot about our culture and our team, and we know the pressure of what happens when things go up and when things go down, it can be very confusing for a company and for a team. And so because we care so much, we thought ahead of time, well before we listed; how might this impact our team, and what can we do to provide stability? And so we came out with consistent messaging well before we had to make sure that people’s north star was clear to them and you have to show, by example, things go up, things go down, but our strategy remains the same, and we reinforce that messaging through our all-hands and through individual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMucP1"&gt;So I wouldn’t say it was like everybody attended, but it’s part of, it’s weaved into everyday conversation. So when earnings calls happen or when these things happen, it’s not like, “Oh my gosh, crisis, everyone drop everything we’re doing.” It’s like, no, this is one more thing we have to do as a company, but we have 50 other things we’re doing, so let’s keep going on the 50 things, and we’ll have to do this 51st thing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B8mId"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me connect this to the people who use Poshmark; your sellers. I think a lot about hustle culture. I think a lot about creators, obviously. There was recently, I think, in December, there was a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; piece about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/get-rich-selling-used-fashion-online-or-cry-trying/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;people trying to make a living on Poshmark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; doing resale. Do you think now as you’re getting bigger, is Poshmark a career for people or is it just a way to make extra money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3gyvf"&gt;It’s both. So, definitely there is a large group of sellers on Poshmark who are here to do it part-time or as a hobby. And the reasons they might do that is either to make extra money, it’s entertainment, it’s sustainable. There’s lots of different reasons why someone would want to casually sell on Poshmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChF5pA"&gt;What we do see is a growing number of people who are either full-time, professional, or wanting to be full-time and right on that precipice where they want to make that plunge, but they’re not sure how. And that’s a growing constituency on Poshmark and that’s something that we’ve seen, and I think it’s really exciting to be able to run a platform that could support people full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQn4Eh"&gt;So when I think about what’s ahead, there’s many things we’re focused on building and supporting high-volume sellers and giving them more and more tools, so that those who want to take the lead, find more comfort and find more support. And those who have taken the lead finding that they have more and more tools to be successful with this decision is something we’re really focused on. It’s one of our key growth strategies going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbQ3H7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I wanted to connect it to your journey and the public company conversation is, we’ve been talking about the path you’ve been on, how you make decisions over the course of the past 10 years. It’s very clear that there have been periods of just exponential growth for you as a person who runs a company, as an executive, the company going public. That’s an exponential growth moment in terms of investor dollars and in terms of the size and influence of the company. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lzytu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you think about an individual seller on your platform over the course of 10 years, the dynamic between the people who use the platforms and the platforms that serve them, it feels like it can remain very fixed. Are you thinking that, okay, if you are on Poshmark and you dedicate yourself to it for 10 years, you will have opportunities to scale with the business the same way that you had the opportunity to scale Poshmark itself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbrq3N"&gt;Yeah, I don’t think that an individual seller on Poshmark, if they joined many years ago, their experience is fixed. There’s a few major ways in which their experience has grown. What’s been really, personally, a beautiful career experience for me with Poshmark is everything we do, we’re on the same side of the table as our sellers. So we’re constantly trying to make their world unfixed. And we do it in a few ways. One is, the community’s grown. The number of users on Poshmark has grown astronomically over the years. And what that means for our sellers is fresh eyeballs, fresh buyers, more people to connect with. It’s a service we provide that we don’t often talk about. You’re building a business on Poshmark, but you don’t have to look for traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6lv4s"&gt;Not only do we bring traffic to you, we bring traffic to you every day, and as we increase our personalization tools, we’re bringing qualified traffic to you. And so that’s a way in which there are more buyers to acquire for each of our sellers, and as they get buyers, there’s more people that they can engage with and try to get as repeat buyers. So that’s the first. The second is we have increased our categories. So we used to be only a women’s fashion site, and we have since, a few years back, launched our men’s category, which actually both genders are participating in buying and selling. We’ve launched a home category, which last year during this crazy time we’ve been in, has skyrocketed as people are in their homes and finding more and more things to buy and sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fp0cnW"&gt;We launched beauty last year as well, and just recently last month, we launched pets for the four-legged family member. So as a seller, we have and will continue to increase the universe of the store that you can build and therefore the customers can build. And then the last thing I would say is there’s been a lot of innovation. So there’s video, there’s drops, there’s a whole bunch of new tools that we’re inventing for people to play with and see if it works for them and their store. So I would challenge your assertion that an individual seller over the course of years is fixed. I think that we’ve made it our mission to grow the platform, so they can grow, and I hope that they’re using these tools as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gmKUt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me stay on the challenging side of this question for a minute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swBsn7"&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnybdp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is the path of all social platforms. They add new features. There’s more buttons to push, there’s more formats to develop, there’s more categories to plan. In one sense, that’s all just more work. You talked about traffic, one of the clearest user / seller criticisms of Poshmark that I have read is you have to spend a lot of time just sharing stuff, sharing other people’s stuff to participate in the feed and draw traffic to your own store, and that’s just a lot of time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGp1du"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are some Poshmark sellers that just hire another person to do that sharing work, so they can get on with the other stuff. As you add more things to do and find more ways to be competitive, are you thinking about, “Okay, how do we scale sustainable business growth?” or are you looking at, the users are going to figure out how these tools all work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhonBQ"&gt;That’s a good point. So, there’s two things that come to mind. So first of all, as you add more features and it gets more complex, particularly for a new user, it can get very daunting, right? A new seller comes to Poshmark today, for sure, they’re seeing so many more features than someone who joined eight years back. So I do think putting extra attention on really guiding the seller, if they’re starting their journey today, to not get overwhelmed with all the advanced features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7f7jF"&gt;Really just laying it out for them: here’s how to be successful, and let’s not overwhelm you, as a way of just supporting you and empowering you. So that’s the first that I recognize as something we’re putting energy into, but we’ll have to continue doing that with time. And then going to the other part, for those that are not confused by features, but are just like, “Man, it used to be two things I have to do, and now there’s 15 things I can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB9K5E"&gt;To me, that is a good choice to have. I don’t think that every tool we create is appropriate for every type of seller. The drops that I mentioned work really well for people with deep inventory. So boutiques that have 50 T-shirts, they used to have to create 50 listings, now they create one listing and they can market it to everyone who’s liked it and say, I have 50 SKUs behind this, and so it won’t sell out in a second. And so for them, the drops is an efficiency tool and we can measure that over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2fY67"&gt;That’s not going to work for an everyday, like, I just want to flip some of my closet items that I’m not wearing anymore. That tool doesn’t work. So we have different seller segments that require different types of tools, and I don’t think they’ll work for all of them. And we do want to be mindful and go towards seller efficiency and make sure the ROI is there, but I’m not sure if the goal should be, I want to do less work and make more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lb3lcR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, that’s everyone’s goal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxU5Ho"&gt;I don’t think that that should be our goal, right? We are in the business of helping people be successful. We want that person who is making $20,000 on Poshmark, if they want to make more, we want to give them the tools to enable them to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwFK9V"&gt;Well, if I think about Poshmark, right? If we want to grow, we need to grow our team. We need to grow our infrastructure. We need to build. There’s work to do to grow. And so we’ll always focus on ROI and try to make the effort as efficient as possible. But I don’t buy the “I must hire someone therefore I’m not successful.” It’s like, no, I think that’s amazing. If you are hiring someone to run your store, we just have to make sure we make it worthwhile for you, and we help direct your attention, so that that person knows what to do, and make it easier and easier for you, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFX8zO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, that’s the tension, right? You hire somebody because you think they’re going to enable you to achieve an even higher profit margin than you could do yourself. But once you start going down the road of servicing that community, the initial community of people who just want to try it out, they’re faced with doing the work of maybe three or four people, and that seems like the hard tension there for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzX8Xm"&gt;On Poshmark, we have some sellers who have 12 listings, right? And then we have some sellers with 12,000 listings and what’s required to run these two stores is vastly different. And if we can segment our sellers and really look at each persona and say, okay, the person who has 12 listings, they need this and let’s keep going on that, but the person who has 12,000 listings, they have a completely separate suite of needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIpmZf"&gt;And that 12,000-listing person, they would definitely fall under this high-volume seller that we’ve identified, and it is one of our focus areas right now, because that’s where we think that we haven’t done enough work. We were built for the 12-listing seller. We have a lot of tools to serve him or her, though the one who is more high-volume, that’s where I think we have some gaps in our platform that we’re working to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVRx5l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would make the comparison here to a more traditional social platform, YouTube, for example. YouTube is always described to me as the gold standard of creator monetization, and really all they do is serve ads for you and make it easy to do branded integrations and videos. People make a lot of money doing this. One of YouTube’s big benefits, though, is that your videos continue to exist on YouTube’s website, AdSense just keeps paying you for that long-tail archive of content. I think the best example of this is like kid video channels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHJ7hi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a toddler, my toddler watches the same five videos all the time. They’re just collecting that money. They don’t have to make any work, right? They get software-style margins from their content; they’ve paid to make it once, they’re selling it over and over and over again for effectively zero incremental cost. Depop sellers don’t have that. They have to get the clothes, they have to take the photos, they have to sell the clothes, get more clothes. Can you think of a way to add that higher-margin revenue line for your creators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ECciU"&gt;Well, in the world that we see today, it is possible for a boutique seller who has a store to put up 50 listings and kind of let it run itself. I don’t think that’s a great merchandising strategy and I don’t think anyone would do that in fashion, who runs a store. Because freshness is what drives the shoppers in, and talking to your customers is what converts them. So I don’t think the analogy is exactly the same.  So, for example, this boutique seller, she has her store going, now I’d say it’s less about running the store and more about talking to people who come in and converting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt4Rqz"&gt;And that’s where the energy goes. If you have a past customer who comes in again, being able to say to them, “Hey, you bought this size last time, do you want to buy the same thing in a different color?” Or, “I think this necklace would go great with it.” Those are the things where the energy and attention make sense. And that’s just very much part of commerce. I think what’s really great about that type of energy is I think we tend to gravitate towards the things we enjoy, especially if you spend that much time doing it. So I have to imagine people who create content on YouTube love creating video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFlVml"&gt;And like you said, you’re not one of them, I’m not one of them, but the people who run a store, they are merchants. They love running the store. And for most of the people I talk to who are in this world, the part they love is engaging with people. What they don’t love is dealing with logistics, shipping, the grungy part of customer service, like catalog stuff, but they love creating their store. And they love merchandising it there; what the entire assortment means together, how a shopper feels when they come into their store, those are all the positive, creative aspects of running a store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk8nql"&gt;So I think if we continue to give them room to innovate and create in those worlds and tackle as much of the stuff they don’t want to do, like inventory management, that kind of stuff, then we just enable people to really harness their love and tie that into whether it’s their job or their hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GtILh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That logistics stuff is kind of the heart of the Poshmark business. And it’s probably important to talk about, although I could talk about creator stuff forever. How do you make money? You charge creators a fee and then you help them with shipping, you help them with customer service, those are costs. But what is the fee structure like? When someone starts to sell on Poshmark, how much are you taking and what do you provide in return?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9x4hr"&gt;We take 20 percent of each sale, and getting started on Poshmark is completely free. Opening up your store, engaging with people, building your following. So the key to Poshmark is, as more and more people discover you and your store and they follow you, your reach gets bigger and bigger. So building that reach is part of the customer experience, and the only thing we monetize right now, if you’re successful, we take a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDoSUJ"&gt;What’s included in that? A whole host of things. So, starting from store setup: you set up your store, your catalog, all of that is managed and included. We maintain a growing community of shoppers. So like I said, you don’t need to drive traffic to your store unless you want to. We have a whole bunch of sellers who organically drive traffic to their stores from other social networks, and that’s just good for them. They’re practicing good customer acquisition strategies. However, we do have millions of buyers on Poshmark as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmkWdR"&gt;We take care of shipping through a partnership with USPS, so that as a seller makes a sale, they just have to print out the label and it’s already been paid for, and it’s already been pre-addressed. They just put it on and it’s priority mail, so it gets there super fast to their buyer. We take care of all customer service disputes, and we protect both the buyer and seller through our Posh Protect program. The world of chargebacks, for example, is a very painful reality for a lot of sellers out there in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyZS98"&gt;And our sellers do not really know what a chargeback is because we take care of it. We take care of all credit card processing. If there’s a problem with an item and a buyer’s not happy, we take care of that. So there’s a lot of not-so-fun logistics things that our team has solved, and then how we do it, honestly, is we understand it, we put people on it. But then, because at the end of the day, we’re a software company, we create software to help make it more efficient for us, so we can scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zH0YMT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you build your own internal software to scale things like shipping and customer service?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktOtNU"&gt;That’s right. So I’ll give you an example of something that we’ve had to deal with that no one else would have to deal with, right? Oftentimes, you come and you engage with people and then you go away, but that engagement often leads to a sale. So you answer questions about how it fits, you do some price negotiation, whatever. So what you find is that, especially for casual sellers, their sales can come together in one day, right? So what we would see is people would make like three or four or five sales in one day, and they might, by accident, swap the labels, right? So they would send the wrong thing to the wrong person that would go across the country, and our customer service would get an email that was like, “I didn’t order this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivSbSy"&gt;And then simultaneously someone on the other side of the country would be like, “I didn’t order this,” and it’s just such an honest mistake for a busy person who’s trying to ship packages. So it would create such havoc in the early days because we’d have to track down this package and track down that package, and now everything is automated. So we have actually built it into the flow where the seller can say, “Oops, I swapped a package,” and then automatically our system takes care of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbvtzp"&gt;We auto-generate emails to the respective buyers with an apology. And in that email is a label that’s pre-paid, pre-addressed, so that all the buyer has to do is put it on. And in any case where there’s any bad buyer experience or bad seller experience, because everything is centralized and managed by Poshmark, we can pay attention to our levels of service for various people. And so we know when someone’s a seller who has a pristine track record, and then all of a sudden they make a human error — which happens — we can see their history and factor that into our decision-making and our systems do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9J1X1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying attention to your sellers, they have a pristine track record; there’s an element of this that Instagram creators don’t have, like star rankings. eBay merchants do. Where on the spectrum of that are you keeping track of your sellers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0cHjW"&gt;Well, I think when you’re trying to build a community of sellers, we were very intentional to try to create a world where anyone can enter today to become a seller and really have a great selling experience. You can imagine, over time — this happens in other places — where over time the sellers who are high-volume and do really well tend to dominate the entire platform because they have a million five-star reviews and they filter to the top and all these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObVnEt"&gt;And so we do want our high-volume sellers to succeed, and we want to create a world where anyone can start selling today and be successful. So that’s been something we’ve intentionally thought about from the beginning. An example of something that we’ve done a little bit differently to help manage that tension, is how we approach reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92z4aK"&gt;So, like I mentioned, in a lot of websites, you filter, or the sellers who have the most five-star ratings, they get preferential treatment. And as a buyer, why wouldn’t you want to gravitate towards those sellers? It guarantees a certain level of, they’re going to ship, they’re not going to steal my money or whatever. At Poshmark, what we have is we collect ratings on every sale. So we know if a buyer has complained about slow shipment or product quality or something like that, but we don’t expose it to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SXrh8"&gt;What we expose is if a buyer gives a seller a five-star review and they leave a comment like, “Wow, I love the seller, she gave me some freebies and she was a super fast shipper, I’ll buy from her again,” what we do is we post that comment to the seller’s page, and we call it a love note. And so what happens is these are just positive comments that people are leaving. So you can go to any seller’s page on Poshmark, and just read all of their love notes that were given by people who shop for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbeuJU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you’re curating that? You have a team that’s looking through everyone’s love notes and saying, “We’re going to post these ones.”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzNvUZ"&gt;No. We post any comments as love notes that were published by buyers and gave a five-star rating.Out of five. Right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUyTW9"&gt;Now, if someone’s giving a one-star rating and they post a comment, we don’t expose it, so we don’t publicly penalize the seller, but internally we use all that data to make sure that the buyers are having a positive experience. And so if we have a seller that’s misbehaving or not providing the customer service that we would like, we can take corrective action, but we do it behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2iC12"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does corrective action look like? So you have a seller, they’ve got a bunch of one-star notes from people with bad experiences. Do you schedule a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/zoom/96"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? How does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adSnME"&gt;There’s an infinite combination of things that sellers can do where they start to — sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly — provide a terrible buyer experience, and we have a team of people that focus on that and create nuanced schedules of how we might deal with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWpFRv"&gt;So an example is, someone who ships slow has a different course of action versus someone who is violating our community guidelines, right? We think one is tolerable and can be rehabilitated. The other one is such a terrible experience and we have less tolerance for it. So each of these instances have different courses of action, but generally, once we sense that it has hit some sort of threshold, we will reach out to the buyer or the seller, and let them know that this is a problem, fill in the blank, and we expect something to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYprcf"&gt;And if it’s low urgency and the problem gets resolved, it could end there. But there are instances where a team does get on the phone with a buyer or seller, and really talk to them and try to understand, this is a repeated problem. It’s now escalated. What’s going on? And so we do have a team that reaches out and talks to people and gathers data on what’s going on. And in the extreme case, we will cut a seller off or a buyer off if they’re violating our guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfSre0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, we’ve made it almost an hour and I have an executive from a platform company, and here we are at content moderation, which comes up on, I think, every episode of this show. You’re describing a content moderation policy. You’re saying there’s some stuff that’s against the rules. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eVWtl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the important constituents that you have to deal with from a moderation and policy perspective that most other platforms don’t have to is big brands, high-fashion brands, big consumer brands. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQom63"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your users are buying and selling their goods, they’re using their trademarks. Some of those brands are notoriously litigious. I know that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sharonedelson/2021/02/01/the-realreal-cites-antitrust-concerns-in-counterclaim-to-chanel-lawsuit/?sh=5dd215f37360"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chanel and a competitor called The RealReal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; have just been in court forever. What is your relationship to the big brands like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAayCK"&gt;Well, in the world of content moderation, if any brand, big or small, flags for us that we’re in some way violating any of their trademark policies, we take that very seriously and work with them. So our relationship has been positive even from a content moderation standpoint, or like a trademark standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UChji"&gt;On the flip side, I think what we’re seeing is a shift as we grow, and as online is becoming more important and resale is becoming more important, and our engaged community is thriving. We’re actually seeing a whole bunch of inbound interest from brands on a positive note. Oftentimes, we’re seeing that a brand’s community on Poshmark is one of their largest online communities ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRdNJg"&gt;So we’re getting a lot of inbound interests saying, “Hey, how do I be part of the solution?” Whereas in the early days, it might’ve just been moderation. I think the future of working with brands is really bright in a way where we can combine forces and figure out how we can really help their customers connect with the brand more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YvwvS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have an interesting intersection of problems. There’s chargebacks and shipping fees and stuff that is very much in the physical world, and then you have the same set of digital problems as every platform, which is you have &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fposhmark.com%2Fprohibited_items_policy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F30%2F22356854%2Fposhmark-retail-future-tracy-sun-community" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a content policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. People can post fake listings of things that are against the rules, like misrepresenting, I’m reading here, misrepresenting Native American, or American Indian arts and crafts. How do you think about making a content policy for, not a store, but a platform that enables stores?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0k60uz"&gt;So when we think about content moderation or any other topic, we really start from a place where we’re committed to ensuring that our marketplace reflects our values and the values of the community we serve. And we start from that place. And as we’ve scaled our content moderation, strategy is something we put a lot of time and energy into, as you’re alluding to. The first thing we do is we really harness the power of our community to help us. It’s a growing problem, and as you grow, it grows. So what we do is we enable our community to flag any items that they think might violate our policies or our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeFt8x"&gt;And then we have a team that monitors those flags and resolves them. So it’s a three-prong approach. It’s community, we have a team, and the third, which is the place we’re innovating the most, is really seeing how technology can help us. So we’re using machine learning and rules-based detection algorithms that help to go out into our marketplace and proactively identify anything that might be suspicious, or in violation of our policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLl1iT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hear a lot about machine learning and AI-driven moderation. Have you had good results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCz9in"&gt;We have had good results in that they are helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WDR5Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Laughs] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a very politick answer there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoXO5p"&gt;Well, it’s true. We’re finding things, right? We’re finding things we might not have found before. And so it’s enough of a positive result for us to say, we need to continue this work, and we need to invest. And what we’re seeing is the smarter we get, the smarter other people get. And so you have to be committed to really fighting this battle in order to stand a chance, and so we have to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHfWQf"&gt;What we’re seeing is that if we don’t pay attention to this, it can really, like I said, it’s a violation of our values. And that’s the most important thing is to create this safe place where people can connect and transact. So yes, we’re very focused on it, it’s working, but by no means does it mean that, oh, it’s working, we can stop investing. We have to continue to invest in this area, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sX0Igj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this something you’re building? Is there an ecosystem of vendors that are working on it? When I hear about, particularly, computerized solutions to content moderation, it seems like every company trying to build their own is actually the wrong approach because the necessary rate of improvement is such that a handful of specialized firms would get there a lot faster.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RO5Y1h"&gt;Yeah. Yeah. We do both. We do both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJtECA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the more interesting debates that I’ve read about platforms like Poshmark and others is around the ethics of thrifting for resale. Most people have done it. Arbitrage is just a part of the world economy forever. Platforms like Poshmark enable you to buy out all the good stuff at a local thrift shop and then sell it for profit at a massive scale. Do you think that poses any issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3Z0zL"&gt;When I think about thrifting, to me, that’s a very positive consumer behavior. I love how shoppers are embracing secondhand, in that we are spending more time thinking about sustainable choices. And the more we can do that, I think it’s better to not waste what’s out there and to continue to value what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3k1WVu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the physicality of it is you’ve got a thrift store in a local community, and then you’re going to redistribute all the stuff out of that local thrift store across the United States, across Australia. Do you see that digital scale applied to a local community as a net positive or a negative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPw8Zb"&gt;Yeah, I think it’s a net positive to be able to support a local thrift store and to go in and provide liquidity for something that is not currently being used. And so as things distribute from a physical store to online distribution, I think it would be really interesting to think through how we can evolve as a system to see it as a positive to increase distribution, and finding homes for items is a net positive end result. So the more we can innovate and help everyone thrive in that type of system, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSrzCT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you thought about working with thrift stores, Goodwill, things like that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SzdAO"&gt;We have. In fact, we worked with Goodwill last year and during the pandemic, they helped distribute boxes from their physical store, they actually came to us and said, “How do I bring my stuff online to your sellers?” So we helped them distribute their product to the Poshmark community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1amwOq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can’t end without asking you some pandemic fashion trends, which I’m very curious about, right? You run an e-commerce platform. We’ve obviously seen a huge surge in e-commerce during the pandemic. I’m hopeful that we’re at the finish line. There seems to be a lot of light at the end of this tunnel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdYbmb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have people been buying and selling more fashion during the pandemic? Is that something you’ve seen, or are they just transacting more in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF5gvI"&gt;I don’t love the fact that we’ve gone through a pandemic, but I am a bit of a data junkie and I started my career in data and in neuroscience, like how does data show human behavior? And so this is such a fascinating topic because we did see shifts in our data based on what everyone was going through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW4E8j"&gt;And we’re commerce, right, so we didn’t really see the data of everything that’s going on, but we did see how, at least, this pandemic changed the way people are shopping. So, some trends that we saw: We saw a decline in luxury shoes and handbags. Everything makes sense, right? We saw a decline in dresses. We saw an astronomical increase in home goods and athleisure, and oddly, jewelry, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJniWC"&gt;And I attribute that to Zoom, it’s like, you want earrings. We also saw some strengthening of brands that are already popular, but became more popular. So I’m talking about, for women, Lululemon; for men, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/nike/373"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/products/brands/adidas/522"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;. So, that was a lot of the pandemic stuff. I think what’s really interesting is now we’re getting into a phase where the data’s changing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6fXpY"&gt;And so what do I mean by that? We’re seeing searches go up for summer dresses and jean shorts. And to me, that’s not athleisure, right? That’s not “I’m hunkering down” type of consumer behavior. That’s a bit more optimistic. That’s like, “I might be able to go to a beach this summer, so I want bathing suits. I want dresses because I might be able to be much more social again.” And so what I’m reading into the data, it’s just a lot of optimism in our shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MogDFv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think post-quarantine fashion looks like? I have this dream that it will be super futuristic. Everyone’s going to be wearing space suits. But what does your data tell you that post-quarantine fashion looks like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLkI6L"&gt;Our data does not predict that &lt;em&gt;[Laughs]. &lt;/em&gt;I can conjecture, not from data, that just like anything else in our daily life, the post-pandemic world is going to look nothing like the pre-pandemic world, and it’s going to look nothing like the pandemic world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEsvMH"&gt;There’s going to be some sort of weird hybrid of both. It’s such an interesting time, a year plus of, I don’t even know what to call it, like a complete upside down. Everything got changed to the point where I don’t think things are going to go back, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="51dBR4"&gt;The shift to online that was already happening and exploded during the pandemic, it’s not going to go back. Some sort of hybrid is going to happen, and this is where innovation is really possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NBA tries to make a slam dunk out of NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Top Shot is playing the long game in the NFT craze&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gEibEi"&gt;On February 22nd, Jesse Schwarz set an official NBA Top Shot record by buying the most expensive Moment on the platform. The 31-year-old paid $208,000 for a massive LeBron James dunk, in which he leaps &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; the Sacramento Kings’ Nemanja Bjelica to authoritatively slam the ball through the hoop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuuE8k"&gt;Now, you can go onto YouTube and watch a clip of this dunk. A clip of the Moment is even included in the celebratory NBA Top Shot tweet announcing Schwarz’s acquisition. But you won’t &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXfLWJ"&gt;Top Shot is part of the world of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, the buzzy new use of blockchain tech that lets people buy and sell digital items by permanently inscribing ownership records. At a high level, you might consider &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/#Blockchain-based_non-fungible_tokens"&gt;a domain name or an event ticket a non-fungible asset&lt;/a&gt; since they’re goods that can’t be exchanged for something identical — and they can’t be divided into parts. This is in contrast to bitcoin, where any bitcoin is the same as another, and it’s even possible to own a fraction of a bitcoin if you so choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="vCAYO4"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; ALL HAIL THE KING &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YoDough?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YoDough&lt;/a&gt; scooped up this Legendary LeBron James Moment from our Cosmic Series 1 set for $208,000‼️ This Moment is from our first Legendary set ever minted  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The top acquisition for any NBA Top Shot Moment ... so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Congrats on the nice pickup!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/rFLMzbwXN7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rFLMzbwXN7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NBA Top Shot (@nbatopshot) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbatopshot/status/1363969592779890690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yLP7MG"&gt;Top Shot is the best chance so far that NFTs — which are mostly the domain of cryptocurrency enthusiasts — could go mainstream. More than 800,000 Top Shot accounts are registered, leading to $500 million in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDIYdS"&gt;There are three big things going for Top Shot: it’s easy to use (and designed with people who are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency in mind), the NBA is the second-most-popular sport in America, and purchasable Moments have a familiar real-life parallel: trading cards. Each Moment, a video clip of a specific play, comes with stats about the game it’s from and the player featured, as well as the history of sale prices. And like trading cards, you can buy them in packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rlw4Go"&gt;The investing community has taken notice. Today, the company that runs Top Shot, Dapper Labs, announced it had a new funding round of $305 million, led by Coatue. Other investors include NBA players such as Kevin Durant, JaVale McGee, and Klay Thompson, as well as a smattering of MLB players, NFL players, Ashton Kutcher, and Shawn Mendes. This round means that the company has raised more than $357 million, Dapper Labs says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exc6Lq"&gt;Andre Iguodala, of the Miami Heat, was in the NBA bubble last year when he met with Roham Gharegozlou, the 34-year-old CEO of Dapper Labs. Iguodala had a general understanding of blockchain and cryptocurrencies at the time, but NFTs were new to him. Gharegozlou brought him up to speed. “From there, it was like, the rest is history,” says Iguodala. He loved the idea of bringing the NBA to his cap table and made his first investment last August. “The site is crazy great so far. I’m looking forward to sustainability, you know, keeping this thing going for the long haul and having some fun at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKWRH2"&gt;He chose to reinvest in this round based on Top Shot’s growth since then. “This was something that’s just been having some great reception, a lot of interest,” Iguodala tells me. He has his own account, where he’s been buying packs. “I bought my own Moment just because I felt like I had to have my own freaking Moment,” he says. It’s a dunk from August 4th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://nbatopshot.com/moment/Andre3rings+c882d3b8-5668-4d3c-a9f6-4e0cff7b2240"&gt;number 490 of 1,000&lt;/a&gt;. “So I’d probably call that out my favorite moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCGqhI"&gt;The first time anyone could purchase a Moment from a pack in NBA Top Shot was June 15th, 2020, as part of a closed beta; the open beta started on October 1st, 2020. Obviously, the pandemic wasn’t on the launch plan, but it appears to have given the platform a boost. Top Shot has had another tailwind: &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/why-are-sports-cards-so-hot-right-now.html"&gt;the boom in sports cards&lt;/a&gt;. On March 1st, for instance, the &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/luka-doncic-rookie-card-sells-for-record-4-6-million-becomes-most-expensive-nba-card-in-history/"&gt;Luka Doncic rookie card sold for $4.6 million&lt;/a&gt;, the most anyone’s ever paid for a basketball card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sERYEL"&gt;The players who are investing in Dapper Labs aren’t the only ones interested in Top Shot. Josh Hart, who plays for the New Orleans Pelicans, says he logs on multiple times a day to check things out. “My screen time is way up because of Top Shot,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvRzbt"&gt;Although Schwarz is noticeably excited when talking about LeBron James, it’s not just about being a fan. “To invest and set that record with the $208,000 purchase on LeBron just was an awesome Moment as a fan but obviously as an investor, too,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OX8Alh"&gt;The dunk is designated as a part of a Cosmic series, which Top Shot describes as “an exclusive Series 1 set only available for presale to those lucky hoops die-hards on our fan panel.” It’s the first series minted and one of the rarest Top Shot has put out. It came out before Schwarz joined the platform, even. His Moment is one of only &lt;a href="https://nbatopshot.com/listings/pack/7bc1ead9-2d1a-498a-9b8b-acc2b7f7e925"&gt;49 copies of that play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htZTbE"&gt;Scarcity creates value, but also, the way Schwarz figures it, the most valuable Moments will be the early ones. And if the history of social media has taught us anything, there’s a lot of money in being first — and getting the best spots early. At least, there is if Top Shot takes off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcYqIsbRSB1BzpYbyXsVfXpfsko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394720/TS_Marketplace.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kFlX4P"&gt;You won’t see the word “blockchain” anywhere in NBA Top Shot’s onboarding material. “We did a lot of testing, and eliminating the word blockchain increased conversion by 400 percent,” says Gharegozlou. “People are scared of it.” (They’re possibly also not entirely sure what it is; there’s no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17091766/blockchain-bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-meaning"&gt;consensus definition&lt;/a&gt; for what counts as a blockchain.) But that’s okay, he says. You don’t need to know about blockchain to enjoy Top Shot. You only need to know basketball and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gmv5C"&gt;The process of “minting” an NBA Top Shot Moment starts with the basketball game. In any game, there is a handful of notable plays. This means deciding which Moments to mint is a time-consuming process, one that hasn’t yet been standardized, says Adrienne O’Keeffe, who leads consumer products and gaming partnerships at the NBA. Right now, it’s a stream of emails, Slack channels, and biweekly calls, she says. Once Dapper Labs and the NBA agree on a play, it goes through a review process that includes the National Basketball Players Association. Once it has signed off, the NBA and the Players Association send the Moment-to-be to Dapper Labs to go through the process of minting. In the future, O’Keeffe says, fans might help decide, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9oWYgp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was pretty clear we both saw the potential of blockchain to transform the digital collectibles industry.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbT5BU"&gt;After that, Top Shot mints the NFT — which creates the beginning of the record. Price, ownership, and transfers will be recorded on the blockchain permanently. This is what makes each Moment unique; even if 100 Moments are made from the same play, no two will be identical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmBHhQ"&gt;The NBA was introduced to Dapper Labs in 2018, when the league was considering applications for blockchain in its business, O’Keeffe says. Dapper Labs launched CryptoKitties, a game on the Ethereum blockchain that let people trade or sell pictures of cats. Within a few days of its inception, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/?ncid=mobilenavtrend"&gt;more than a million dollars&lt;/a&gt; had changed hands. At the peak of the boom, one &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;sold for 600 ether, about $170,000 in 2018&lt;/a&gt;; now, most CryptoKitties are trading for a tenth of an ether or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TgWRi"&gt;There were some problems with CryptoKitties. First, the product used the Ethereum blockchain, which is the second-most-popular after bitcoin — and CryptoKitties’ popularity meant a lot of traffic, which made it hard to process transactions. Second, CryptoKitties proved to be a short-lived fad because there was nothing else you could &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with the kitties except make more kitties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbSJWK"&gt;After meeting with Dapper, “it was pretty clear we both saw the potential of blockchain to transform the digital collectibles industry,” O’Keeffe says. But Ethereum didn’t just work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="0094yx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtnCOo"&gt;So in 2019, Dapper finalized the architecture for Flow, its &lt;a href="https://www.onflow.org/primer"&gt;own blockchain&lt;/a&gt; that’s built specifically for NFTs. Flow is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;less of an energy hog&lt;/a&gt; than Ethereum because it’s more centralized and runs on proof of stake rather than proof of work. The company spent a year building it out: a core protocol, payments, credit card and cryptocurrency integrations — and then it launched Top Shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5AtP1k"&gt;Most users of Top Shot won’t interact with the blockchain, though. Instead, they’re just likely to have a better user experience than CryptoKitties players. New players don’t have to learn what a blockchain is or learn about the infrastructure under Top Shot, Gharegozlou says. People who trust cryptocurrency already own cryptocurrency. To reach people who might be skeptical or intimidated, Top Shot had to take a different approach. “The people that don’t have crypto don’t have crypto for a reason, right?” he says. “They’re probably scared of it. They’re probably threatened by it. And they’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVyyB3"&gt;After all, from bitcoin to dogecoin, cryptocurrency is prone to speculative manias, viruses, and scams. That’s the other thing Flow is meant to solve — because it’s a sandbox controlled by Dapper Labs. “In the early days of the iPhone, a big part of what made the iPhone successful was the App Store, right?” Gharegozlou says. “A big part of what made the App Store successful is the fact that you could easily install iPhone apps without worrying about your data being stolen or worrying about your app crashing or your phone crashing.” So the idea is to create something like Amazon Web Services but specifically for NFTs — where it’s easy to build on top of the blockchain, and consumers are safe enough that they don’t really have to think about the blockchain at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="" poster="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flIVmVQzSQBBNtDUSAGijCZq8Ik=/0x0:300x450/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:300x450):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400455/VRG_ILLO_4443_TopShots_Spot_01.jpg"&gt;&lt;source type="video/mp4" src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/81db79ae2c79ba8293a216e9b1d14eec/VRG_ILLO_4443_TopShots_Spot_01.mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div class="vrg-cite"&gt;Video: NBA Top Shot&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7z0uK"&gt;A lot of Top Shot collectors started as sports card collectors. “I was already into sports cards,” says Libruary, who joined the community in August. He’s a moderator on both the Top Shot Discord and its subreddit. “I already had a big collection. I was already wheeling and dealing on eBay.” As soon as he saw Top Shot, he “instantly loved it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omercu"&gt;The first thing he did on the platform was &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/moment/Libruary+97970719-ebb8-425e-858f-556c4dff76dc"&gt;buy a LeBron James dunk&lt;/a&gt; from February 6th, 2020, for $35. “This is the LeBron James Kobe tribute dunk, shortly after Kobe Bryant passed away,” he says. “So, this was a very special play and Moment. When I saw it, I knew instantly I had to get it for my collection.” Now, he’s got the ninth-most-valuable collection on Top Shot, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/accountValuation"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;. His portfolio was worth about $9.2 million as of March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be9VWz"&gt;In a sense, Libruary says, Top Shot appealed to him because it didn’t have the same problems as physical cards. “I live in Canada, and there’s a lot of logistical problems with shipping cardboard to the States,” he says. “So, part of it is maybe shipping to the buyer, hoping that they receive it, hoping that they don’t try to scam you.” This is to say nothing of cards that get damaged in transit. And the physical condition of the cards is clutch, which sometimes means sending something to one of a few companies that grade the cards, a process that’s both expensive and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdKWQr"&gt;And as physical objects, sports cards, well, take up space. “Typically, they’re actually in my closet, so they’re not seen,” Libruary says. But on Top Shot, anyone can see his collection. He doesn’t have to go rooting through his closet to get a card, take a photo, and upload it to the internet. There’s another advantage, too: he doesn’t have to go to the post office during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgbaNh"&gt;Not everyone was as bullish on Top Shot as Libruary; on a sports card forum where he compared Top Shot to regular sports cards, the first reply &lt;a href="https://www.blowoutforums.com/showthread.php?t=1415428"&gt;to his post&lt;/a&gt; was someone posting a GIF of a child throwing money out of a window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NJnsCn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xVXCDp"&gt;Which brings us to the big objection about NBA Top Shot: you don’t need to buy a Moment to watch a play. The NBA still owns the footage. So what, exactly, are you buying — and how does that ownership work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBrVUm"&gt;Well, you’re buying the Moment! Each has a unique identity stamped in the blockchain, which means you have an &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; version of the play, and you can sell it whenever you want. But you don’t own the copyright on the video — so no merch unless the NBA approves it in advance. You also can’t change the Moment without the NBA’s express permission, so no fancy edits allowed. The Top Shot &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/terms"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt; also forbid placing the Moment next to “images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.” If you violate the terms of service, Top Shot can, at its own discretion — and without giving you any notice — either suspend or delete your account and the Moments from the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="byh8JY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Opening a pack is often a social affair — the Pelicans’ Josh Hart, for instance, sometimes streams opening them on Twitch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LdEejJ"&gt;One way to acquire Moments is to buy a pack of Moments. (Dapper Labs, the NBA, and the NBA players split this revenue.) New packs drop sporadically. Users get an email telling them when new packs will be available. The packs range in price from $9 for a pack that contains common Moments to $230 for a pack that contains “legendary” Moments. Opening a pack is often a social affair. The Pelicans’ Josh Hart, for instance, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jhartshow/videos"&gt;streams opening them on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s so much fun,” he says. Opening a pack of Top Shot Moments works an awful lot like physical cards: you get a wrapper that you click on to open, revealing a number of mystery Moments inside. Then, one by one, you click on your Moments to reveal them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvJvX9"&gt;The packs are often themed. For instance, a Christmas-themed “Deck the Hoops” pack was released in January. A “Rising Stars” pack, released on March 7th, contains Moments of the game’s “next generation of stars,” along with some from the players who were in the 2021 NBA All-Star Game and some base set Moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OukYmG"&gt;But if you’ve logged in to Top Shot and you don’t know when the next pack drop will be, you can buy from other people; Dapper Labs, the NBA, and the players take a 5 percent cut. The market appears to view Moments from the 2019–2020 season, known as Series 1, as being more valuable than the Series 2 packs that are currently in production. Series 1 has a total of 23 sets of Moments, for a total of 840 possible plays. (The edition size on each Moment varies from one of thousands to one of, say, 70.) No more Series 1 Moments will be made, but Series 2 is still in production. So far, there are 10 sets in Series 2. In either series, low serial numbers are more valuable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnhOME"&gt;Other numbers matter, says Michael Levy, who has the second-most-valuable collection of Moments on Top Shot — worth $15.6 million, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/accountValuation"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, his favorite Moment, value aside, is a Jamal Murray layup against the Lakers in the 2020 Western Conference Finals. To Levy, it seemed very acrobatic, kind of like a mirror image of a Michael Jordan play. So as the packs associated with the Western Conference Finals were being opened, he watched the blockchain. He wanted to buy number 23 — the Moment that was Jordan’s jersey number. “I really liked the combination there of the play itself, and the importance of the serial number, and the tie back to Michael Jordan,” he says. “So, that’s a fun one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M8R7oR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s about understanding what’s baked into the price and what other people aren’t seeing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVCCSL"&gt;Many collectors view the Cosmic Series 1 set — the first “legendary” set ever minted — as the sought-after set, Levy says. Jesse Schwarz’s record-setting LeBron James dunk is from this set. “These are investments,” he says. “That LeBron that I bought for $208,000 was worth seven figures right away. And, that’s a big reason why I bought it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTzA74"&gt;Schwarz says that investing in Top Shot Moments is a lot like investing in stocks. “There’s a lot of psychology behind it,” he says. “It’s not only about what the best company or best player is. It’s about understanding what’s baked into the price and what other people aren’t seeing.” Although, in the case of LeBron James, his greatness is part of what creates the value.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hYFiQ"&gt;One other way to get rare cards is to complete a challenge. For the &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/challenges/44dab61e-60e4-4a69-b163-91930fa6da33"&gt;Rising Stars 1 Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, collectors have to get nine specific Moments. If they do this by the time the challenge ends, they’ll receive an Anthony Edwards dunk, a Moment that won’t appear in packs anywhere. How scarce it is depends on how many people manage to complete the challenge. This tends to drive certain Moments’ prices up until the challenge is completed — at which point they sink in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y3eMD8"&gt;&lt;div id="remove"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="vrg-cite"&gt;Video: NBA Top Shot&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u0A2NE"&gt;All of the investors I talked to experienced a tension between the Moments they love most and the Moments that were most valuable; they are both investors and fans. This isn’t unique to Top Shot or NFTs — it’s also true of trading cards. “These are rivalrous goods,” says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368876/venmo-paypal-square-cash-app-social-media-payments-new-money-lana-swartz-interview"&gt;Lana Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Money-Payment-Became-Social/dp/0300233221?ots=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21132917%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Money: How Payment Became Social Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “A fandom that depends on uniqueness, NFTs, and the pursuit of the holy grail object is so fundamental to the logic of this particular fandom. But it also produces value, which creates financialization and speculation, which then deprives fans of ownership of the thing they so desire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7Dk4x"&gt;As of March 29th, the market cap on Top Shot is $1.1 billion, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;, and the platform is still in beta. But it has a tailwind: it’s easy enough to get money &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Top Shot. Getting it out is somewhat more difficult. According to a post in the official Top Shot Discord on March 26th, just $18.7 million has been withdrawn from Top Shot. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u26P3u-gsa_7eWbEydNPKSXZ7XM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406174/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_9.09.59_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XkTIGp"&gt;At first, there was no way to get money out at all. Now, it takes 30 days to get approved for withdrawals, and an average of “less than 10 days so far” to get your first withdrawal out, though things might move faster or slower depending on any individual user’s activity, Gharegozlou says. “We just doubled the team last week,” he says. “We should be getting ahead of it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5y0J3"&gt;On March 26th, &lt;a href="https://blog.nbatopshot.com/posts/an-update-on-withdrawals-3-26-21"&gt;the company posted&lt;/a&gt; about its withdrawal backlog. Over the last four weeks, the number of people with access to withdrawals has increased by 450 percent, the post says. Another 5,000 people will receive access soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFNRQH"&gt;The reason these things take so long is that Top Shot allows anyone with any kind of currency from anywhere in the world to come into the system. That means heavy compliance checks, Gharegozlou says. Any money moving out of Top Shot has to be checked to make sure there isn’t money laundering, fraud, or other nefarious activity going on. Some accounts are easier to check on — people who are just buying packs from Top Shot, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF4O45"&gt;But if you’re gifting Moments to people or receiving them or buying from a lot of other people in the marketplace, every transaction has to be chased down. “Where did this dollar go?” Gharegozlou says. “Who is this other user? What payment method did they use? And that just takes longer. So there’s a little bit of variability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2R9RQ"&gt;This is not entirely unexpected. Top Shot is, after all, still in beta. As I was writing this, Top Shot turned off site sign-ups. Right now, Dapper Labs is focusing all of its efforts on scaling its operations to accommodate demand — which really took off in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="15EcHU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gharegozlou envisions Top Shot as a kind of fan club&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTyS1U"&gt;But Dapper Labs has big plans: a mobile game Gharegozlou says will roll out this year. Not only will users be able to access their accounts from their phone, but the plan is to let them use their Moments to level up players in a mobile basketball game. In Gharegozlou’s vision, having a lot of good Moments means you’ll have a stronger team. “Most people in 2021 needs to try something for free before paying for it,” he says. “And so the idea is you download an app off the app store, you start playing with something, and then you realize, ‘Oh wait, having Moments would mean I look better in this game.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9AxzA"&gt;That means the Moments do double-duty: not only are they collectibles, but they also function as something akin to a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin. And plenty of people, as video game developers will tell you, have no problem buying something that only exists online in the context of a video game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrlHFk"&gt;And maybe, sometime in the future, you might be able to watch your Moments in VR or AR — they’re 3D Unity objects, Gharegozlou says. “In the future you can beam them onto your wall, and all those things,” he says. “That won’t be this year, but we’re already set up for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPuhZr"&gt;Beyond that, Gharegozlou envisions Top Shot as a kind of fan club, ideally with perks at the real games. “The crazy thing with digital compared to physical is I can’t show up to a game with my entire card collection in my pocket, but I can show up to a game with my entire Top Shot collection in my pocket,” he says. “Then, the arena will know how big of a fan I am. They’ll know how much skin in the game I have.” And maybe the arena might do something special, like give him a free hot dog. (The ideas aren’t yet fully cooked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MbvCT"&gt;When it comes to connecting life online to life offline, Gharegozlou gets noticeably excited. He points out that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with&lt;em&gt; Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, people left their houses to go on walks to catch rare pokémon — with no benefit to it outside the game. Maybe Top Shot will be part of how the NBA lures Gen Z into the stands once live events open back up. “We haven’t even gotten started thinking about those kinds of things yet. So it’s going to be a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CchPOA-YdhqWrZml2n-cRa2CyGs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394721/TS_Packs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NBA Top Shot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebj19G"&gt;Some of the offline interactions are already occurring. Jesse Schwarz, the collector, says that NBA players are already trading Moments for real-life experiences. “They’re saying, ‘If you give me this Moment, I’ll get you a jersey,’” he says. “Or ‘If you buy this Moment from me, I’ll get you court side seats at our next game.’ That kind of thing. I think that’s really cool because it bridges the digital world and the real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFn2oZ"&gt;Still, in the digital world, there is a real community. The Discord is a remarkably polite, well-moderated place. There are multiple fan-built sites, such as &lt;a href="https://intangible.market/Account.php"&gt;intangible.market,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://topshotsignals.com/"&gt;Top Shot Signals&lt;/a&gt;, that help users figure out how much their Moments are worth, who has specific Moments, and what the overall marketplace looks like. There’s a podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.thefirstmint.co/topshot101"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The First Mint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a YouTube channel, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OwnTheMoment/videos"&gt;Own the Moment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZVLpI"&gt;And some people are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; excited. “I have one friend I had to give the responsible adult conversation, because he was like ‘I’m putting everything into it,” Iguodala says. “And I’m like, ‘Well, there’s risk in everything you do.’ He was just so excited about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYjzKa"&gt;The enthusiasm is important. It’s what creates demand. The market only works as long as people are enthusiastic about it — ask anyone with a &lt;a href="https://www.cardboardconnection.com/why-sports-cards-early-90s-worthless"&gt;box full of baseball cards&lt;/a&gt; from the early 1990s. To some degree, the future of Top Shot is more dependent on its community than it is on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJD9GT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://nbatopshot.com/user/@steve/showcases"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;, who created intangible.market, joined in August. When he first bought his packs, he immediately experienced buyer’s remorse. “I was like, &lt;em&gt;Well, what did I just buy? I bought about $30 worth of YouTube highlights&lt;/em&gt;,” Steve says. “And I sat on it for about a day and I just came to this realization that maybe there’s something more to it. So I joined the Discord as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkeep0"&gt;The Discord community was “awesome,” Steve says. He began putting together a document on how Top Shot worked. Then he started answering questions. Then he started writing tools to help people find Moments they wanted and to manage their collections. And then he wrote the initial code of conduct for how to trade Moments without getting scammed. “For a while there, I felt like I was pushing my budget for how much I should be spending on these things,” Steve says. “Because if there aren’t a lot of users joining you could be throwing money into a dead platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yBsAom"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We just try to spread the positive vibes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cibfUE"&gt;Steve now has the eighth-most-valuable account on Top Shot, worth about $9.5 million, according to &lt;a href="https://evaluate.market/accountValuation"&gt;evaluate.market&lt;/a&gt;. He’s a moderator on the Discord, and it’s getting increasingly difficult to keep up. Now the question for him is how to grow Top Shot in a way that’s sustainable. There are roughly three communities in the Discord: people who are huge basketball fans, people who are really into NFTs, and people who just want to make a buck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmcE07"&gt;“Obviously the financial returns and the fun of finding a hobby that I really enjoy has been fantastic, but probably the best takeaway from my perspective is meeting the people and the community and kind of finding new friends,” says Michael Levy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDw1aY"&gt;Levy’s a recurring guest on a YouTube stream called Club Top Shot, where he got to talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-DSEXvGKoE&amp;amp;list=PLsaIqi9mL1lITsFb4sCSRrciCAvIUvFcB&amp;amp;index=7"&gt;with the Golden State Warriors’ Damion Lee&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Conley, an NFL player who most recently played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uf_wpyzkFw&amp;amp;list=PLsaIqi9mL1lITsFb4sCSRrciCAvIUvFcB&amp;amp;index=3"&gt;has also dropped by&lt;/a&gt; the stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck4IYJ"&gt;Early on, everyone in the community knew each other — it was that small, Levy says. With every trade, he knew both people involved, so it was easy to send over a message to both and congratulate them. When Libruary joined, there were only 100 active buyers a day, and the Discord only had a few active users. “Any sale that was over $500 really got attention back then,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFhaJq"&gt;As the Discord has gotten larger, different kinds of people have come in, Libruary says. Some people are trying to shill specific Moments, but that’s frowned upon. “Whenever there’s any kind of dip in any kind of market, any values of Moments, there’s a very vocal minority that get very angry if a Moment goes down,” he says. These users are spreading FUD: fear, uncertainty, and doubt, he says. His big tool for combating that is “empathy,” he says. “We just try to spread the positive vibes. And we realize there’s going to be critics out there, but we just have to roll with it. And honestly, there’s so much positivity right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDPrqB"&gt;There were some periods early in Top Shot’s lifespan where people questioned whether Dapper Labs was making good decisions with the supply of Moments and whether the website itself would hold up with a larger user base, Levy says. “It’s really exploded and become very, very mainstream,” he says. “So it feels validating to see it all play out the way a lot of us hoped it would.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOWHgq"&gt;Top Shot Moments have something the art world NFTs do not: a community of believers who are attempting to understand the value of each Moment in real time, and that may make them a better investment than some of the flashy art world auctions. In fact, Top Shot Moments may ultimately be worth more than bitcoin, Steve tells me. No one has an emotional attachment to a specific bitcoin. It’s just a number in your wallet. But when Tyrese Haliburton shouts out Top Shot — that’s special. The fact that no two tokens are identical — that’s special, too. It encourages a sense of ownership, which in some sense, is what the fans are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e5NVaX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What, exactly, is a &lt;em&gt;sense &lt;/em&gt;of ownership worth in dollars?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zoDF8W"&gt;Through the blockchain, the NBA is re-adding uniqueness to something that is widely reproduced. The collector community is what determines the value; after all, it wasn’t Dapper Labs that decided that low-serial-number Moments were the valuable ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4zbwT"&gt;For anyone who’s interested in how value is formed — in art, on Wall Street, or anywhere else — Top Shot’s community is worth watching. One benefit of the blockchain is that it’s possible for outside observers to track when specific Moments began to take off in value, as well as which packs the community thinks are most important. Watching the Discord, it’s possible to see people trying to decide what a sense of ownership is worth in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjxsZK"&gt;It’s hard not to view Top Shot as an inadvertent social experiment. Fans often &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/07/characters-belong-to-fans-or-creators.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; a sense of ownership&lt;/a&gt; over the things they love, even if they don’t actually own the intellectual property. Top Shot essentially monetizes this, letting hardcore fans buy a sense of ownership in their favorite plays. After a while observing the community, one gets the sense that — more than anything else — Top Shot is several sociology and economics dissertations waiting to happen. What, exactly, is a &lt;em&gt;sense &lt;/em&gt;of ownership worth in dollars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldwUxt"&gt;Top Shot is a better system than the art NFTs for observing this because the community means there’s consensus around price. By contrast, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple’s NFT famously sold for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; — but there’s no real way to know if that valuation is accurate. Whether there’s a resale market for that Beeple NFT is an open question, one that might not be answered for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jPWjg"&gt;On March 22nd, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rohamg/status/1374103328095805445"&gt;Gharegozlou tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that more than 300,000 people were in line for a pack drop from the Cool Cats set. Among collectors who open at least two packs and do at least two trades on the marketplace, retention is 98 percent over a 12-week period. These are impressive numbers — but 12 weeks is a limited period of time. CryptoKitties was, after all, a short-lived fad for most participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2O0ZVV"&gt;In the meantime, Josh Hart is collecting his own Moments, as well as those of players he thinks will be future Hall of Famers. “I have my jersey number (#3/299) Metallic Gold LE Series 1,” Hart says in an email. “I will give that to my kids one day.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Nest Hub (2nd-gen) review: sleep on it</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new Nest Hub is just as good at being a digital photo frame as before, but it’s slow for everything else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ANkmKy"&gt;Here’s the thing about the new $99.99 Nest Hub from Google: it is slow. Compared to almost any other touchscreen device you might own or interact with, the Nest Hub is laggy, sluggish to respond, and has stuttering animations all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IwbDI"&gt;The reason for this is because since Google first launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;original Home Hub in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (now known as the Nest Hub), it has regularly been adding more features and more capabilities to the device. While it was essentially a digital photo frame and basic smart speaker with a screen at its debut, the Nest Hub is now capable of being a smart home control center, fancy alarm clock, weather machine, media center, communications hub, and more. It’s a lot of stuff for the processor in this little screen-with-a-speaker to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X57Pzq"&gt;The latest feature that Google has added is automatic sleep tracking, which uses special sensors built into the new Nest Hub’s display bezel to track your movement and breathing at night to evaluate your sleep. Google is also using those sensors to add some basic gesture controls, and it has beefed up the speaker inside the Nest Hub to improve its audio quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0PSFy"&gt;For the 20 percent of Nest Hub owners that keep the device in their bedroom (according to Google), this new sleep tracking feature works very well — it’s by far the easiest and most comfortable way to track sleep that I’ve tested. But for the other 80 percent, I’m disappointed the new Nest Hub hasn’t meaningfully improved the experience over the prior model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frscf3"&gt;Slow might be okay when all you’re doing is looking at photos or asking for a weather report, but when a device is promising to be a true smart home hub, speed matters a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b9H3sJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10418836"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TZVL87"&gt;The design of the new Nest Hub is almost identical to the first version: it’s a 7-inch touchscreen perched atop a base with a speaker in it. The screen itself is the same as before, with a 1024 x 600 pixel resolution and Google’s automatic ambient brightness and color adjustment features that make images look great no matter the time of day or lighting in the room. Google has dropped the small lip around the bezel that was on the prior model — this makes it a little easier to wipe the screen clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhOiNk"&gt;The rest of the Nest Hub is just like the prior model, but now you can get it in a light blue color in addition to the light gray, dark gray, and light red fabric options. It still doesn’t have a camera, which is a good thing if you plan on putting this thing next to your bedside, though it now has three far-field microphones instead of the two on the last version. A physical mute switch is on the back to disable them if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiLPUF"&gt;The first Home Hub had a rather lousy speaker that was easily trumped by smart speakers that cost half as much, so I’m glad that Google used a larger, 1.7-inch driver in the new model. The sound is fuller, with better bass response, and the Google Assistant’s voice sounds more pleasant when it responds back to me. The Nest Hub still won’t take the place of a Nest Audio or other well-equipped wireless speaker when you really crank it, but it no longer puts a frown on my face when playing music or podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xu8tWIDEQTfBV5nSOzNZd_RsNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399100/dseifert_20210323_4485_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frame around the display of the new Nest Hub is home to the Soli radar sensors, far-field microphones, and ambient light sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QJcjnd"&gt;The interface that Google started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522326/google-assistant-smart-displays-nest-hub-dark-mode-new-interface-multiple-accounts"&gt;rolling out to the older Nest Hub late last year&lt;/a&gt; really invites you to touch the screen and rely less on voice commands to do everything. But as I mentioned at the outset, the Nest Hub is just too slow to really make this a pleasant experience. There’s a noticeable delay whenever I touch the screen and the animations to switch between the Nest Hub’s various functions are stuttery. Google says it is using a faster processor in this new model, but wouldn’t specify how much faster, and I couldn’t tell the difference between it and the prior version when it came to swiping around the screen and tapping buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E4XzhO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nest Hub is just too slow to make Google’s latest interface a pleasant experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="biy0Jh"&gt;That means that instead of using the touchscreen, I’m still using my voice to control the Nest Hub most of the time. But even there, the new model is slow to respond, with a long enough lag and delay to recognize my voice commands that I often wonder if it heard me at all. The ability to transcribe and show me what it heard right on the screen is one of the best features the Nest Hub has over Amazon’s smart displays, but watching each word slowly populate on the screen feels like I’m watching a TV show with closed captions that are three lines behind the actual dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAYjLR"&gt;Google claims the new model has an on-device machine-learning chip to speed up the Assistant, that will learn common commands over time to further improve responsiveness. But as with the allegedly faster processor, if the new Nest Hub is any faster than before, I didn’t notice it in my everyday use. The fastest voice assistant in my experience remains Siri on a HomePod, followed by Alexa on Amazon Echo speakers and displays, and then the Google Assistant on Nest products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QZftdGNUcK2uMk80wYiiBlbzLA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399113/dseifert_20210323_4485_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Hub comes in a soft blue color, as well as light gray, dark gray, and light red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SCx3Ar"&gt;All of that is a lot of criticism, which is applicable if you use the Nest Hub in a kitchen, home office, living room or somewhere else in your home. But if you do put it in your bedroom, I am happy to report that it is a very good smart alarm clock and automatic sleep tracking device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrKItJ"&gt;The sleep tracking is enabled by Soli radar sensors in the Nest Hub’s bezel. Google’s been trying to find a use case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/30/21496318/google-soli-radar-motion-sense-rick-osterloh-pixel-5"&gt;the Soli technology&lt;/a&gt; ever since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer"&gt;debuted in the Pixel 4 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and I think this might be the best application of it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lhGu3K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sleep tracking with the Nest Hub is much more convenient than a wrist-worn fitness band or smartwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="diTtCL"&gt;Unlike wrist-worn fitness bands or smart watch sleep trackers, the Nest Hub doesn’t require you to wear anything to bed and doesn’t need to be recharged from time to time. You just place it on your nightstand about an arm’s length or less away from your bed, and point the screen towards where you sleep. Its radar sensors are sensitive enough to track your breathing and movement, so the Nest Hub can tell when you’re moving, when you’ve fallen asleep, and when you’ve woken up. Its microphone records how often you cough and snore during the night, which might put an end to many spousal arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRUE8o"&gt;Google claims the Nest Hub’s sleep tracking can be as accurate as much more scientific methods, though I wasn’t able to actually test that. In my experience, it works just as well as the Fitbit Inspire HR I wore to bed alongside it, often landing within 10 minutes of what the Fitbit recorded. It also claimed I snored a number of minutes each night, and is able to record the room temperature and brightness levels during the night — data points that wrist-worn trackers just don’t have. If it’s too warm, too cold, or too bright in the room for optimal sleep conditions, the Nest Hub might suggest I change the thermostat or adjust the lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXB8wz"&gt;(For the smart home aficionados, no, it is not yet possible to trigger Google Home routines using the new temperature sensor in the Nest Hub. Neither is it possible to yet do anything with the Thread radio that’s in the Hub — it’s dormant for the time being.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yATFvB9QYk6PQCrHwwc505XO1hU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399102/dseifert_20210323_4485_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub can measure how long you’ve spent in bed and how much of that was spent sleeping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0RVmAzAGiHhnlubvoY8JLFpKFG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399111/dseifert_20210323_4485_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hub will tell you if you are hitting your schedule goals or not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgrIhB0FN7vEHz5xN9lSE0Tp6PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399109/dseifert_20210323_4485_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Soli radar sensors are sensitive enough to read breathing rate and the Hub’s microphones record how much you cough or snore at night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJdNJzPSzjVxgF_YU2Aluv4GtM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399112/dseifert_20210323_4485_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub uses its temperature and light sensors to monitor if the room conditions are ideal for sleeping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="zvu98F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10419130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M0EeQ9"&gt;Each morning when I wake up and dismiss the alarm, the Nest Hub gives me a report on how well I slept the night before. It tells me what time I “went” to bed, what time I fell asleep, how long I was sleeping, how long during the night I snored or coughed, my respiratory rate, and if I adhered to my intended schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5AW3g"&gt;After a number of nights measuring my sleep, the Nest Hub provided suggestions on how I can improve its quality — so far, it tells me I’m doing a poor job sticking to my sleep schedule, though not for the reasons you might expect. Because I tend to lie in bed reading or watching TV before going to sleep each night, the Nest Hub claims I go to bed one to two hours before I actually fall asleep and chides me for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB9nK8"&gt;All of this data is also available in the Google Fit app on a smartphone. Google does not yet give a numerical score for the quality of sleep, like other sleep trackers do, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s added in a future update. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;announcement of the Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, Google said the sleep sensing features will be available as a free preview for all Nest Hub owners until next year, but it declined to give specifics on how much it will cost after the free preview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCtr3f"&gt;The Nest Hub’s sleep tracking is convenient, but it’s far from perfect. As mentioned, it can’t tell the difference between me lying in bed and reading or watching TV or attempting to fall asleep, activities that rarely tripped up my Fitbit, which relies on heart rate and movement measurements to evaluate sleep. I also am trusting that its microphones are picking up my coughs and snores and not my spouse’s — I really have no way to verify that data without sticking a camera in my bedroom and recording the night, which I’m not willing to do. And like every other sleep trackers you can buy, the Nest Hub is able to provide a lot of data, but it cannot diagnose sleep disorders or really provide any helpful insights other than the obvious ones of sticking to a routine and making sure the room is quiet and comfortable. This is very much a wellness device and not something to take the place of medical diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpY7CT"&gt;Still, the Nest Hub’s automatic sleep tracking is extremely easy to use and I really like how I don’t have to wear an uncomfortable bracelet to bed each night or bother with remembering to charge its battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f2s5qJY4Vfkm9oNX427BoG2eu1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399106/dseifert_20210323_4485_0007.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub is a competent, if slow, smart home dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CVvGAX"&gt;Beyond the sleep tracking, the Nest Hub is also a very good smart alarm clock. I can easily set the alarm with my voice; there are a variety of alarm sounds to choose from in addition to music or a radio station of my choice; and I can simply wave an arm in front of the Hub to snooze the alarm (another new feature enabled by the Soli sensors) or say “stop” when I’m ready to get out of bed. There’s also the option to gradually brighten the Hub’s screen or turn on smart lights in my room before the alarm sounds to mimic a sunrise, but that was more annoying than helpful for me and I ended up turning it off after a few nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBUaAf"&gt;One thing to be aware of: the Nest Hub, like other smart displays, does not have a backup battery, so if you lose power overnight and it’s not restored by the time your alarm is supposed to go off, the Nest Hub will not wake you up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SP8ARO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new Nest Hub is a minor update over the prior model, with sleep tracking being the standout new feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O0hVlO"&gt;Overall, the new Nest Hub is a minor update over the prior model, with some handy new sleep tracking features that may or may not be important to you. The Nest Hub is still an excellent digital picture frame for images you have stored in Google Photos, and it’s a competent smart speaker and smart display. I actually prefer it over Amazon’s Echo Show devices for the purpose of being an ambient screen that automatically rotates through memories because all of my photos are in Google Photos, not Amazon’s cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="R4bHxB"&gt;But I wish Google had spent as much time optimizing the performance and experience of the Nest Hub as it has adding new features, which seem to be bogging down the device more than anything else. If you’re embedded in the Google Home platform, the Nest Hub’s price and compact size make it easy to add to your home, but otherwise, life is too short for slow computers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix lays out plans to slash its greenhouse gas emissions</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fkiP9x"&gt;Netflix set out goals today to limit the damage the company does to the climate. By the end of 2022, it wants to reach “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions. That means it plans to reduce some of its emissions and find ways to offset or capture the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY0kxu"&gt;By 2030, Netflix says it plans to cut emissions from its operations and electricity use by 45 percent. That goal roughly lines up with &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/#:~:text=Global%20net%20human%2Dcaused%20emissions,removing%20CO2%20from%20the%20air."&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from leading climate scientists, who have found that greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by about 45 percent globally this decade. But Netflix will eventually need to ramp up efforts to prevent pollution generated by producing and streaming its movies and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PBGVHR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A strategy with a checkered history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RXRkwJ"&gt;To meet its deadline next year, the company is primarily relying on offsetting its emissions, a strategy with a checkered history when it comes to how well it actually slows down climate change. Netflix plans to invest in programs dedicated to preserving and restoring ecosystems that naturally store planet-heating carbon dioxide. Efforts to cancel out companies’ carbon footprints by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;planting trees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;preserving forests&lt;/a&gt; have failed to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the past. Netflix, however, says that it has developed a thorough process to vet these kinds of projects, which might include visiting the sites in person or monitoring their progress via satellite. But many environmental advocates have pressured companies to do more to stop polluting in the first place, rather than relying on trees to clean up the mess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivNqlo"&gt;Netflix disclosed its annual carbon footprint for the first time today in an environmental social governance report. That revealed that the company generated roughly 1.1 million metric tons of CO2 last year, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to the yearly emissions from about 240,000 passenger cars. That total still doesn’t account for emissions that come from the internet infrastructure needed to stream its shows, or from the devices people use to watch its content.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpfUeG"&gt;Netflix did pollute a little less in 2020 than it did in 2019, but probably not by design. Production for a lot of Netflix content was delayed last year because of the pandemic, which the company said was the main reason for the 14 percent drop in emissions last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="VvnsYY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Before the pandemic, Netflix’s energy use skyrocketed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ5iz1"&gt;The year before the pandemic, Netflix’s energy use actually skyrocketed. It used &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-electricity-usage-2019-increase-megawatt-hours-1203496610/"&gt;84 percent more electricity&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 compared to the year before. (Its subscriber base grew 20 percent over the same time period.) Netflix attributed much of that rise to the company self-producing more of its own films and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7620J7"&gt;The physical production of Netflix’s branded content was responsible for half of its entire carbon footprint in 2020. Corporate operations and purchased goods made up another 45 percent of emissions, while data centers made up 5 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF7a8G"&gt;To cut down its planet-heating pollution moving forward, Netflix says it will replace fossil fuels with renewable energy as much as possible. When it comes to filming around the globe, the company said it plans to hire more local crews to avoid pollution from travel. It also wants to make its operations more efficient so that it can cut down on how much energy it uses in the first place. It has the most control over that at its own studios, but the company says it will also try to influence vendors and data center providers with whom it works. One small change the company has already made is the switch from incandescent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024834/lightbulbs-energy-efficiency-standards-trump-climate-change"&gt;vastly more efficient LED lighting&lt;/a&gt; in many of its studios. Not only do LED lights use up less energy, but they also reduce cooling costs because they’re not as hot as traditional bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k6RcJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The film industry needs a leader when it comes to climate action.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHVQwf"&gt;“The talent loves it because it doesn’t melt their makeup in the same way that incandescent bulbs did, so it’s a win-win-win,” says Emma Stewart, who was hired last year to become Netflix’s first sustainability officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20lQGU"&gt;Even incremental changes could eventually add up to big wins for the planet. “The film industry needs a leader when it comes to climate action. Changing the world begins with one company stepping up and inspiring others to join them. I’m thrilled at how Netflix is taking on this leadership role,” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said in a statement on Netflix’s new sustainability goals. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Codename: Urban Legends is a taste of what Niantic thinks 5G could do for AR gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g22CO7uRg3ebCUxumkI0ShCf9kI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047739/5G_MEC_Codename_Urban_Legends_Hero_D__1___1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2X0fuI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic has &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-5g-multiplayer"&gt;unveiled &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which it describes as “a multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks.” The game revolves around casting magic spells to kill monsters and rescue allies. It’s similar to Niantic’s previously released games, but the trailer includes a unique feature: multiple players interacting with the same augmented reality creatures from their own phones. Niantic says it’s just a demo at the moment and not for general consumer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaDxce"&gt;It’s an exciting shift from Niantic’s previously released games like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, and the company says this is largely thanks to 5G&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Although its games have had multiplayer elements, for the most part each player exists in their own augmented reality worlds. For example, while the same pokémon appear on the map for every player in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, each player can only view and interact with their own creatures in AR. In other words, you can’t throw a pokéball to catch someone else’s augmented reality pokémon. (&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; has a limited &lt;a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?s=buddy-pokemon&amp;amp;f=shared-ar-experience-with-your-buddy&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;p=web"&gt;shared AR experience mode&lt;/a&gt; where you can see other players’ pokémon but not interact with them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iP56r2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A multiplayer demo experience that offers a glimpse into the future of AR and 5G networks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BaVrf9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legend&lt;/em&gt;s isbuilt on the same platform that underpins the augmented reality games &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;. Niantic hopes that AR gaming will be 5G’s “killer app,” benefiting from its higher speeds, lower latency, and ability to keep lots of people’s phones connected to the internet in a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trziOF"&gt;Niantic says that carriers from its &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;Planet-Scale AR Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — an organization formed of over half a dozen carriers around the world aimed at developing augmented reality 5G experiences — have been network testing the game. These include Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, Globe Telecom in the Philippines, and Verizon in the US. Niantic &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/niantic-planet-scale-ar-alliance-5g"&gt;formed the alliance last year&lt;/a&gt; to promote and develop augmented reality experiences for 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtaV8l"&gt;Although it’s a cool demo, &lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reliance on 5G risks replicating some of the geographical issues that affected &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go. &lt;/em&gt;5G coverage is currently concentrated in cities, meaning players living in more rural areas risk losing out (&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends &lt;/em&gt;works on both Sub-6GHz and mmWave variants of 5G). It was a similar situation when city-dwelling &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go &lt;/em&gt;players benefited from having more pokéstops and gyms compared to players out in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGG3TC"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t say when the demo might turn into a real game or on which phones it runs. However, Niantic tells us the game will be exclusive to its carrier partners’ customers once it releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JFiPv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Codename: Urban Legends&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting tech demo, and it has the potential to expand on &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;’s augmented reality features in some interesting ways. We just want to know when players will be able to dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
