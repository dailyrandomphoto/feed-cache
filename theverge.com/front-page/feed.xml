    <title>Inscryption mod makes the game’s best part endlessly replayable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cstoxegAdPnRiLG4lZTS9Xp4kvE=/151x0:1770x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70272932/ss_738220c84b63522c4ca8c77fbff1ddb252ea0fe9.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FUmcX0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;, my game of the year, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/22796149/50-best-video-games-of-2021-polygon-goty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;’s game of the year&lt;/a&gt;, and what should be your game of the year, is getting a free mini update that gives its fans exactly what they want —  a way to endlessly play the game’s first act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvgYEa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1092790/view/3141821139285428848"&gt;Kacyee’s Mod&lt;/a&gt;, available now as a playable beta, adds new cards, items, and a difficulty modifier that make &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;’s already challenging card game even spicier. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DMullinsGames"&gt;Daniel Mullins&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;, says he made this mod in response to fans’ overwhelming support of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVqmt0"&gt;“This mini-expansion is in part an expression of my gratitude,” Mullins wrote on Steam. “I have received countless requests for an endlessly playable version of Part 1 that emphasizes Leshy’s deckbuilding roguelike as a standalone experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pfveY"&gt;Part one of &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt; locks you in a cabin with a vicious woodsman who will only release you if you beat him in a succession of card games. Through progress across three maps and solving an assortment of escape-room style puzzles, players earn new cards, enhance current cards, and assemble a collection of items that can turn a lost game in your favor sometimes at a gruesome price. Players familiar with&lt;em&gt; Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; will recognize their elements in &lt;em&gt;Inscryption.&lt;/em&gt; The cards you use to beat the woodsman have attack and life values and unique abilities that synergize with one another to create devastatingly overpowered combos that are an utter delight to assemble and trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vPB3c"&gt;From beginning to end, &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt; is a shining achievement in storytelling and gameplay, and &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;’s first act is the strongest, most compelling, most addictingly fun part of that achievement. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22757407/inscryption-review-pc-steam-devolver-digital"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I lamented that the game ended, wishing there was some way to set the game on an endless loop of deckbuilding and boss fights. Kaycee’s Mod is an answer to my and many others’ wish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apl8Ls"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge denies California’s attempt to intervene in Activision Blizzard settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZAbzS2vlt27ZeuUIDFDBJ6MfXds=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70271586/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0j2ciR"&gt;Today in federal court, a judge said she will deny the state of California’s attempt to intervene in the $18 million settlement between Activision Blizzard and the EEOC, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/activision-judge-denies-california-bid-to-challenge-settlement"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjyDpc"&gt;The denial prevents the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing from joining the EEOC’s lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in order to oppose the consent decree that accompanies the creation of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;$18 million settlement fund&lt;/a&gt;. The DFEH filed the objection in October, stating that the consent decree would harm the state’s case against Activision Blizzard, asserting the decree could, among other adverse outcomes, potentially allow for the destruction of evidence necessary to the state’s case or release the company from state claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRA2C5"&gt;The EEOC and the DFEH &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737003/activision-blizzard-discrimination-lawsuit-dfeh-response"&gt;have been at odds&lt;/a&gt; over their respective cases against Activision Blizzard. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735273/activision-blizzard-requests-stay-in-harassment-lawsuit-alleging-conflict-of-interest"&gt;Activision Blizzard filed a stay&lt;/a&gt; against the DFEH lawsuit claiming some of the lawyers involved in the state’s case should be disqualified based on conflict of interest rules. Activision Blizzard filed this stay after the EEOC brought this conflict of interest information to its attention, which was notably after the DFEH objected to the EEOC’s consent decree and settlement. In &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; report, the judge brought up this spat between the two public offices, calling it “unseemly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HK4bke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DFEH filed the objection in October, stating that the consent decree would harm the state’s case against Activision Blizzard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2vTxk"&gt;Though the DFEH will not be allowed to object to the consent decree, that doesn’t mean the judge will allow the $18 million price tag to remain. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823991/activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-victim-press-conference"&gt;In a press conference last week&lt;/a&gt;, celebrity lawyer Lisa Bloom, on behalf of one of Activision Blizzard’s victims, said the settlement was “woefully inadequate” and asked for an increased fund of at least $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DV9buN"&gt;The EEOC and Activision Blizzard will submit clarifications on the consent decree to the court in January. The state of California will have the opportunity to submit comments, and a formal ruling on the decree should come soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for working from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bH6jbLi3TDyvU9UoR_NtRR4DuJc=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177496/Work_from_home.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts to outfit the home office of a working professional&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8r44SV"&gt;Many of us have been working from home for more than a year and a half, and some of us will continue to do so — maybe forever. That said, buying a gift for a friend or loved one who works from home can be tricky. One person might prioritize tech, while another might care more about plant life and energizing lighting. If you need some help, however, you’ve come to the right place. Here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;we have some expertise in working from home, and we have some great ideas for you to consider before time runs out and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3edj4"&gt;What makes the ideal home office? Well, the right tech, like the Satechi USB-C Multi-Port Adapter ($80) and the Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced mouse ($100), are essential to getting work done. But comfort is also important, which is why we’ve included a standing desk, a laptop stand, and an ergonomic chair that can last for years. And if your gift recipient is one who enjoys blowing off steam and a good laugh, an impulse buy like a single-shot Nerf Jolt blaster ($4) may be all they need to keep their sanity. We’ve got ideas big and small, both for physical comfort and a sound state of mind. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is rolling out automatic captions for videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pLQRWvfgXR8kFulym7HHUbG0iQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270185/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xakdgA"&gt;In a major boon for accessibility, Twitter is now rolling out automatic captions for videos, the company announced Tuesday. Auto captions will be available globally on iOS, Android, and the web in “most languages,” according to Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PalhwE"&gt;However, there’s one significant catch with the automatic captions: they’ll only appear on &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; videos uploaded to Twitter. Old videos that don’t have captions still won’t have them. There’s also no way to report inaccurate or bad captions, a Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; though they say “we’re always looking at ways to improve our accessibility features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyBmrg"&gt;Twitter has a somewhat rocky history with accessibility features, though it has taken steps to improve. The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;heavily criticized&lt;/a&gt; for launching voice tweets in 2020 without captions, and it came to light soon after that Twitter didn’t have a dedicated accessibility team at the time. Twitter has since created &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible"&gt;two teams focused on accessibility&lt;/a&gt;, and it did eventually add captions to voice tweets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579420/twitter-voice-tweets-captions"&gt;though more than a year after they first launched&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has also added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;live captions to Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, its Clubhouse-like audio room product.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gotta go fast: Sonic is coming to Tesla’s in-car system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Tesla Model 3 interior is displayed with a Sega Genesis game controller sitting under the infotainment screen with a window on the screen showing the game Sonic 1." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJcBDfppqsq9FOUW-AARRUMmgDs=/0x283:4032x2971/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70271208/IMG_0936.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the Sonic 1 title screen opened in the Tesla web browser (the game is not available yet)&lt;/em&gt; | Image: The Verge (By Umar Shakir)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M4B0Ej"&gt;Sega is bringing back the original 1991 &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; game — this time for Tesla Arcade. A PR representative for the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 1&lt;/em&gt; will be available on all Tesla models but did not share a timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGy15N"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted about the new Sonic game by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816202/courtney-love-elon-musk-bernie-sanders-kendall-roy-succession-taxes"&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt; pestering senator Bernie Sanders. The Tesla CEO replied to his own November tweet of a Bernie Sanders “once again asking” meme where the senator is poorly photoshopped with Dr. Robotnik’s mustache and glasses... asking for Chaos Emeralds (the in-game secret power-ups scattered in each zone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LS0OLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sonic, the Hedgehog, game coming to all Teslas!&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1469957953142808579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cHSUQp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; is the crazy-fast side scroller where the titular blue hedgehog rushes to the finish while collecting golden rings. As a grim reminder: it’s the one where pressing Down and A does nothing — though some re-releases (and there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of re-releases) did add the &lt;em&gt;Sonic 2&lt;/em&gt; “spin-dash” move that hurls Sonic forward from a stand-still.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On a table, there are four devices: an iPhone 13 mini, Genesis mini, Nintendo Switch with blue and red joy cons, and a rose gold MacBook Air. devices with screens are showing sonic the hedgehog 1 game. A sonic character image on a coaster is propped up in the genesis console slot." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6OAf0j-HWVz2sus3UTHSsYYi2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087525/IMG_2494.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge (by Umar Shakir)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It took me four minutes to arrange a picture of four platforms that have Sonic 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivagsu"&gt;Speaking of re-releases,&lt;em&gt; Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; is available on almost every platform — and is not regarded as the best of the main Sonic games (&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; writers agree &lt;em&gt;Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic &amp;amp; Knuckles,&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Sonic 3 &amp;amp; Knuckles&lt;/em&gt; are all far superior games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dqau3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; is also a much more repetitive game since there are six “Zones” with three long acts each, compared to 10 zones with two acts each in &lt;em&gt;Sonic 2&lt;/em&gt; — giving players a lot more variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqHsQh"&gt;Tesla Arcade has become the cause of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823127/tesla-car-arcade-games-safety-nhtsa"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; because some games work while the vehicle is in motion. Recent games added to the Tesla Arcade such as &lt;em&gt;Sky Force Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; will work while you’re driving, but it remains to be seen if &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt; will also work that way. “Passengers turn into players as they race at lightning speed across classic zones,” reads the statement &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; received from Sega — a reminder that games are only for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtvHPL"&gt;It’s cool to see Tesla still releasing new games — and though the company has not yet delivered on promises of high-end games like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; for the new Model S &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;with an AMD chipset&lt;/a&gt;, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18649466/tesla-car-cuphead-elon-musk-interview-summer-release"&gt;teased and released&lt;/a&gt; platformers like &lt;em&gt;Cuphead &lt;/em&gt;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0r0u5m"&gt;Sega tells us that the game will support a USB-connected controller, so we expect that a USB Genesis controller will work for the full-speed nostalgic experience of zipping through Green Hill Zone... just keep your seat belt on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SiriusXM sued for failing to provide podcast transcripts for Deaf users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IF6NfIyjGB5vjDl8CBa0JWgvsNY=/1x0:535x356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70271143/siriusxm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SiriusXM, along with its subsidiaries Stitcher and Pandora, are being sued by Deaf advocates | SiriusXM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGWTmM"&gt;SiriusXM is facing a lawsuit from the National Association for the Deaf (NAD) and the Disability Rights Advocates (DRA) for failing to provide captioning and transcripts for “the vast majority” of its podcasts. According to the complaint, SiriusXM and its subsidiaries Pandora and Stitcher are in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and New York state law for failing to make their podcast streams accessible for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Neo1lO"&gt;“Defendants’ failures to provide transcripts of their podcasts excludes deaf and hard-of-hearing persons from the critical sources of news, entertainment, educational programs, and popular culture that Defendants make available to their hearing customers, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the New York State Human Rights Law, and the New York City Human Rights Law,” the complaint states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWqEp5"&gt;The lawsuit notes that the ADA requires companies providing services to the general public are expected to provide the services in a manner accessible to people with disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tk36S7"&gt;The lawsuit does not name Spotify, producer of some of the most well-known podcasts, including &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;. Spotify doesn’t yet provide a transcript for Rogan’s shows (although some third-party apps provide transcripts). In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441886/spotify-podcast-transcription-accessbility-app-update"&gt;Spotify announced it would begin auto-transcribing&lt;/a&gt; some of its original shows, with the aim of eventually enabling transcripts across all its podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJEzKE"&gt;“We can’t sue every bad podcast provider in a single lawsuit and had to start somewhere, but it is important to deaf and hard of hearing users that transcripts be provided across all podcast platforms,” Christina Brandt-Young of DRA said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s deeply concerning to us that even when the authors of podcasts make their transcripts available elsewhere (like some podcasts from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;), SiriusXM, Stitcher, and Pandora don’t provide them through their services, making our clients work twice as hard to get the same information everyone else gets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qgFfo"&gt;She noted that transcripts are easy to provide, “and these are multimillion-dollar companies. It’s time for them to do the right thing and provide podcast transcripts on their websites and apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yx89im"&gt;The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages and an injunction requiring the companies to provide transcripts for all their podcast content and to “affirmatively market the availability of transcripts to deaf and hard-of-hearing” people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5pMZT"&gt;Sirius XM didn’t respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Opal’s C1 offers DSLR-rivaling video quality in a small form factor</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Stellar design and performance, with more improvements to come&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3bHgPq"&gt;Would you consider buying a $299.99 webcam? That’s the cost of Opal’s C1, which is now available to purchase on an invite-only basis. My guess is that many of you will say no. Others, who are on the never-ending quest to look good for all of those Zoom meetings, might have a list of questions in need of some &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;convincing answers, and rightfully so. Like, why pay this much when there are so many other more economical options, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281765/webcam-phone-tablet-android-ios-pc-mac-how-to"&gt;using your phone as a webcam&lt;/a&gt;? And why go with newcomer Opal over legacy brands like Logitech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evrRCw"&gt;Opal has good answers to those questions. But having a chance to try the webcam itself was more convincing than any answer I received. The C1 aims to — and mostly succeeds at — supplying DSLR-like image quality (complete with plenty of background separation or bokeh) for far less than a decent camera-turned-webcam might cost you, without all of the dongles and other hardships that sometimes come with the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tFdZah"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10919482"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="713HTf"&gt;The C1 was designed by Kenny Sweet, who was responsible for the cute but misguided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17055618/google-clips-smart-camera-review"&gt;Google Clips camera&lt;/a&gt;, among many other popular tech products. That ID comes through here, but it almost looks like something that Essential might have whipped up. The C1 is available in either a white or black colorway, and its paint finish is matte with glossy speckles that only show themselves in certain lighting. I don’t want to gush too much, but it’s lovely to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Opal C1 camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zvJVzN-UmOm4ARx6UUQSKMP9tj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067803/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The C1 has a low-profile build that doesn’t stand out too much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Opal C1 camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWYhZUs37PuNJ0B_J7EeXIcSEO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067801/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bottom has a rubberized grip, plus a tripod mount.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQkqi4"&gt;The C1 has an indicator light that’ll let you know when the camera is in use. The front of the webcam also hosts stereo mics in its grille, with an extra noise-canceling microphone on its rear. Compared to my MacBook Pro’s built-in microphone, my voice is just as clear, but through the C1 it has a little more resonance and depth to it. When I was recording a sample, some home construction next door started, and while its noise cancellation effects weren’t great, it was capable of picking my voice out from all of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jOBNzs"&gt;Here’s what the stereo microphones in the Opal C1 sound like:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086976/opalc1mic.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086976/opalc1mic.mp3"&gt;Here’s what the stereo microphones in the Opal C1 sounds like&lt;/a&gt;(opens a new window)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q7TtBJ"&gt;The backside looks like a heatsink you’d apply to an M.2 SSD inside your custom PC, and indeed, it’s partially used for dissipating heat (in addition to looking rad). It’s also where you’ll find its USB-C port. Opal’s webcam includes a sturdy mount that can hang onto a monitor or a MacBook lid, though the webcam itself can attach to any ¼-20 tripod mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFQiFm"&gt;The C1 features the Sony IMX378 sensor (the same one &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-imx378-comprehensive-breakdown-of-the-google-pixels-sensor-and-its-features/"&gt;used in Google’s first Pixel smartphone&lt;/a&gt; released in 2016) capable of up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second behind an f/1.8 lens. It currently defaults to 1080p at 30 frames per second because Opal says 4K can crash videoconferencing apps. The higher resolution is there as an option, so owners can utilize it for streaming or recording if they want. I was initially bummed out that the C1 lacks the capability to record at 60 frames per second, but it nevertheless seemed to run more smoothly in video calls than other webcams that I had on hand, like Elgato’s $199.99 Facecam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUwXpK"&gt;This is where Opal’s pitch for the C1 starts to sound more like a phone than your average webcam. Software has become the secret sauce responsible for driving many features in the best smartphone cameras. And like the top phone makers, Opal, too, is putting just as much (if not more) thought into the software side of the C1’s performance, not just the specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Opal C1 camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ow9cSGIh_68-FRNy9ca8fqZKNzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067806/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The automatic settings in the Opal app on macOS produced this warm, detailed image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PM6zfo"&gt;The C1’s automatic settings excel at making me look far better in multiple lighting scenarios than any webcam I’ve tried so far. The out-of-the-box settings also produce a better image than even my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/25/9201455/olympus-e-m10-mark-ii-hands-on-photos"&gt;Olympus E-M10 Mark II&lt;/a&gt; mirrorless camera. I bet it’d be a closer race if I labored over tweaking my camera’s numerous settings, which feels like an arcane skill that I sadly lack. That’s the big advantage of the C1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9sN2g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers who’ve used recent flagship phones probably know from experience that the power of software to enhance picture quality cannot be understated. But it’s not just software at play here. The C1 has an Intel Myriad X chip inside that helps to power the set of features presently found in the macOS app, which are a mix of what you’d expect to see for a webcam, along with some interesting additions (Windows support is coming in late 2022, though the C1 works as a plug-and-play device right now). The app itself is currently considered a beta and Opal says it plans to add more features in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Opal C1 camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H8Ztmw0ZEx-mCO8gnqVZ7CsVkCc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067805/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can make your feed pixelated if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Opal C1 camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1CH7PwgJKBX4aY821zu3CwHN4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067804/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included mount is very sturdy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Kub7K"&gt;My work desk is positioned in such a way that I’m backlit by windows, which always presents a challenge for webcams and DSLRs alike to light me adequately and to make my skin look its natural color. Yet, I was happy leaving the task up to the C1 to figure out what was right because it reliably made me look good. But if you’d prefer to tweak, there are several settings in the macOS app that can be customized, including focus locking at a range of distances, brightness, exposure, saturation, contrast, vibrance, and white balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP8htT"&gt;Digging further into the app, the bokeh slider can add some simulated blur to your background. Despite some similar halo effects to what we usually see from portrait modes on phones, the end result could easily be confused for the real thing, particularly when it’s viewed through a streamed video call. Opal says its webcam has its own “graphic rendering pipeline that actually models the physics of how light enters a lens through a hexagonal lens – all to make a Bokeh effect that is far more convincing.” Basically, Opal figured out a software solution to this hardware problem, as many phone makers have, to defy what’s possible with these tiny lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oxTzt"&gt;The C1’s artificial blur is far more convincing than Zoom’s blurred background feature, but it doesn’t provide the same level of privacy that Zoom’s does — it’s still possible to make out what’s in the background behind you. It’s more akin to the Portrait Mode that Apple baked into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;latest version of macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ociYDq"&gt;Another optional feature that you can turn on is “Face Lock,” which follows your face’s movement, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;Apple’s Center Stage feature on iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The “stickiness” of this feature is controlled by a slider in the app and at high settings it almost seems to predict your movements instead of reacting to them. It can look blurry and a little distracting on the high setting (you can see what that looks like in the video below), so I imagine most people will want to keep this setting on low to medium for a more smooth, subtle tracking effect. Another thing I liked during my time with the C1 is that any changes that I made to the camera’s settings were applied automatically, even when I was already using it in Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mWRK0W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.294%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/d9onuj" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VWkYyY"&gt;Many of these features aren’t novel in the realm of webcams, but the company has more ideas to take advantage of its Intel chip and software. One of the more ambitious ideas is gesture recognition. Opal intends to let users drop from video calls by signaling the peace sign or to zoom in on their picture by making a pinch gesture in front of the C1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8ns28"&gt;Additionally, the company is testing an update for release in the coming months that will use machine learning and neural networks on the Intel chip to improve how you look and sound. It aims to deliver a feature called Studio Sound that’ll push the voice quality through a neural net to enhance the level of depth and clarity to rival a dedicated podcast-grade microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uefgwr"&gt;It also wants to be able to utilize the C1’s software and hardware to evaluate your behavior in calls, like grading you on how much eye contact you gave or how well you did at reducing filler words like “ums” and “uhs” in your speech. Opal didn’t attach a timeframe to these ideas, or comment on whether they’ll be opt-in features, but these would push the C1 far beyond what other webcams are attempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Opal C1 camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/siwa5zrz0tBBaDoEx9FJItTRLMc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067799/cfaulkner_141231_4911_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design of the Opal C1 is one of my favorite things about it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A2wVZF"&gt;We’ll have to wait to see whether Opal delivers on any of these promises, but for now, it delivers on the goal of being a convincing stand-in for a DSLR. It’s far simpler to setup, use, and manage than my large camera or even a smartphone converted to work as a webcam. There are no batteries, space constraints, multiple cables and dongles, or driver woes to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lgQ3JZ"&gt;The C1’s biggest obstacle is its $299.99 price. But if you primarily work from home and value having a stellar picture in videoconferencing apps, this might be worth it to you — especially if you’ve tossed around the idea of investing in a pricey DSLR (or already did).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pony.ai’s permit to test driverless vehicles in California is suspended after crash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pony.ai Tests Self-driving Car In Guangzhou" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Zx-T_wk-fzJ9XrCqfAH9d3XDDI=/73x0:2149x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270959/913385808.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GYSD2M"&gt;Pony.ai, an autonomous vehicle startup based in Silicon Valley and Guangzhou, China, is temporarily unable to test driverless vehicles in California after a vehicle crash led the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to suspend the company’s testing permit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw9vBb"&gt;Pony.ai was one of the few companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22449084/chinese-startup-pony-ai-autonomous-vehicles-california"&gt;approved to test fully autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; without safety drivers behind the steering wheel on public roads in California. The DMV has only issued permits to seven other companies, including major operators like Waymo and Cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZuHbt"&gt;But the permit was suspended — and Pony’s name removed from &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/"&gt;the DMV’s list of permit holders&lt;/a&gt; — after a reported vehicle collision in Fremont, California on October 28th, the agency said in a statement. Pony has 10 Hyundai Kona vehicles registered under its driverless testing permit. The company is still authorized to test vehicles with a safety driver behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KpfWsZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pony’s AV “came into contact” with a center divider&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B2SW1s"&gt;The permit was suspended after the company &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/pony-ai_102821-pdf/"&gt;reported a crash to the DMV&lt;/a&gt;. (All AV permit holders are required to file reports after a collision.) According to the report, Pony’s vehicle was in autonomous mode, turning right onto Fremont Boulevard from Cushing Parkway when it “came into contact” with a center divider containing a traffic sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tqTcQ"&gt;“The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage,” the report states. “There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X991Zr"&gt;Fremont Police were called to the scene. Pony said that it later reached out to local authorities to “resolve all issues” related to the damaged street sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvUwbJ"&gt;“The safety of the motoring public remains the California DMV’s top priority, and the department’s autonomous vehicle regulations provide a framework to facilitate the safe testing and deployment of this technology on California public roads,” the DMV said in a statement. “When there is an unreasonable risk to public safety, the DMV can immediately suspend or revoke permits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FtMuJc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This represents a hurdle to Pony’s commercial plans in the state&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPOici"&gt;This represents a hurdle to Pony’s commercial plans in the state. Shortly after receiving its driverless testing permit in May, Pony.ai founder and CEO James Peng told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was seeking approval to include those vehicles in its robotaxi service in California. “We are actually at the final stage of getting the approval for travelers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZZB8U"&gt;Pony.ai was valued at $3 billion after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;$400 million investment from Toyota&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company has been testing autonomous vehicles in Beijing and Guangzhou since late 2018 as well as in Fremont and Irvine, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYvTvA"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Pony noted that the company’s autonomous vehicles have driven over 750,000 miles in California since 2017. Pony is also conducting its own investigation into the October collision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VbIVo"&gt;“We are proud to have one of the industry’s best safety records,” the spokesperson said. “We look forward to a safe resolution to this incident.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="U81KPe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;is getting Slayer, Free-For-All (FFA), Tactical Slayer (SWAT), and Fiesta playlists, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/re5kdv/playlist_update/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; from u/ske7ch343, otherwise known as 343 Industries’ community director Brian Jarrard (via &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/halo-infinite-getting-new-playlists-dec-14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Jarrard confirmed that the four playlists are coming to the game via an update on December 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Halo Infinite MP is getting four new playlists on December 14th: Slayer, Fiesta, FFA, and Tactical Slayer (SWAT)   &lt;a href="https://t.co/DeTJQEz5zy"&gt;https://t.co/DeTJQEz5zy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hzTLFGA2De"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hzTLFGA2De&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1469748946906099715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKfwjO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816491/halo-infinite-multiplayer-deathmatch-slayer-dedicated-playlist"&gt;343 Industries previously&lt;/a&gt; said that Fiesta, SWAT, and FFA playlists would be coming to the game by the end of the year, while a Social Slayer playlist wouldn’t arrive until sometime in 2022. In his post, Jarrard acknowledges that developers promised a Social Slayer playlist with “a variety of new variants.” But since this wouldn’t get done before the holidays, 343 has decided to launch a basic Slayer playlist first, and will “look to bolster and expand with more variants” in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8nkmo"&gt;Currently, you can’t choose your game mode. You’re forced to rotate between Capture The Flag (CTF), Slayer, Strongholds, and Oddball, which is obviously a pain if you prefer playing one game type. It’s also an annoyance if you’re tasked with completing a challenge that corresponds to a specific mode, however, 343 is addressing that complaint as well — Jarrard says that the December 14th update will remove “particularly frustrating” mode-specific challenges as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dFoFpn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update will remove “particularly frustrating” mode-specific challenges&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc04Sr"&gt;The update will also lessen some requirements for challenges, make the weekly ultimate challenge “less intensive,” and will add challenges specifically for the upcoming playlists. 343 is also slowly trying to implement performance-based XP — something that the game currently doesn’t offer — by adding a challenge category that’s “based on accumulating player score.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrsKaT"&gt;Right now, you’re only rewarded with XP for completing challenges, not for each game you play, which has been a major complaint among players who want to level up. Last month, 343 attempted to address battle pass progression issues by adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788990/halo-infinite-battle-pass-progression-xp-changes"&gt;a “Play 1 Game” challenge&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the duration of XP boosts, and rewarding players with more XP for the first six matches they play in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNZlh5"&gt;In addition to these changes, Jarrard also noted that developers are working on fixing the “intermittent hiccups” that seem to affect Big Team Battle (BTB), and is also taking a look at ranked matchmaking after hearing reports of “potential anomalies.” Although &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; was officially released on December 8th, players are still waiting for the co-op story mode that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;set to become available in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a way to replay individual levels in the campaign, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821522/halo-infinite-campaign-levels-replay-mission-select-343-industries-microsoft"&gt;which 343 says it will add&lt;/a&gt; but doesn’t have a set timeline for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Shop our curated guide for everyone in your life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SxVkbR"&gt;Finding the perfect gift for everyone special in your life can be, frankly, a nightmare. Some people are easy to shop for, but others in your family or social spheres might be less forthcoming about their desires. You could do the leg work of asking what might make them a happy camper over the holidays, but who has time for that? That’s a rhetorical question. No one has time for that, especially with shipping deadlines looming and delivery dates slipping further and further into January.&lt;/p&gt;
