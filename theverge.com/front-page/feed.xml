    <title>Apple faces yet another class action suit over throttling iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OF3kxJ"&gt;A consumer advocacy group in Europe has filed the latest class action lawsuit against Apple saying the company intentionally throttled older iPhones in Italy. First reported by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/apple-hit-with-another-european-class-action-over-throttled-iphones/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new lawsuit seeks €60 million (roughly $73 million) in compensation — or about €60 per device — for owners of iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus models sold in Italy between 2014 and 2020. Euroconsumers, an umbrella advocacy organization in the EU that includes Italy’s Altroconsumo, says the €60 compensation is the average amount consumers paid to replace their devices’ batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpCdG1"&gt;“When consumers buy Apple iPhones, they expect sustainable quality products. Unfortunately, that is not what happened with the iPhone 6 series” Els Bruggeman, head of policy and enforcement at Euroconsumers, said in a statement. “Not only were consumers defrauded, and did they have to face frustration and financial harm, from an environmental point of view it is also utterly irresponsible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPl1GT"&gt;Euroconsumers filed two similar lawsuits in December on behalf of member orgs Test-Achats in Belgium and OCU in Spain. The group said &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/iapmw8ie3ije/4zMgaeXbZ5sZEqwiSNyVck/dea9914bb631761645b034b120ec7f9f/Euroconsumers_Class_Action_Apple_-_Italy_.pdf"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; that it plans a fourth lawsuit in Portugal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="va2i0t"&gt;“We have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” an Apple spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vKW3C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161271/apple-settlement-500-million-throttling-batterygate-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;Apple agreed to a $500 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; in the US last March, after it admitted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16800058/apple-iphone-slow-fix-battery-life-capacity"&gt;slowing down older iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. It compensated consumers who bought an iPhone 6 or 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16806582/apple-battery-slowdown-science"&gt;were throttled to preserve battery life&lt;/a&gt;. The case grew out of the tech giant’s “Batterygate” controversy, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;iPhone users discovered in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that iOS limited processor speeds as iPhone batteries aged. Apple didn’t reveal to consumers that the feature — meant to address problems with phones’ performance — existed. Users said if they had known about the slowdown feature they would have simply replaced the battery rather than buying an all-new phone, as many did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xgwRv"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/18/apple-fine-battery/"&gt;agreed to a second settlement&lt;/a&gt; in November — this time, with 34 US states —for an additional $113 million. The state attorneys general said Apple “fully understood” that by concealing the intentional slowing down of older phones, the company could profit from people buying new phones rather than replacing the batteries. Apple did not admit to any of the allegations in that settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbRVAT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 25th, 10:45AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Apple spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgAxZd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkCOjt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify now hosts audiobook recordings from YouTuber David Dobrik and actress Hilary Swank</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BlI2tL3-fc5P8XGCGP9och8azZI=/72x0:857x523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716805/Audiobooks_Pilot_H_2021_1611357123_928x523.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c5DmVZ"&gt;Spotify isn’t limiting its audio ambitions to podcasts and music. Today the company announced it’s furthering its audiobook experiments with the release of nine new audiobooks available exclusively in the app. As first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/spotify-tests-audiobooks-with-frankenstein-jane-eyre-and-other-literary-classics-exclusive?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, among the works, which are all part of the public domain, are David Dobrik narrating Mary Shelley’s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;; Forest Whitaker reading Frederick Douglass’ memoir &lt;em&gt;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&lt;/em&gt;; and Hilary Swank narrating Kate Chopin’s&lt;em&gt; The Awakening&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also releasing an accompanying audio series called &lt;em&gt;Sitting with the Classics on Spotify, &lt;/em&gt;a show in which Harvard professor Glenda Carpio explains the stories’ histories and narratives for a modern listenership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuAEFd"&gt;Although this is Spotify’s biggest effort in audiobooks to date, it’s not its first attempt. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21247804/harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-reading-philosophers-stone-spotify-video"&gt;first partnered with J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World&lt;/a&gt; to release &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone &lt;/em&gt;in audio form&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The chapters, which came out weekly, featured celebrities like Daniel Radcliffe, Dakota Fanning, Claudia Kim, and David Beckham. (The show no longer appears to be listed in Spotify, but we’ve reached out for clarification and will update if we hear back.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk9wB2"&gt;The decision to pursue audiobooks is interesting, especially given the fact that the company is starting out with public domain works, meaning Spotify doesn’t have to pay to license them. It’s a lower-risk investment for the company, which it might need given that some analysts &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/spotifys-big-bet-on-podcasts-is-failing-citi-says.html"&gt;are starting to advise&lt;/a&gt; clients to sell their stock because they don’t see podcasting efforts yielding high returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9IpU3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>To all the streaming services you’ve never heard of before </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPIOVgINobfQ-vfmX7NkgVfTVtA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716677/acastro_210119_4370_streamingQuiz_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncJToZ"&gt;The competition for streaming services is playing out in the same way the tech industry has over the past decade: a small handful of big names, backed by a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exmJ7i"&gt;But for every Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, and Hulu, there are a dozen smaller, more obscure streaming services — many of which you’ve likely never heard of. In fact, let’s see if you can tell the difference between the names of real streaming platforms and ones we’ve made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AavcLD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22008812#"&gt;Take the quiz on The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JFiJjy"&gt;
&lt;p id="ENk6pL"&gt;For every household streamer — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; — there are a dozen that few users would likely recognize. How many people can explain what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153029/comcast-xumo-acquisition-streaming-wars-tv-film-viant-myspace"&gt;Xumo,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184294/fox-tubi-acquisition-streaming-wars-news-sports-xumi-comcast-pluto-viacomcbs"&gt;Tubi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228486/fandango-vudu-streaming-purchase-walmart-comcast-nbcuniversal-amazon-itunes"&gt;Vudu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552590/viacomcbs-streaming-paramount-plus-earnings-q3-license-pluto-tv-competition"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt; are? How about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21352648/tv-shows-streaming-options-fatigue-netflix-hbo-max-hulu-amazon-prime"&gt;Acorn TV&lt;/a&gt;, Ovid, and Popcornflix?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PUZKv"&gt;But all of these obscure services may play a vital role in how the streaming business looks in the future — or at least media conglomerates believe that enough to spend hundreds of millions to billions to acquire them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Sz56n"&gt;Crunchyroll, a streamer dedicated exclusively to anime, has more than &lt;a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/07/28/crunchyroll-crosses-three-million-subscribers"&gt;3 million paying customers&lt;/a&gt;. Shudder, which is dedicated to horror and thriller content, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/shudder-hits-1m-subscribers-as-key-part-of-amc-networks-targeted-streaming-approach-1234582104/"&gt;passed 1 million paying subscribers&lt;/a&gt; last year. BritBox, which is focused on British TV, also passed the 1 million paying subscriber &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-prnewswire/4f1b9c818dd5d200242696096c37e6be"&gt;mark last year&lt;/a&gt;, doubling its North American customer base in just 14 months, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hdRt8"&gt;But these numbers aren’t exactly meaningful in a world where Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;boasts 203 million global subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, some companies see owning a portfolio of these smaller streamers as a way to compete indirectly with larger platforms. Crunchyroll was owned by WarnerMedia (which also owns HBO Max) until recently, when it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;sold to Sony for $1.175 billion&lt;/a&gt;. (The sale has not closed yet at the time of this writing.) Shudder is owned by AMC Networks, and BritBox is co-owned by BBC and ITV. They’ve become niche plays for sizable audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Deeo1h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;potential growth is key — not every niche streamer has it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5O6hqn"&gt;If Netflix and Amazon Prime Video want a massive, general audience, their bet is that people will pay for more specific genres of stuff (or endure ads) to watch. Want nothing but wrestling content? WWE &lt;a href="https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork"&gt;has a streamer.&lt;/a&gt; The Criterion Channel &lt;a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/"&gt;indulges cinephiles&lt;/a&gt;, while Boomerang hosts &lt;a href="https://www.boomerang.com/"&gt;nothing but old-school cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that there’s a specific streamer for everyone, and executives operate under the assumption that there’s just enough of a hungry audience to turn those niche interests into recurring revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rnmt7"&gt;“What we’ve seen over the years is that there has always been a home for content that caters to a particular area of interest,” Alden Budill, head of global partnerships and content strategy at Crunchyroll, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our user base craves community inclusion in one place, and we really think that we have an opportunity to be that place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlRvgL"&gt;Crunchyroll was started in 2006 by a group of Berkeley grads as a place to host anime clips and provide a place for anime fans to congregate. It caught on quick. The more lucrative anime’s budding viewership in the United States became, the more attention it drew from larger organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rt456"&gt;By 2017, Crunchyroll had more &lt;a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/02/09-1/crunchyroll-surpasses-over-one-million-paid-subscribers-details-daily-giveaways-to-celebrate"&gt;than 1 million paying subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, AT&amp;amp;T bought &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_otter_media.html"&gt;all of Otter Media&lt;/a&gt;, including Crunchyroll, and rolled it into its new WarnerMedia division. The platform gained more than 2 million paid subscribers in that time, reiterating to WarnerMedia executives that anime was a massive potential growth area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzOUen"&gt;That potential growth is key — not every niche streamer has it. When AT&amp;amp;T acquired Otter Media alongside its Time Warner acquisition in 2018, the telecom giant shuttered a number of niche streamers. Korean drama streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/dramafever-korean-drama-streaming-service-shutting-down-n921221"&gt;DramaFever was shuttered&lt;/a&gt;, as was the &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/filmstruck-shutdown-warnermedia-turner-1202998364/"&gt;art house-focused FilmStruck&lt;/a&gt;, with most of its library moved over to HBO Max. If the goal of streamers is to bring in and keep subscribers, finding niche genres of content that have ample opportunities to grow is crucial. Anime is a well-established and popular form of entertainment that Crunchyroll proved can continue to build an audience. It’s less clear if a service dedicated to K-dramas can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EA0Kl3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s what fans want. It’s how you get it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vCT7lL"&gt;“Whether it’s a 24/7 cable channel that’s dedicated to cooking, a mobile app that is dedicated to Pac 12 Sports scores, or a streaming service that is dedicated to anime, I wholeheartedly believe that there will continue to be an appetite for and a format for that kind of focused, deep dive-type of experience,” Budill says. “It’s what fans want. It’s how you get it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6SDwg"&gt;Figuring out the formula for a niche streamer or advertisement-supported platform’s worth comes down to its purpose. Fox bought Tubi (an ad-supported, free movie streaming service) for nearly $500 million because it wanted a streamer to carry its titles in an effort to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-03-17/fox-acquires-tubi-for-440-million"&gt;grow its audience&lt;/a&gt;, alongside other licensed series and films, while selling better targeted advertising compared to its cable division. AMC &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-networks-finalizes-65m-deal-acquire-robert-johnson-s-rlj-entertainment-1130611"&gt;effectively bought Acorn TV&lt;/a&gt; (a subscription service that carries British television shows and films) for $65 million because its CEO, Josh Sapan, believes it can grow to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/do-niche-streamers-fit-a-sea-services-1253172"&gt;more than 10 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia sold Crunchyroll to Sony likely because executives believe licensing certain titles is the more cost-effective way of providing anime to HBO Max subscribers without having to pay for the entire operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0mArk"&gt;Certain bets on niche streamers are working. Crunchyroll, Shudder, BritBox, Acorn TV, and WWE Network are finding their audiences and continuously hitting subscriber milestones. But as more giant companies try to find ways to pivot to streaming, either launching their own or acquiring services with already impressive followings, is there still a place for niche &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; streamers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LYMI2"&gt;One example of continued independent perseverance in the face of an industry swept up by consolidation is Mubi. The European-based streamer has remained independent over the last 13 years, finding success by leaning into areas that gigantic entertainment streamers don’t. While Netflix spends about $90 per subscriber on content (the streamer notably has annual content budgets north of $15 billion, and in 2020, it would have reached $18.5 billion if not for the pandemic), Mubi spends about $18 per customer, according to Mubi CEO Efe Cakarel. Mubi can exist with a smaller subscriber base because it offers a smaller library — just 30 movies at any given time. Not having a massive selection suddenly becomes its appeal; Mubi is tightly curated, rather than being an ocean of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfFbWZ"&gt;“In a world where Netflix really won the game, in order to survive in a world where Netflix exists — and now Amazon, Apple, and Disney — you need a very clear differentiation,” Cakarel said while &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoAMr4QtMA"&gt;speaking at &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; Disrupt in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. “As a young startup, this is a very difficult industry to crack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JicApN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;streaming services are a dime and dozen, and many of them won’t survive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SXxeWM"&gt;Mubi isn’t the only streamer leaning into catering to a smaller, specific audience to stay afloat and succeed. Kweli TV is a streaming service dedicated to carrying films by and about Black people. In August 2020, CEO DeShuna Spencer &lt;a href="https://melanmag.com/2020/08/22/can-your-demographic-afford-this-kweli-tv-founder-talks-to-melan/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Melan Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it grew from 2,000 to 35,000 paid subscribers in under two years. Like Mubi, Kweli TV offers exclusives and a curated library built around directors. FloSports has more than 500,000 subscribers (avid fans of cycling, rowing, and other non-major sports) across its 25 channels, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/niche-sports-streaming-service-expands-while-giants-retrench"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SeeUL"&gt;People subscribe to the platform to watch specific things, a different experience than signing up for Netflix to peruse a huge catalog. The best way to compete with the giants is by simply finding the places where they are too big to compete. Still, streaming services are a dime and dozen, and many of them won’t survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEeWZU"&gt;Like many stories out of Silicon Valley over the last several years, it’s David versus Goliath — or at least, David gets acquired by Goliath. Smaller companies doing clever things for an engaged audience are being swallowed up by bigger conglomerates. AT&amp;amp;T did the same thing with Otter Media and Crunchyroll before selling it off to Sony Pictures, whose executives also saw a way it could fit into the greater Sony ecosystem. AMC bought Acorn TV, Fox bought Tubi, Comcast bought Xumo and purchased Vudu from Walmart, ViacomCBS bought Pluto TV, and Sony Pictures bought a Christian streaming service called Pure Flix. This morning, NBCUniversal’s announced its service, Peacock, would be the new “exclusive home” for WWE Network content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13cgUI"&gt;One study from August 2020 found that nearly half of US households &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/08/more-than-half-of-u-s-households-now-subscribe-to-multiple-streaming-services-study-1203025747/"&gt;subscribe to three or four&lt;/a&gt; video streaming entertainment platforms, which means there’s space in the market for niche streaming platforms to find their footing with smaller, specific libraries for smaller, specific audiences — but only if they don’t get swallowed up by media conglomerates first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKTBT8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s flagship noise-canceling headphones are back down to their lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VJkKec_L_7ss0zTbcD00koez2IA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716660/IMG_0625-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7JPGMM"&gt;If you’ve found yourself wanting some peace and quiet, whether it’s from the upstairs neighbor’s kid stomping around above you or just to silence other distractions, today’s marquee deal has your name written all over it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;The Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are $72 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers — matching the lowest price yet that we’ve seen happen a few times now. We first saw this price drop occur during Prime Day last October, and it went on to become one of the most popular deals of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qns6lF"&gt;This model is almost identical to the previous generation (WH-1000XM3), with its similarly sublime audio quality and noise cancellation effect. What’s new in this set, though, is a sensor that automatically pauses music when you remove them, then resumes when you put them back on. It also has improved voice quality and, perhaps the biggest improvement, support for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ePoDWf"&gt;Apple’s USB-C 20W wall adapter costs $19, but you don’t have to pay that much to get the fastest-possible charging speeds for your iPhone. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0828WB2VR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aukey’s 20W USB-C wall charger is $7.69&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon (usually $13) right now. You’ll need your own USB-C cord (either one that ends in USB-C if you own an iPad Pro or the latest iPad Air, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H256MBK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C to Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for all iPhones). Of course, this is also a nice, affordable option that’s suitable for any USB-C device, be it an Android phone or a Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC Theatres staves off bankruptcy just in time for studios to delay their films all over again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Entertainment &amp;amp;amp; Tourism Industries In New York City Struggle Under Pandemic Restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/29wNHsGcpQchZ5K7pz_1atCnNS0=/0x0:6192x4128/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716610/1284144321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jMrpgf"&gt;AMC Theatres has raised nearly $1 billion in funding since December 14th, staving off bankruptcy for several more months, the company announced today. The announcement comes just days after several major studios, including Paramount, Sony, and Disney’s Fox, all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;delayed many of their films&lt;/a&gt; to the latter half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYUXP1"&gt;In total, AMC raised $917 million, &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/28598a3b-69d6-4e3e-8858-2bfa385c3268.html"&gt;according to public documents&lt;/a&gt;. More than half of that capital arrives in the form of equity that comes with selling 164.7 million new common shares. AMC raised another $411 million in incremental debt that is scheduled to be paid off by mid-2023, according to the filing. As such, AMC Theatres executives now believe they have a new “financial runway” that extends “deep into 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHBR6i"&gt;“This means that any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table,” AMC CEO Adam Aron said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkfkJR"&gt;How long that runway will actually last if nothing changes isn’t crystal clear, but public documents filed by the company say that “in the absence of any increase in attendance levels” and assuming that AMC will still have to pay its leases without any additional cash raised, “our existing liquidity would extend our operations through to July 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ep7EIv"&gt;Still, having a deep runway is good news for AMC Theatres executives, who will likely watch as more films are delayed into the latter half of 2021. Films like &lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more have seen their release dates relegated to October 2021 and beyond, with &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;moving in 2022. Industry insiders predict that other major films slated for the first half of 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example — will also likely move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6Ungw"&gt;Studios looking to hit the magical $1 billion box office revenue number likely see no upside to releasing movies in a market where theaters are either entirely closed or operating at a limited capacity. AMC Theatres currently has 438 of its 593 theaters in the US open as of January 21st, according to public documents. Theaters that remain closed, however, exist in some of the United States’ most important major markets, including New York City and Los Angeles. As such, AMC Theatres reported an overall attendance decline of 92.3 percent compared to 2019, according to public documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GcCaj"&gt;Other films that studios are less positive will come with a guaranteed return on investment are being sold off; Netflix just acquired &lt;em&gt;The Mitchells vs. The Machines&lt;/em&gt;, an animated film formerly called &lt;em&gt;Connected &lt;/em&gt;that’s directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, from Sony. While the theater chains and studios struggle to figure out when they can start ushering people into theater seats to watch films, streamers like Netflix continue to thrive as people try to find new things to watch while being forced to remain home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICpS0D"&gt;Since everything is up in the air — that’s according to AMC executives — the actual runway of time that the additional cash raised will buy the company is dependent on “future attendance levels.” Future attendance levels are based on a couple of different criteria, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WSGEUX"&gt;vaccination rollout around the world, but especially in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mS9j5W"&gt;government orders regarding restrictions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DOAb7C"&gt;consumer behavior in a post-pandemic world &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="k0U8Mf"&gt;Cities like Paris, Toronto, and London have set heavier lockdown restrictions as COVID-19 cases rise, meaning that nonessential outings like going to the movies simply aren’t possible. In the United States, cities like Los Angeles and New York City have prevented movie theaters from opening since the pandemic began and, as cases rise, may continue to prevent nonessential gatherings. If a large portion of the population is vaccinated by summer, things may change, but it’s unclear if the United States will hit those goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCKnHE"&gt;Then there’s consumer behavior. This is an element of post-pandemic life that studios like Disney have warned their own shareholders about. Will people feel comfortable sitting in packed theaters with strangers again, hearing people sneeze and cough, especially during the winter months? Disney executives told shareholders they can’t predict that, but it’s something that AMC Theatres executives are also likely thinking about as they try to wrangle more cash from shareholders to stay afloat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjQEq8"&gt;For now, however, AMC has a future in front of it — at least for a little while longer. Like everything these days, it’s all dependent on what happens next. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-896" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426167398815626" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Currently, the lowest price is $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426265427578073" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If those deals sell out, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$220 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426359423842282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$235 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>WWE will move its streaming service to Peacock in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPAlYFtwlk46uVPUgB5RFpwxBUc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716569/acastro_190909_1777_wwe_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ekoJQS"&gt;WWE Network, the standalone video service from World Wrestling Entertainment, won’t be going it alone for much longer — at least in the United States. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peacock-to-become-the-exclusive-home-of-wwe-network-in-the-us-301213995.html"&gt;WWE and NBCUniversal announced&lt;/a&gt; that the service, which offers live streams of pay-per-view events, a large roster of original shows, and a massive vault of past WWE programming, will be integrated into &lt;a href="https://imp.i305175.net/c/482924/828265/11640?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2Fwatch%2Fhome&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; starting in March. The US version of the WWE Network app will be shut down as part of the deal, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nbcuniversals-peacock-to-become-wwes-exclusive-streaming-home-11611578690"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is putting at over $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMRx7j"&gt;The new tag team results in positives on both sides: WWE will find itself with a wider streaming audience after seemingly hitting a ceiling on WWE Network growth, and Peacock gets a differentiator in the direct-to-consumer streaming wars. For people that currently have both services, well, this move will be a rare case where streaming gets &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMGOZs"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuuyCz"&gt;Peacock will launch WWE Network on March 18th — in time for both &lt;em&gt;Fastlane&lt;/em&gt; later that month and a two-day &lt;em&gt;WrestleMania 37&lt;/em&gt; in April — and is promising to bring over all of the content to which current WWE Network subscribers have access. That’s no small migration, since we’re talking about decades’ worth of pay-per-views, weekly shows like &lt;em&gt;Monday Night Raw&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SmackDown&lt;/em&gt;, and original efforts like &lt;em&gt;Steve Austin’s Broken Skull Sessions&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LDLpu"&gt;Starting in 2022, WWE says subscribers can expect “one signature documentary annually.” In 2020, those documentaries included &lt;em&gt;Edge: The Second Mountain&lt;/em&gt; — detailing the wrestler’s return after nine years out of the ring — and &lt;em&gt;Undertaker: The Last Ride. &lt;/em&gt;Presumably smaller efforts like &lt;em&gt;WWE 24&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; will continue to come at a more regular pace. Last year, WWE launched a free tier of the network, and it seems some of that content will also be making its way to Peacock’s free plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfVYWG"&gt;The “WWE Network” branding will remain present on Peacock. WWE Network will be available on both Peacock’s premium ($4.99 per month) and ad-free ($9.99) plans, so current subscribers of the wrestling service, which costs $9.99 monthly, will actually be saving money if they opt for the $4.99 option. WWE and NBCUniversal will share more details on the transition closer to the March 18th date. I’m very curious about how this will all come together in the Peacock app in terms of UX. Will WWE fans have to navigate through a bunch of screens to reach whatever pay-per-view they want to watch?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon announced WWE Network at CES 2014.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eYprwy"&gt;The 24/7 WWE Network was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/9/5292638/stone-cold-stunner-wwe-network-could-be-the-start-of-the-a-la-carte"&gt;launched at CES 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Its biggest selling point was the inclusion of live pay-per-view events — something fans would normally pay $50 or $60 a pop for — as part of the much cheaper monthly subscription. The service underwent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20857446/wwe-network-streaming-redesign-george-barrios-interview-disney-price-subscription-downloads"&gt;a major redesign in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Subscriber totals have typically peaked around the company’s marquee &lt;em&gt;WrestleMania&lt;/em&gt; event each year and then tapered off in other months. It ended the third quarter of 2020 with 1.549 million subscribers. The service has &lt;a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2018/04-09-2018-204506063"&gt;eclipsed 2 million customers at times&lt;/a&gt; but has never managed to maintain that base. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RHmUz"&gt;By comparison, Peacock has already reached &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21539909/peacock-22-million-users-comcast-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;nearly 22 million users&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear how many of those are paying subscribers. Either way, WWE no longer has to sweat its streaming numbers now that WWE Network will be just one part of Peacock. WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon had previously said he was open to shaking up the company’s streaming model if the right deal came along. And chief revenue officer Nick Khan essentially telegraphed this move back in October, saying “we still believe in the potential for a transaction that enables WWE to reach a larger audience and realize a greater economic return.” He added that WWE was “in constant dialogue with companies domestically and globally about potentially licensing the network to them.” And now here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7z60E8"&gt;There will be no changes to the international version of WWE Network, which will continue operating as it does today. The WWE Network deal is separate from WWE’s big-money TV contracts with NBCUniversal (for &lt;em&gt;Monday Night Raw&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;NXT&lt;/em&gt;) and Fox, which airs &lt;em&gt;SmackDown Live&lt;/em&gt; on Friday nights. Episodes of all those shows will available on WWE Network after their normal TV window. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8BitDo’s Arcade Stick is a sleek and stylish Switch controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2epiQHUrSGCvmKCXV_EJm0EvL90=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716302/DSCF7480.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YG7WsT"&gt;8BitDo is best known for its affordable retro controllers, but its latest product is quite a bit more ambitious. It’s a wireless arcade stick for the Nintendo Switch and PCs, simply called the &lt;a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/arcade-stick/"&gt;8BitDo Arcade Stick&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GJC5WSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89.99&lt;/a&gt; it’s now the most expensive controller in the company’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2noo6"&gt;Arcade sticks can be pretty pricey, though. Hori sells a $199.99 PlayStation-licensed PS4 model, for example, so 8BitDo is still at the more accessible end of the market if you do want an arcade stick. And if you do want one for the PC or Switch, I think this one is actually a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DAvLS"&gt;8BitDo’s stick is specifically designed for the Switch and PC (via XInput), and it manages to feel native to both platforms thanks to a neat little trick: the button labels are red LEDs that switch on and off depending on where you’re playing. Turn the knob at the top left of the stick and the labels you don’t need will disappear. It looks cool and makes the stick easier to use, which makes it a pretty inspired decision in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S7CvDmx8vAPl9nHNRsjTldBkJRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22252121/5_Dynamic_Button_Layout__1_.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iGLeQA"&gt;The stick’s visual design otherwise comes off like the offspring of a NES Advantage controller and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/29/2523087/status-symbols-teenage-engineering-op-1"&gt;Teenage Engineering OP-1 synthesizer&lt;/a&gt;, with its gray, red, and black color scheme offset by round colored buttons in the corner. It’s quite small, as arcade sticks go, but it feels hefty and well-built. And while the compact size and wireless connectivity make it easy to pack away, the design is sleek enough that it could happily sit on a coffee table for a while. (At least it could on mine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkB6Or"&gt;There are three ways to connect the stick: a 2.4GHz USB dongle, Bluetooth, and a USB-C cable. The dongle can be stored in a door at the back of the stick, which is a helpful touch. Hardcore fighting game enthusiasts wouldn’t dream of using a wireless stick in competition, so the wired functionality is very welcome, but I found wireless performance to be fine for casual play. Battery life is good in wireless modes, too — 8BitDo says you should get 40 hours with the dongle and 30 hours with Bluetooth, and I haven’t needed to recharge the stick since unboxing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFPZcE"&gt;In terms of feel, 8BitDo’s stick isn’t quite up there with the most high-end options, as you’d expect for the price, but it’s still very playable. The micro-switched stick is reassuringly clicky and the buttons feel solid, plus you have the ability to swap them out if you feel like diving into the rabbit hole of stick customization. My one complaint is that I’m used to bigger sticks and tend to grip from the side, so I sometimes found my (admittedly big) left hand “slouching” on the edge of the boxy chassis, which wasn’t too comfortable. But it did at least encourage me to improve my “&lt;a href="https://www.profightstick.com/how-to-hold-a-fightstick/"&gt;broomstick&lt;/a&gt;” grip technique. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrzjYsS17dhIQAys1u5peyNskWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22252123/DSCF7488.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hcW6uK"&gt;I used the stick to play various arcade-style games, mostly fighting games like &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&lt;/em&gt;, as well as some scrolling shooters like &lt;em&gt;Ikaruga&lt;/em&gt;. Did it make me any better at any of these games? Well, no, but I had more fun playing them than I would with a controller. While arcade sticks aren’t for everyone, there are some types of games that I’ll always prefer to use one with, and 8BitDo’s Arcade Stick is up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht6zYm"&gt;I really like the 8BitDo Arcade Stick, and I think it’d be a great product for most people looking for a stick for their Switch or PC. It’s relatively affordable but has a uniquely stylish design and user-friendly feature set, making it an easy way to get started in the world of arcade sticks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft mocks Apple’s doomed Touch Bar in new Surface ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MacBook Pro with Touch Bar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIsq-yfyxJcKdG89pJLVxOMEZD8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716065/jbareham_161111_1263_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W2671R"&gt;Microsoft has a habit of reigniting the Mac vs. PC conflict for its Surface ads, and this time it’s going after Apple’s Touch Bar. In a new TV commercial, aired during Sunday night’s NFL championship games, Microsoft pits Apple’s MacBook Pro against the company’s Surface Pro 7. It’s a chance for Microsoft to mock Apple’s Touch Bar in a TV commercial for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gjmpR"&gt;“Mac gave me this little bar, but why can’t they just give me a whole touchscreen?” asks a boy comparing the two laptops. That’s something that some MacBook Pro users have been calling for, or just the removal of the Touch Bar altogether. Apple is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;reportedly planning a redesign for the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; later this year, with the Touch Bar rumored to be replaced by physical function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac5d4c"&gt;Elsewhere in the ad, Microsoft tries to position the Surface Pro 7 as a gaming device. “It is a much better gaming device,” claims the ad, which is an unusual way to frame Microsoft’s popular Surface device. The Surface Pro 7 is barely capable of running the latest PC games at acceptable frame rates with its integrated Intel graphics, so it’s not the biggest selling point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z2E20"&gt;Microsoft has previously compared its Surface Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5990217/mac-vs-pc-surface-pro-3-ads"&gt;to the MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, bashed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/29/12688554/microsoft-surface-pro-4-ad-mac-vs-pc-cat-for-your-hat"&gt;Macs in general&lt;/a&gt;, and found a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/7/31/20749394/microsoft-mac-vs-pc-ad-mac-book-apple"&gt;guy named Mac Book&lt;/a&gt; to tell people to get a Surface Laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUJj90"&gt;This latest ad also focuses on the older Surface Pro 7, which has now been replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218445/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-features-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus for businesses and schools&lt;/a&gt; at least. The new model includes a bigger battery, Intel’s 11th Gen processors, a removable SSD, and LTE. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix update makes your Android phone’s crappy speakers sound better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2tF7h2CHETDfJ137aam32T_j2Ng=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716063/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P2gEyW"&gt;Netflix has detailed an upgrade to its Android app which should reduce buffering and make audio sound better and easier to hear over background noise. It’s been made possible thanks to the adoption of the xHE-AAC codec, which a &lt;a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/optimizing-the-aural-experience-on-android-devices-with-xhe-aac-c27714292a33"&gt;Netflix blog post&lt;/a&gt; says should “improve intelligibility in noisy environments, adapt to variable cellular connections, and scale to studio-quality.” Netflix’s use of the codec was &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005751/en/Netflix-Now-Streaming-with-Fraunhofer%E2%80%99s-xHE-AAC-Audio-on-Android-Mobile"&gt;announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, and is available on devices running Android 9 and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDxbM4"&gt;xHE-AAC uses metadata to solve a few different audio problems people have when watching shows on mobile devices. Netflix explains this is often a problem of loud background noise making content hard to hear, combined with weak and tinny phone speakers that sound bad when you try to put up the volume. Inconsistent dialogue levels also mean you have to constantly turn your volume up and down between shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClCKiR"&gt;Netflix says xHE-AAC offers better Dynamic Range Control, a technology that reduces the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of a show. Quiet content is made louder so you can hear it over background noise, and the volume of loud content is brought down to prevent clipping, all in theory without sacrificing audio quality. Netflix also says that the volume of dialogue is kept consistent between shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbXuVML71dwTBKCurWxItaXWyMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22257742/0_HHM3UHqj5R094k8r.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before: The volume of dialogue levels (the black bars) are inconsistent, and wide dynamic range means content gets quiet and potentially hard to hear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8GKNOQD_Wf14iTJUNMD24sx3Cok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22257741/0_rrskjciygUhk2FpN.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After: Dynamic range reduced, so audio can’t get too quiet or too loud, and dialogue volume normalized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHZODC"&gt;Finally, the codec also supports “seamless bitrate switching,” which means it should work better in environments with inconsistent internet speeds. Netflix added similar adaptive bitrate functionality to its TV apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525492/netflix-high-quality-audio-bitrate-scaling-kbps-dolby-atmos-5-1"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc70UD"&gt;Netflix says that user testing has demonstrated the benefits of the codec. Volume changes between content are “noticeably down” and viewers switch away from using their phone’s built-in speakers 7 percent less often with the new codec. Netflix says it hopes to bring the codec to other platforms that support it. For those keeping track, iPhones have supported xHE-AAC &lt;a href="https://www.audioblog.iis.fraunhofer.com/adaptive-bitrate-audiocodec-xheaac-apple-amazon-android"&gt;since the release of iOS 13&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
