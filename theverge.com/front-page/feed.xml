    <title>T-Mobile is rolling out a new ‘5G UC’ icon for iPhones to tell when you have real 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/trrIzyhQcMhRtojb8X5MdWnBIQo=/0x19:934x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860859/Screen_Shot_2021_09_15_at_8.24.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qe3Npq"&gt;5G branding is going to get even more confusing, soon: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481"&gt;T-Mobile has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be rolling out a new “5G UC” icon on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;upcoming iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; lineup to let customers know when they’re connected to T-Mobile’s “5G Ultra Capacity” network, instead of the regular old 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qF9MYF"&gt;The difference here is one of bands and brands: at T-Mobile, an unadorned “5G” icon will soon refer to the company’s low-band network, which it calls “5G Extended Range.” As the name suggests, it’s a slower network (closer to legacy LTE speeds) but it reaches a broader area. From a spectrum perspective, it exists in largely the same areas as LTE but uses 5G technologies and techniques for improved speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gO6qtH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mnPKuN"&gt;A “5G UC” icon, though, will mean that you’re either connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325857/t-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range"&gt;T-Mobile’s mid-band network&lt;/a&gt; (which it inherited from Sprint as part of the major merger between the two companies) or its high-band mmWave network (branded as “5G Ultra Capacity”) — both of which offer dramatically faster speeds. As &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;’s annual 5G speed test&lt;/a&gt; showed this year, that mid-band coverage in particular (hitting the sweet spot of speed increase and range) has been a big contributor toward T-Mobile’s vastly improved network offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="58JHWy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPhone13Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPhone13Pro&lt;/a&gt; will let &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TMobile&lt;/a&gt; customers know when they are in an area with⚡️  fast speeds with Ultra Capacity 5G!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just keep an eye out for the below icon.   users will see it more and more as we continue to rapidly roll out this   spectrum combo. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EirfCk8pjl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EirfCk8pjl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neville (@NevilleRay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NevilleRay/status/1437854783184916481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p4LJqy"&gt;And while yet another 5G brand standard is confusing, it’s not without precedent. Verizon has been differentiating between its low-band 5G (also called “5G”) and its mmWave coverage (“5G UW,” or ultra-wideband) since it started rolling out those networks years ago. AT&amp;amp;T does something similar, too, referring to low-band 5G as “5G,” while its mmWave networks are “5G Plus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240QJO"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also has the unfortunate tendency to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;misleadingly refer to its LTE networks as “5G E,”&lt;/a&gt; which, unlike the other flavors of 5G on this list, is not actually 5G at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj1rXT"&gt;But T-Mobile’s change is arguably a necessary one: the rush to sell customers on 5G and slap the next-generation networking’s branding everywhere has meant that the low-band networks most people currently experience as “5G” is actually fairly similar — practically speaking — to LTE. But now that carriers are actually rolling out the bigger improvements that do bring meaningful speed and latency increases, they’re caught in a problem of their own devising: regular “5G” is too diluted of a brand to make an impact, hence the more bombastic ultras and pluses being appended to icons and logos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39Qhap"&gt;The new 5G UC icons should start rolling out soon on the iPhone 13 models once they’re released, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/po9aqn/tmobile_to_add_5g_uc_icon_to_iphone_13_when_in/hcvei91/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;last year’s iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t count on resurrected woolly mammoths to combat climate change </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Co-founders of Colossal, Ben Lamm (L), CEO and Dr. George Church (R), PhD&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gtiY-rKHjRtyGbfHxx8Xznuw_4k=/351x0:3194x1895/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860830/ben_george.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Co-founders of Colossal, Ben Lamm (L), CEO and George Church (R) | Image: Business Wire&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlhoVw"&gt;A flashy new biotech startup &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210913005498/en/Woolly-Mammoths-Will-Walk-the-Arctic-Tundra-Again-New-Biosciences-and-Genetics-Company-Colossal-Pioneers-Animal-De-Extinction-Technology-to-Help-Restore-Lost-Ecosystems-and-Help-Ensure-a-Habitable-Planet"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; yesterday called Colossal is on a mission to make an elephant-woolly mammoth mashup — with the ultimate goal of promoting biodiversity and combating climate change, it says. The effort has gotten a lot of hype and big-name backers, but scientists who work in conservation are still pretty skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4ex5Sw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The science behind Colossal is in very early stages and is mired in ethical quandaries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdiwHx"&gt;The science behind Colossal is in very early stages and is mired in ethical quandaries. The company won’t actually bring back a woolly mammoth, which hasn’t roamed the Earth in about 10,000 years. Instead, Colossal’s de-extinction effort aims to create a hybrid between a woolly mammoth and its distant relative (the two share a common ancestor): the Asian elephant, which itself is an endangered species. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7UMzx"&gt;Mammoths are a poor choice for de-extinction — a field of research that has picked up steam in recent years — and this project might steal the spotlight from more important conservation efforts, ecologists and biologists tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The woolly mammoth’s pseudo-resurrection is also a risky proposal as a fix for climate change, experts say, given the short timeline humanity has to slash greenhouse gas emissions that have given Earth a fever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyNclV"&gt;“I guess I confess, the five-year-old in me would just love to see a mammoth,” says Joseph Bennett, an assistant professor at the Institute of Environmental Science and Department of Biology at Carleton University. “It’s just fascinating from a scientific standpoint. But if it’s called conservation, and if it’s called fighting climate change, that’s when the problems arise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hJZtQj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How de-extinction might work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PIUoj2"&gt;Imagine a furrier, fatter elephant with smaller ears and a high-domed head. That’s what Colossal might one day create using CRISPR technology to edit the DNA of an Asian elephant to introduce traits from woolly mammoths. Over the next four years or so, the aim is to produce embryos with those traits by building off the work of Harvard geneticist George Church, a co-founder of the company. To create the embryo, they might harvest eggs from an elephant or try to create stem cells using elephant tissue. Colossal also wants to create an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/science/colossal-woolly-mammoth-DNA.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;artificial uterus&lt;/a&gt; to carry the embryo, which would take about two years to develop into a 200-pound fetus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="v3BEGh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine a furrier, fatter elephant with smaller ears and a high-domed head&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WCyQz"&gt;Church and his team of researchers have been working toward that goal for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4119062/can-deextinction-bring-back-the-mammoth-passenger-pigeon-thylacine"&gt;about a decade&lt;/a&gt;, and said &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/wooly-mammoth-will-not-be-resurrected-in-two-years/"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that it was just a couple of years away from creating the embryo. But Church’s team, until now, has lacked the funding to make that happen, according to Colossal co-founder and CEO and tech entrepreneur Ben Lamm. Colossal’s investors, which include private equity firms and self-help guru Tony Robbins, will infuse the project with $15 million. That builds on a previous $100,000 contribution from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that Church’s team received before Colossal was founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3WULY"&gt;If all that funding ultimately results in a real-life Asian elephant-mammoth hybrid, there will still be a lot of ecological and ethical questions with which to grapple. Colossal bills itself as an effort to tackle biodiversity loss. Earth is probably losing a species or more a day, according to Bennett. There is evidence of a &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-mass-extinction-and-are-we-facing-a-sixth-one.html"&gt;mass extinction&lt;/a&gt; taking place, the likes of which hasn’t been seen on Earth for millions of years. When it comes to protecting biodiversity on our planet, resurrecting a prehistoric creature is low on the priority list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9Z815"&gt;“Even within endangered species that we want to keep from going extinct, we have to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22584103/biodiversity-species-conservation-debate"&gt;prioritize&lt;/a&gt; what are the winners and the losers,” says Ginger Allington, a landscape ecologist and assistant professor at George Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f6nUn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Even within endangered species that we want to keep from going extinct, we have to &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.vox.com/22584103/biodiversity-species-conservation-debate" target="_blank"&gt;prioritize&lt;/a&gt; what are the winners and the losers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QV7ZYO"&gt;Funding de-extinction could hurt other conservation efforts by siphoning off limited resources, Bennett’s previous &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/news/2017/02/bringing-extinct-species-back-dead-could-hurt-not-help-conservation-efforts"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found. Spending the same amount of money on traditional conservation efforts could save up to eight times more species than if the money was to be spent on de-extinction. The Asian elephant itself could use help; its numbers have &lt;a href="https://www.asesg.org/PDFfiles/Asian%20Elephant%20Red%20List%20Assessment%202020.pdf"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; in half over the past three generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iENag5"&gt;Lamm believes Colossal’s work might benefit the elephants and draw more attention to other conservation efforts. “We’re trying to make sure that we do this in the most transparent and ethical way as possible,” Lamm tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We feel very confident about what we can do to help the elephant lineage … For us it’s about giving the species additional tools to survive.” An elephant with mammoth traits would be better able to survive in the Arctic’s cold temperatures, away from urbanization that threatens its species, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgJXLp"&gt;But Asian elephants’ home is tropical South and Southeast Asia. They’re also highly intelligent and social animals that form tight-knit groups. “They have a culture,” Bennett says. All that raises “major” ethical questions for Bennett over whether a mammoth-elephant hybrid would be able to behaviorally manage being transplanted in a new home that’s vastly different from where elephant species currently live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="m9F2rh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feat of mammoth proportions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YtEjT0"&gt;Even a full-fledged woolly mammoth might struggle to adapt to the Arctic as it is today. “If you were to take a piece from a whole system like a Model T, say a piston, and you were to wait even 100 years and then try to integrate that into a Tesla — that won’t fit because the rest of the system has completely moved on and changed dramatically,” says Douglas McCauley, an ecologist and associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5cwqr"&gt;Colossal thinks the animals could essentially re-engineer ecosystems, turning mossy tundra back to grasslands that once thrived with mammoths’ help 10,000 years ago. Without mammoths, grasslands where they roamed were slowly replaced by moss and trees. That poses problems for the planet because snow-covered grasslands in the Arctic are better at reflecting radiation from the sun than darker shrublands or woodlands. Bringing herds back could theoretically reverse that trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e05h77"&gt;The hybrid animals might also help prevent permafrost (soil that’s frozen year-round) from melting, which releases old stores of planet-heating carbon dioxide. A father-son pair of ecologists in Russia have tried using bison, reindeer, and other animals to achieve something similar in Siberia in a place called “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/pleistocene-park/517779/"&gt;Pleistocene Park&lt;/a&gt;.” The hope is that the animals — perhaps one day with the help of elephant-mammoth hybrids — will trample down snow and make it easier for the soil so to freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jh5vAX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The animal could become a sort of “eco-zombie” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9MCZFV"&gt;But for Colossal to be able to fulfill its goals, it would need to ensure that there are enough of the animals to do the job that mammoths once did. Otherwise, the animal could become a sort of “eco-zombie” that doesn’t meaningfully participate in its ecosystem as it once did, as McCauley and other authors describe in their 2017 &lt;a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.12728"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; about how to prioritize species for de-extinction efforts. Choosing animals that have recently gone extinct, or are on the verge of extinction, are better candidates, that paper said. They should also be species that perform a unique function or job in its ecosystem, and that can bounce back to big enough numbers to be able to effectively do that job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVG7Sk"&gt;One promising route for de-extinction research is research into breeding coral that are more resilient to a warming world — potentially saving them from extinction. It’s an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03629-7#ref-CR1"&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; that could support fisheries and shield coastal communities around the world from storm surge. Unless greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero by the middle of the century, the planet is on track to reach a level of global warming that would essentially wipe out the world’s coral reefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Xe3d6"&gt;There are other problems that could keep grasslands from coming back. The pH of the soil has become more acidic. There’s also a risk that new animals might disturb soil too much, so that it actually exposes permafrost to melting faster. Whether the animals protect or perturb existing permafrost depends partly on their behavior — which at this point is still a big unknown, as they do not exist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD85hc"&gt;“Scaling the effect from the small herd scale to the entire permafrost zone which impacts climate also seems futuristic rather than something that can help anytime soon, even if it did help at all,” Ted Schuur, regents’ professor of ecosystem ecology at Northern State University wrote to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B9wfVV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“futuristic rather than something that can help anytime soon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0Z2PG"&gt;Even if everything goes as planned for Colossal, Lamm thinks it would take about six years to birth a hybrid calf. Then it would take another fourteen years or so for their first animal to be old enough to reproduce. From there, the efforts would need to scale up massively to have any meaningful effect on the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. But even that best-case scenario comes too late for urgent climate goals. It’s nowhere near soon enough to help save coral reefs, which will need global emissions to drop by half by the end of the decade if they are to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEKd35"&gt;To tackle the climate crisis, the world needs deep and immediate cuts to greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. Climate action ought to focus on addressing that pollution that’s at the root of the climate crisis, Bennett says, and not on projects that have a massive profile and an uncertain impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saRVDm"&gt;“My big concern with these things is that investors will be looking to offset their climate footprint, and they’ll look for things to do and somebody will look at something like that and be like, ‘Oh this is cool,’” says Bennett. “It’s a highly, highly risky prospect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVadSM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hcmB0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it every year, but the iPhone 13 cameras do seem much improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7u5nyjXL1Lj3DAf27mMr4pPXV8=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860644/i13p2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPEBtq"&gt;Cameras continue to be one of the biggest differentiators in smartphones, and Apple’s iPhone lineup is no different. Apple says the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the company’s “most advanced dual-camera system ever,” while the 13 Pro and Pro Max have “our three most powerful cameras ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dWYGH"&gt;Which you’d hope for, of course. But this year, Apple really does appear to be making a big push with its cameras, particularly with the Pro models. As ever, the question will be what Apple is able to wring out of its hardware with image processing and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQGoWi"&gt;The iPhone 13 lineup represents the first time Apple has increased the primary camera’s sensor size across the board since the iPhone XS and XR in 2018, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21515571/iphone-12-pro-max-camera-quality-features"&gt;last year’s 12 Pro Max had a 47 percent bigger sensor&lt;/a&gt; than the 12 and 12 Pro. Sensor size is a key factor in image quality because, together with lens aperture, it determines how much light the camera is able to capture. More light, less noise and blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tK52o"&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini’s main cameras have bigger sensors, which is part of the reason why it and the ultrawide are now arranged diagonally in the camera bump. Apple also added sensor-shift optical image stabilization, a feature first seen on the 12 Pro Max. It’s not clear exactly how big the 13’s sensor is, but Apple says it’ll capture 47 percent more light than the 12. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEUG2VZhfv8_aShe9BOhPHTybhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852177/i13p.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nyxfXN"&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have a even bigger primary sensor and slightly faster f/1.5 lens that capture 2.2 times as much light as before, according to Apple. Again, the exact sensor size hasn’t been advertised, but Apple did give the pixel size: it’s 1.9μm, which is bigger than any modern smartphone I’m aware of. Apple can do this because the sensor is a relatively low-resolution 12 megapixels, but it’s still an impressive stat that should translate to better low-light performance. For comparison, the 12 Pro Max had 1.7μm pixels, while every other iPhone since the XS has had 1.4μm pixels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="52XSSS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple isn’t outgunning Android phones on hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2R1t8"&gt;It’s not clear exactly what hardware changes Apple has made to the iPhone 13’s ultrawide camera; the company simply says it has a “faster sensor” that “reveals more detail in the dark areas of your photos.” The Pro does have significant hardware tweaks, though, since Apple has increased the aperture to f/1.8 for a 92-percent improvement in light-gathering capability. The sensor also now has focus pixels on board — things are rarely out of focus in ultrawide shots because the depth of field is so large, but adding autofocus means that the camera can be used for macro photography, with a focusing distance of 2cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rwrb4"&gt;The telephoto camera remains exclusive to the 13 Pro phones, and Apple has increased its equivalent focal length to 77mm, or three times longer than the primary camera. Previously the iPhone 12 Pro’s telephoto offered 2x zoom while the 12 Pro Max went out to 2.5x. There’s a tradeoff here — if you want to frame something with 2x zoom, the 13 Pro will need to crop in from the main camera, reducing image quality. But your pictures that go beyond 3x zoom will be much sharper than before, and it should make for a better portrait lens. Apple has also added Night mode to the telephoto for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J64QBL"&gt;When compared to the Android competition, Apple isn’t doing much to outgun them on the hardware front. The large 1.9μm pixels are noteworthy, but most Android phone makers have been prioritizing big, high-resolution sensors rather than pure pixel size. Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra, for example, has a huge 50-megapixel sensor with 1.4μm pixels, meaning it has decent light-gathering ability even when shot at native resolution without binning the pixels together. And while the 3x telephoto lens is going to be useful, it’s now common to see 5x periscope telephotos (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21444946/huawei-p40-pro-plus-vs-iphone-pixel-10x-zoom-camera"&gt;or occasionally even 10x&lt;/a&gt;) in the Android world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMDyp54O2X93mx0f_YJVBUgkqvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852176/camera_system__f9pkhq4g2oy2_large_2x.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYXY1o"&gt;So even though Apple has made meaningful hardware improvements across the iPhone 13 lineup, as ever its performance relative to competitors will come down to how well its software and image processing pipeline has been optimized. The iPhone 11 was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;hugely better camera&lt;/a&gt; than the XS the year before it, after all, even though the hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/11/20860442/apple-iphone-11-camera-analysis-competition"&gt;barely changed&lt;/a&gt;. This year Apple is touting Smart HDR 4, which is capable of individually adjusting exposure for multiple people in the frame, but we’ll have to see the phones for ourselves to know what kind of a difference that makes. The same goes for Photographic Styles, a new filter-like feature that Apple says is smarter about adjusting elements like skin tones and skies in each photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIuJtD"&gt;As for video, Apple is making a big deal out of its Cinematic mode that lets you selectively adjust focus and depth of field when post-processing, like Portrait mode for photos. That’s something we’ll definitely have to test extensively. The 13 Pro, meanwhile, lets you record and edit video in Apple’s ProRes codec on the phone itself, or you can export the ProRes file to Final Cut Pro on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccov7C"&gt;All the usual caveats about waiting for full reviews most certainly still apply, but this is looking like a pretty good year for the iPhone camera. Apple is never going to have the flashiest hardware, but it’s made some welcome improvements in areas that make sense, and thankfully it hasn’t locked any features to the Max-sized iPhone. We’re looking forward to seeing the results — as well as those of looming competitors like the Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG now makes a 2,000 pound TV that costs $1.7 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jKwClmLHvAawzeuLaPOcrxZ8v8=/1x0:1075x716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860628/8K_UltraHDmain.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less “big TV” more “projector replacement.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bz2a6b"&gt;LG has announced a new lineup of Direct View LED (DVLED) home cinema displays, which range in size from a huge 108-inch HD screen to an obscene 325-inch 8K panel that costs an eye-watering $1.7 million, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/lgs-outrageous-direct-view-led-tv-tops-out-at-335-inches-1-7-million/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and weighs in at over 2,000 pounds. The company has previously reserved these displays for commercial buyers, but now it’ll sell them to anyone with pockets deep enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYtN53"&gt;Obviously, these screen sizes mean the home theater displays aren’t going to fit in a lot of houses, a limitation that’s likely to have a lot to do with the display technology they’re using. Rather than using an LCD layer to create pixels, and lighting it with separate LEDs, these displays just use LEDs (with some using smaller MicroLEDs, according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;), similar to what we’ve seen from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677384/samsung-the-wall-luxury-8k-micro-led-modular-size-292-inches-2k-73-inches"&gt;Samsung’s The Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217554/sony-selling-microled-production-display-mandalorian-production"&gt;Sony’s Crystal LED lineup&lt;/a&gt;. This has the advantage of creating better contrast levels like what you’d see from an OLED display, because individual pixels can turn off entirely to create deeper black levels, without the risk of burn-in. But the challenge with this approach is making LEDs small enough to work as individual subpixels, hence why these early DVLED screens are so dang big. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZDxHUz86mkkf1TcW2iZfOCTXaBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852149/4k_UHD_393.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ultrawide version for the multi-taskers in your household.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cQtXt1"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; points out, it’s better to think of LG’s new DVLED displays as a replacement for a high-end projector that can already create an image of 100-inches or larger. Obviously a DVLED is a lot more expensive, but you’re left with a screen that gets bright enough to use in a well-lit room, unlike the dungeons that most projectors prefer. Peak brightness output for most of these LG screens sits at 1,200 nits, which is comparable to a regular high-end TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0xhxX"&gt;Most of the screens are offered in a regular 16:9 aspect ratio, but LG is also selling 32:9 versions in case you want to watch two video feeds side by side (or perhaps watch a film while you grind for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;loot). In case you needed any more reassurances about how expensive this display is, LG will ship it to you in a full-on flight case, which even the company admits is “overkill.” All in all, it’s a package that almost starts to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577063/lg-oled-r-rollable-tv-us-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;LG’s $100,000 rollable OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; look reasonable in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VF4wbq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGNVfE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford, Argo, and Walmart are bringing robo-delivery to three US cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIW1XfGy_OI49ht9LXomPHxH77M=/68x0:3935x2578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860575/Argo_Walmart_exterior_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;(Photo by Jared Wickerham/Argo AI)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Frz4iL"&gt;Ford and Walmart are teaming to launch a robo-delivery service in three US cities, using autonomous test vehicles equipped with sensors and software developed by Argo AI. Customers who live in Miami, Austin, and Washington, DC, who order items from Walmart online and live within a specific geographic area may be eligible to have their items delivered by a Ford/Argo vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s43qoq"&gt;The companies plan on kicking off “integration testing” for the delivery service this year, with plans to expand the geographic areas over time. Autonomous delivery is seen as a potentially lucrative market, with online grocery shopping growing fivefold over the next decade and American consumers spending upward of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according to a recent report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPIfHn"&gt;Ford has been experimenting with robo-delivery for a number of years now. In 2018, it announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18087898/ford-walmart-postmates-self-driving-grocery-delivery-miami"&gt;grocery delivery pilot with Walmart and Postmates&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker also helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16213544/dominos-ford-pizza-self-driving-car"&gt;Domino’s deliver pizza&lt;/a&gt; using its autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hfPhNQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford has been experimenting with robo-delivery for a number of years now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hknh0v"&gt;There are still a lot of hurdles to work out. The vehicles will require human monitors, both behind the wheel as well as from remote command centers, so any potential labor savings would still be years away. Customers would have to retrieve their deliveries from the vehicles, which could pose problems for elderly and disabled customers, as well as people who live in apartment buildings and are accustomed to delivery workers bringing their orders to their door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGIc8m"&gt;Ford isn’t the only company that’s trying to work through these challenges. Cruise, which is backed by General Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557603/cruise-walmart-autonomous-vehicles-delivery-arizona"&gt;has its own pilot project with Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona. In fact, the retail giant is hedging its bets by forging non-exclusive partnerships with a wide-range of AV operators, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004678/nuros-driverless-delivery-robots-walmart-houston"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611760/waymo-walmart-self-driving-vehicles-groceries-discounts"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65AUNZ"&gt;Delivery is just one aspect of Ford’s plan to commercialize autonomous vehicles. The automaker recently announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585764/ford-argo-lyft-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi-miami-austin"&gt;partnering with Lyft&lt;/a&gt; to deploy robotaxis in the same three cities before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlMzcM"&gt;In addition to Austin, Miami, and DC, Ford and Argo have been testing their fourth-generation vehicles in Pittsburgh, Detroit, and California. Argo is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany"&gt;preparing to launch an autonomous micro-transit and delivery service with VW&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, using its fifth-generation autonomous technology, starting in 2025. The AV company is rumored to be mulling an initial public offering at a $12.4 billion valuation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram internal research: ‘We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oeXfEhNnF5b8l5SnyozM2_fyfB0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860490/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZPVQGv"&gt;How bad is Instagram for the mental health of its younger users? It’s a hugely important question, especially with Facebook planning to launch a version of the app for children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AI2TBp"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests the answer is “pretty bad,” based on internal research conducted by Facebook that it’s been unwilling to share with the public. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;recently&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;got access to these in-depth studies, which paint a bleak picture of the detrimental effects Instagram has on its younger users, particularly teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMysGL"&gt;For this latter group, Instagram is a powerful engine for “social comparison” — when one judges one’s own value, attractiveness, and success based on comparisons with others. Teenage girls are often blasted with images of idealized bodies on Instagram, appearing as adverts, images in their feeds, and content in the app’s Explore page. This often has a negative affect on these users’ mental health. As one slide from an internal Facebook presentation put it: “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” (The figure referred to teenagers who already reported body image issues of some type.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gqWzk"&gt;The report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;worth reading in full&lt;/a&gt;, but here are some highlights from Facebook’s internal research into the effect Instagram has on younger users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="P0HCzB"&gt;One study by Facebook of teen Instagram users in the US and UK found that more than 40 percent of those who reported feeling “unattractive” said the feelings started when using Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LLn2j4"&gt;Research reviewed by Facebook’s top executives concluded that Instagram was engineered towards greater “social comparison” than rival apps like TikTok and Snapchat. TikTok is more focused on performance and Snapchat on jokey filters that “keep the focus on the face.” Instagram, by comparison, spotlights users’ bodies and lifestyles more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZRCFio"&gt;Teens told Facebook’s researchers that they felt “addicted” to Instagram and wanted to check it less often, but didn’t have the self-control to rein in their usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="azEpSu"&gt;“Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said internal research by Facebook presented in 2019, and that “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yO6Eay"&gt;Facebook found that among teens who said they had suicidal thoughts, 13 percent of UK users and 6 percent of US users said these impulses could be tracked back to the app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="t8S6dM"&gt;Such findings are significant in their own right, but become particularly damning for Facebook when compared with the evasiveness of its public statements. As the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, the company’s top executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have been quizzed by politicians like Senator Richard Blumenthal on the effects of its apps on younger users, but have not disclosed anything like the detailed findings created by its own internal studies. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, the company told senators that its research was proprietary and was “kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4l4Wqq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook seems to be taking a page from the textbook of Big Tobacco — targeting teens with potentially dangerous products while masking the science in public”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ySxxI4"&gt;Sen. Blumenthal told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; in an email: “Facebook’s answers were so evasive — failing to even respond to all our questions — that they really raise questions about what Facebook might be hiding [...] Facebook seems to be taking a page from the textbook of Big Tobacco —targeting teens with potentially dangerous products while masking the science in public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2C9AK"&gt;Facebook has made attempts to deal with these issues through changes to Instagram’s user interface, like an experiment to hide like counts (a metric that teens told Facebook made them anxious). But the company said this change didn’t seem to have much affect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlXE3J"&gt;“It turned out that it didn’t actually change nearly as much about … how people felt, or how much they used the experience as we thought it would,” Instagram chief Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456206/instagram-hiding-likes-experiment-results-platformer"&gt;told reporters in May&lt;/a&gt;. “But it did end up being pretty polarizing. Some people really liked it, and some people really didn’t.” Instead of rolling out the change to all users, Instagram kept like counts on by default but gave users the &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-people-more-control"&gt;option to turn them off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SGya8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Prime now includes free Deliveroo deliveries in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="UK Daily Life 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIqoTk8RCGWqDYPZ_8iakWUEv_w=/57x0:2490x1622/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860431/1320373926.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nathan Stirk/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2zN1Ny"&gt;Amazon is now offering a year of Deliveroo Plus with its Prime subscription in the UK. Amazon Prime customers will be able to access the silver tier of Deliveroo Plus free of charge, enabling free deliveries on orders over £25. Deliveroo normally charges £3.49 a month for Deliveroo Plus, making this a saving of more than £40 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snQn7r"&gt;Deliveroo Plus includes unlimited free deliveries of food from a variety of participating restaurants. You’ll either need to be eating a lot or ordering for two or more people to really take advantage of the service, though. You’ll need to hit a minimum spend of £25 or more per order to benefit from free deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpbLuk"&gt;The partnership comes more than two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18628974/amazon-deliveroo-investment-575-million-uber-eats-uk"&gt;Amazon invested in UK-based food delivery company Deliveroo&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon led a $575 million funding round in Deliveroo, which used the investment to expand its engineering team and delivery reach. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had some initial reservations about the deal, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225099/amazon-deliveroo-investment-funding-food-delivery-restaurant-industry"&gt;cleared it last year&lt;/a&gt; just as the pandemic was hammering the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYAmNq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon tried to compete with Deliveroo years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNob2p"&gt;Ahead of the investment in Deliveroo, Amazon briefly participated in the restaurant delivery wars in the UK. Amazon launched its restaurant delivery service in London in 2015, but it failed to compete with similar services like Deliveroo and UberEats. Amazon Restaurants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18112620/amazon-restaurants-delivery-uk-london-cancelled"&gt;quietly ended two years later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYAZE2"&gt;Amazon has previously included similar perks with its Prime subscription, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18284382/twitch-prime-nintendo-switch-online-service-free-amazon-subscribers"&gt;a year of Nintendo’s Switch Online service&lt;/a&gt;. If you have Amazon Prime and you’re interested in claiming the year of free Deliveroo Plus, you can link your accounts over at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=26804070031"&gt;Amazon’s site here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a new bubbles emoji that’ll go just great with the peach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfD5EeSAW2Yi7XjidCkCbNSq420=/0x3:908x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860402/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My editor put together this image disturbingly soon after I pitched this article.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Thomas Ricker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IwU0Vi"&gt;If I were an emoji sommelier, there’s one pairing I’d definitely be recommending after looking at this year’s 37-strong selection of &lt;a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2021/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-140.html"&gt;finalized emoji&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s a combination of the new “&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/bubbles/"&gt;bubbles&lt;/a&gt;” emoji with the existing “peach.” The former emoji has just been finalized with version 14.0 of the Unicode Standard, but the collection has been public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578697/new-emoji-14-0-finalists-unicode-consortium"&gt;since earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt8S7Y"&gt;The reason is simple. Peach has long pulled double duty as the internationally recognized symbol for the human butt, making “butt bubbles” an elegant euphemism for farts. Sure, you’ve long been able to tell a similar visual story by combining the peach with the gust of wind emoji (which I now see is technically called “&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dashing-away/"&gt;dashing away&lt;/a&gt;”). But now you’ve got more options. Like if you wanted to symbolize the act of emitting gas in a bath, or swimming pool, you monster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emoji shown in the prior image, in addition to a melting face, face with hand over mouth, face with eye peeking through fingers, saluting face, face with dotted lines around it, face holding back tears, as well as heart hands, snapping fingers, pointing index finger, and handshakes, all with different skin tones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwRPFh-9t83V-nILuDkvUtE7wH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719624/emojipedia_14_draft_world_emoji_day_july_2021.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw6J0F"&gt;The list, which is &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-14-0/"&gt;nicely summarized by &lt;em&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also includes new faces like “biting lip” and “saluting face.” Unfortunately for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhy-do-English-people-salute-magpies&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F15%2F22675134%2Funicode-emoji-version-14-bubbles-saluting-face-biting-lip-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;English people looking to ward off bad luck&lt;/a&gt;, there isn’t yet a magpie emoji to pair the latter with. New hand gestures include a pair of hands creating the shape of a heart, and a hand pointing towards the screen. As part of this release, handshakes between hands of different skin tones are now officially supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yo3Ufl"&gt;Finally, there are also new gender options for pregnancy, including emoji for “pregnant person” and “pregnant man.” A new “person with crown” joins the existing “prince” and “princess” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUgHkc"&gt;Now that the list of emoji has been finalized, it’s up to the major platform holders to add the designs into their software, which for most is likely to happen next year between January and August, according to &lt;em&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re interested in learning about how emoji are made, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Jay Peters was involved in the creation of this year’s “bubbles” and “saluting face” emoji, and previously submitted proposals for “yawning face” and “waffle.” You can read all about the process he went through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo finally adds Bluetooth audio to the Switch in new software update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QfbsuIF4qKyfEGGIezmG2oYo_YA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859425/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_zelda.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i8DIv7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1437930124490457088?s=20"&gt;Nintendo has surprise-announced&lt;/a&gt; that Bluetooth audio support has come to the Switch through a software update. The ability to use Bluetooth headphones to listen to game audio has been a conspicuously missing feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14237060/nintendo-switch-console-launch-date-price-announced"&gt;since the console launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s great to finally have it — though there are some limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnRnpc"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973"&gt;a Nintendo support article&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be limited to using two wireless controllers if you’ve got a Bluetooth headset attached. The system also won’t support Bluetooth microphones, which isn’t necessarily surprising given that Nintendo’s own voice chat system relies on an app running on your phone. Still, it’s a bummer for people who play games with their own built-in voice chat abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BPvUY0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt; update is now available, including the ability to pair Bluetooth devices for audio output.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information, including restrictions on some features while using Bluetooth Audio, please visit the support page: &lt;a href="https://t.co/vzAB6lZTDu"&gt;https://t.co/vzAB6lZTDu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6J5xcDl5kU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6J5xcDl5kU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1437930124490457088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DqJk5J"&gt;People have gone through great lengths to get wireless audio on their Switch (we even said that it’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;a great selling point for a Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt;): there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/13/17570350/nintendo-switch-wireless-headphones-bluetooth-audio-support-adapter"&gt;have been accessories&lt;/a&gt; that acted as Bluetooth audio adapters, and some headsets like the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;came with a dongle&lt;/a&gt; that took advantage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/20/16507816/nintendo-wireless-usb-headphones-switch-update-firmware"&gt;Switch’s support for USB wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rl2m3"&gt;Having Bluetooth audio built-in is a big deal, then — especially considering that Nintendo’s Pro Controller, unlike many others, doesn’t include a headphone jack (though it’s worth noting that the &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/ps5-xbox-series-x-how-to-use-wireless-headphones"&gt;PS5 and Xbox Series don’t natively support Bluetooth audio&lt;/a&gt;). Even with the aforementioned limitations, the feature seems to be well-supported: Nintendo says that the Switch can save up to 10 connected devices, and says that it should work with both the regular Switch and the Switch Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqRTYD"&gt;My colleague Jay Peters was able to connect his AirPods Pro to his base Switch and a Switch Lite without much trouble. In the settings menu, there’s a section for “Bluetooth Audio,” and you can pair your headphones from there by following the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zAvZt3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My colleague’s AirPods Pro worked well with WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HqUvIw"&gt;Jay’s AirPods Pro worked well in a few rounds of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22632465/warioware-get-it-together-nintendo-switch-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with no noticeable delay — something that’s particularly important for &lt;em&gt;WarioWare’s&lt;/em&gt; fast-paced, twitchy microgames. While using his base Switch, Jay also reports that after a cold boot, his AirPods Pro paired nearly instantly after selecting them again in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcEzMT"&gt;However, Sean Hollister’s second-generation Switch (not a Lite) had trouble finding and connecting to any Bluetooth devices whatsoever. He got an Arctis Pro Wireless to connect after rebooting the Switch three times, but most attempts ended in failure, including with a set of first-gen Amazon Echo Buds and Wyze Buds Pro, a Bluetooth adapter for the Bose QC25 and an LG TV set. While some of them would&lt;em&gt; sometimes&lt;/em&gt; appear available for pairing, the gaming system spit out an “Unable to find Bluetooth audio devices” message even after repeated attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYPVAs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-updates-and-change-history#current"&gt;According to the changelog&lt;/a&gt;, the update also adds some features to make wired internet more useful. The Switch will be able to stay connected to the internet even in sleep mode if it’s hardwired in, seemingly either through an adapter or the built-in LAN port on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;upcoming Nintendo Switch OLED dock&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo says that this will help the console download content while it’s asleep, and that the feature will be on by default. Oh, and also you may have to do &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55980"&gt;firmware updates&lt;/a&gt; for the dock with the built-in LAN port. I wouldn’t expect those to be as exciting as this update though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where are Apple’s new Macs? Here’s what we’re still expecting Apple to announce this year   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="It uses TouchID for biometrics. Overall the hardware is identical to the last model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b3eRLzXafQlJF-PIMmYt6XADG7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859437/vpavic_4291_20201113_0429.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5nXzy"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was packed with announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;sixth-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. We expected much of this, yet, there were a number of things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;we had anticipated&lt;/a&gt; that Apple might announce but didn’t, including new MacBook Pros and next-gen AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvt4P8"&gt;However, it looks like there’s still hope they may make an appearance soon, especially given that October is historically when Apple will showcase new Macs. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s reliable Apple-watcher, Mark Gurman, Apple will likely &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1437140403803672581"&gt;hold at least one more&lt;/a&gt; online event within the next “several weeks,” which means Apple may still reveal the no-shows from today before the end of 2021. Here are some of the more noteworthy omissions we expect to see in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cLH8qg"&gt;New MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jFiS2O"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; powered by a new &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-m1x-vs-m2-chip-what-we-know-so-far-and-what-it-means-for-new-macbooks"&gt;M1X chip&lt;/a&gt; — the rumored name for an enhanced variant of Apple’s M1 chip that made its debut last year — could make an appearance as early as next month, Gurman predicts. Rumor has it the new laptops will reportedly feature a flat-edged redesign and the return of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;magnetic MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the reintroduction of previously excised inputs like the HDMI port and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244398/apple-2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-slot-report-ports-refresh"&gt;SD card slot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7vfx8O"&gt;New Mac Minis, iMacs, and Mac Pro workstations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NkHzJz"&gt;After Apple unveils the MacBook Pro, Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;also speculates&lt;/a&gt; we may see an upgraded Mac Mini, a bigger iMac, an updated Mac Pro workstation, and even a “new low-end MacBook Pro.” Each machine will also be reportedly powered by the next generation of Apple’s in-house chips, which will “will greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to Gurman’s anonymous sources. Still, there’s no guarantee Apple will unveil these before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blmZS4"&gt;Next-gen AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XYABES"&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-apple-event-tuesday/"&gt;heavily rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would unveil the third generation of AirPods during its iPhone 13 event, so it was a huge surprise when the company didn’t. It’s possible, however, that we could still see these make their debut before the holiday season starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMWMyT"&gt;When they do arrive, the new AirPods will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;reportedly boast&lt;/a&gt; some of the most significant changes in form since their 2016 debut. It’s likely the new pair will mirror the AirPods Pro in design, with a new case and shorter stems. However, that may be where the similarities between the two end — noise cancellation, for example, may remain exclusive to the Pro model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZjAfT"&gt;The new AirPods are expected to retail anywhere between $150 and $200, and it’s not clear yet whether Apple will sell two different versions — one with and one without a wireless charging case — like it does with the current non-Pro AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j7cEfE"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GyvvHU"&gt;During Tuesday’s keynote, Apple announced that the next iteration of its smartwatch operating system, watchOS 8, will launch alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. macOS users, however, are still in the dark as to when, exactly, they might see the official release of macOS Monterey, the successor to macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wACDT6"&gt;macOS Monterey — which was first introduced as a free update during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; and has been testing in public beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;since July&lt;/a&gt; — is still presumingly set to arrive in the fall, which what’s listed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22674369%2Fapple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The update brings improvements to FaceTime, Safari, and a slew of other apps. Monterey will also introduce features such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596970/apple-macos-monterey-live-text-intel-processors"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that allows you to control and quickly move files across multiple Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUncrx"&gt;Given the lack of Mac updates during Tuesday’s event, it seems possible that Apple could announce the release date of Monterey during the rumored event in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f0QJze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the macOS Monterey public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
