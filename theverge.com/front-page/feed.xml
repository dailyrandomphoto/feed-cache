    <title>The next pro iPhone might finally ditch the notch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTwYqxvSUZFA7Cc6MW8n3z-HDfM=/0x131:1960x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883867/Apple_iPhone_13_Pro_Colors_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9vJ2u"&gt;The iPhone 13 isn’t even here yet, but speculation about Apple’s future phones never slows down. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;some rumors about Apple’s event last week didn’t pan out&lt;/a&gt;, certain leaks were right on, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;information about a smaller notch and high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDUyx8"&gt;Now Kuo reports (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-to-feature-hole-punch-design-new-48mp-wide-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-hole-punch-48mp-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that plans for next year’s iPhones point to high-end Pro and Pro Max models that ditch the notch entirely in favor of hole-punch front cameras, with 48MP wide cameras on the back. However, Kuo expects that in-screen fingerprint scanning for Touch ID is off until 2023, despite his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754520/iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-2021-iphones-face-id-biometric-security-rumors"&gt;earlier reporting&lt;/a&gt; that it could happen as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iVwJIh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jZWAMA"&gt;A possible foldable iPhone is even further off, slipping from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;previous projection of 2023&lt;/a&gt; to 2024 at the earliest. More immediately, Kuo reiterates expectations of a 5G-equipped iPhone SE next spring and a larger non-Pro version of the iPhone 14 that offers the 6.7-inch frame without the extra Pro features and price bump.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scammers allegedly earned $195,000 referring fake drivers to delivery apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pk0qJXkKa0ji7QXHNzVExDetFak=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883815/uber-stock-0865.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7DlEGm"&gt;The Justice Department has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/fourteen-brazilian-nationals-charged-identity-theft-nationwide-rideshare-and-delivery"&gt;charged over a dozen people&lt;/a&gt; with running a scam on ride hailing and delivery apps. Prosecutors say the alleged scam ring created fake accounts using stolen personal information, then sold those accounts to otherwise unqualified drivers — while also collecting referral bonuses and building software to trick the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P00gRr"&gt;The indictment was revealed on Friday and adds to wire fraud claims &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/nineteen-brazilian-nationals-charged-nationwide-conspiracy-open-fraudulent-driver"&gt;first revealed in May&lt;/a&gt;. It accuses 14 people — all Brazilian nationals and most living in Massachusetts — with identity theft against five unnamed companies. (Prosecutors filed the wire fraud charges against 19 people in total, and 16 have been arrested.) The wire fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the aggravated identity theft charges carry a sentence of at least 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zY0pwj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They allegedly used alcohol orders as an excuse to scan users’ driver’s licenses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkzPvU"&gt;Court documents outline a complicated fraud scheme involving bots, GPS spoofing, social security numbers bought on dark web sites, and driver’s licenses copied from unwitting app users. While the apps in question aren’t named, the complaint’s details &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5dv9/hacking-ring-allegedly-stole-americans-identities-rented-them-to-gig-workers"&gt;match problems&lt;/a&gt; identified on Instacart and Amazon Flex among other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15zlDg"&gt;From around January of 2019 to April of 2021, the group’s members allegedly told customers (falsely) that they needed to scan their driver’s licenses when delivering alcohol. Prosecutors say defendants altered the photos on the licenses, paired them with other personal information, and started accounts that they could sell or rent to drivers. The fake accounts also allegedly helped the group collect referral bonuses that could reach $1,000 apiece — one message shows a delivery company paid $194,800 after getting referrals for 487 fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3edYl"&gt;The conspiracy allegedly broadened when the group bought software that it could rent to drivers, helping them automatically snag orders through bots or spoof locations to make trips appear longer.  As &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/page/file/1392526/download"&gt;an affidavit notes&lt;/a&gt;, the group reportedly advertised its fake accounts to Brazilian nationals working in Massachusetts. It doesn’t detail exactly who bought the accounts, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580094/facebook-bike-messenger-group-undocumented-support-delivery-drivers"&gt;many ride-hailing and delivery workers are undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt; who could have trouble meeting application requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDC6jf"&gt;Software tools have helped people circumvent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;opaque and exploitative&lt;/a&gt; features like &lt;a href="https://entrecourier.com/delivery/delivery-strategies/delivery-tools/will-para-tip-transparency-make-more-money-or-get-you-deactivated/"&gt;DoorDash hiding tips from workers&lt;/a&gt;. But these tools (typically) don’t come with a side of identity theft — and bots and hackers are &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg839d/hacks-bots-and-the-pandemic-have-fueled-a-racist-class-war-on-instacart"&gt;a well-known plague&lt;/a&gt; for workers and customers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US agencies reportedly split over blacklisting Huawei hardware spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCGCsZ76o3lyWOZMBnMu34AhQvc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883797/acastro_190521_1777_huawei_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iLkG06"&gt;Federal agencies like the Pentagon and Commerce Departments can’t decide whether to place Huawei’s former smartphone company, Honor, on the US’s export blacklist, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/huawei-honor-security-export/2021/09/19/6d49d27c-17ef-11ec-b976-f4a43b740aeb_story.html"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7lkEH"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;, top officials at the Commerce, State, and Energy departments, along with the Pentagon, met last week to decide whether to place the smartphone manufacturer on the US’s entity list. Pentagon and Energy staffers supported placing the company on the list while Commerce and State Department officials opposed the idea. If blacklisted, Honor would be unable to receive US tech exports without a license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG8Zne"&gt;Huawei launched Honor in China in 2013 to compete against other popular smartphone companies like Xiaomi. Nearly three years later, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/16/12492310/huawei-smartphone-brand-honor-us"&gt;Huawei announced that the Honor 8&lt;/a&gt; would be available in the US — a test to see whether the company could bring its huge Chinese popularity overseas and become a competitive threat to companies like Apple. Last month, Honor announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621367/honor-magic-3-pro-plus-price-specs-features-cameras"&gt;first flagship phones&lt;/a&gt; since being sold off from Huawei, arriving first in China to be released globally at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrYcjU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The agency divide over Honor shows how the Biden administration is struggling to address the US’s competitive threats against China&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PoHFnf"&gt;The agency divide over Honor shows how the Biden administration is struggling to address the US’s competitive threats against China. In 2019, the Trump administration kicked off this fight by declaring Huawei, one of the world’s largest telecommunications and technology makers, a national security threat. Later, Huawei’s Chief Finance Officer Meng Wanzhou &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201023/us-charges-huawei-fraud-stealing-t-mobile-justice-department"&gt;was indicted for bank and wire fraud&lt;/a&gt; and is currently awaiting an extradition ruling in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cv5PC"&gt;Republican lawmakers have been pushing the Biden administration to use export controls like the Commerce Department’s entity list to curb China’s rise as a competitive threat in the tech industry. Last month, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) &lt;a href="https://gop-foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-china-task-force-members-ask-for-honor-device-co-to-be-added-to-the-entity-list/"&gt;led a letter&lt;/a&gt; with more than a dozen other lawmakers calling on Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to place Honor on the entity list, accusing Huawei’s January sale of the company as equating to “export control evasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCA0mF"&gt;According to Huawei, the sale was prompted in part due to the Trump administration’s 2019 entity listing which &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;made it more difficult&lt;/a&gt; for the company to purchase the software licenses and processors needed to build the Honor devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6bbhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1VRoD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s latest updates lay good groundwork, but don’t add many big new features&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwF119"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 are strange updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="2SHpRr"&gt;Some iOS updates bring huge new features; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872972/apple-ios-13-review-iphone-update-dark-mode-arcade-maps-photos-siri"&gt;iOS 13 had dark mode&lt;/a&gt; (and a lot of bugs) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;iOS 14 had widgets&lt;/a&gt;. Some, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri"&gt;like iOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, brought much needed behind-the-scenes fixes to performance and battery life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="tVZDfx"&gt;But iOS 15 (and its companion, iPadOS 15) does neither. It’s the most incremental and iterative iOS release in years, a grab bag of new features that, while nice to have, don’t really move the needle or change your iPhone experience much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="To4UOa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763173"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AWaE3Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNMjZe"&gt;Looking at the changes and additions in Apple’s latest mobile software, there’s not much to point to in major design changes or UI overhauls; at the same time, Apple doesn’t seem to have made the kind of game-changing performance and battery life improvements that defined quieter updates like iOS 12, or iOS 10’s changes to how it lets third-party apps hook into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zzBk8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most incremental and iterative iOS release in years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yKiKTb"&gt;It doesn’t help, of course, that some of the biggest and most interesting features coming to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t actually here at launch. The flashy SharePlay feature has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;delayed to later this fall&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt; — presumably on deck for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey’s&lt;/a&gt; release — hasn’t even popped up to try in beta yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFhSgZ"&gt;Other big features are still in the works, too: the new detailed 3D view for Apple Maps is limited to just New York, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles at launch, while iCloud Plus’ VPN-like Private Relay will &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-now-considered-a-beta-feature-comes-disabled-by-default-with-ios-15/"&gt;start off as a beta feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Glbkx"&gt;iOS 15 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;already a relatively minor release&lt;/a&gt;, but those delays and omissions leave what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; here at launch feeling even more anemic. It’s not a new vision for Apple’s mobile software as much as a bit of fresh paint and polish for what’s already been here, to the point where it’d probably be fair to call it iOS 14.5 (if Apple hadn’t already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;released that earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPAmcE"&gt;Apple’s updates are occasionally hit or miss (looking at you, iOS 13), so before we dive into features, a word on performance and stability: Functionally, the two new releases work well; I haven’t run into any major issues with performance or battery life on the final version of the software. (I will caveat this note by saying that I’ve been testing the new OSes on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, so performance issues here would be an ominous sign.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxhQxn"&gt;With that out of the way, let’s dive into features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hh2fSp"&gt;Coming soon to a FaceTime near you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ur6vlt"&gt;With SharePlay not shipping with the initial iOS 15 release, this fall’s update is (at least for now) missing out on its biggest and flashiest feature. FaceTime itself is getting some updates unrelated to SharePlay, though, chief of which is the ability to create a link to a FaceTime call that you can send to Windows and Android users (who can join through a web browser). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="43CkgQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FaceTime’s bigger updates are coming later this fall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wEJtSt"&gt;There is also the equally long-overdue grid view, which (combined with the new links) makes FaceTime much more of a viable group video chat solution than it was before. Also added are some new audio features to help your phone better zero in on who’s speaking and a blurred background portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HgTrB"&gt;Even with the new additions here, I don’t think FaceTime is going to replace Zoom or Google Meet as a business solution (nor do I think that’s Apple’s goal here), but iOS 15 does make it much easier to use FaceTime for more casual calls with multiple participants — even if it’s mostly playing catchup here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lC6Po5"&gt;Going on Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="J6ftea"&gt;When it comes to changes that will impact virtually every iPhone owner, Safari’s update is the most significant thing in iOS 15. The browser is getting an Apple-wide redesign across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (the latter coming as part of macOS Monterey later this fall), and it’s the biggest visual change in this year’s update by far. It’s also the most controversial new piece of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, to the point where Apple has added the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;to opt out&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;most of the changes here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmGO2yAGQXC3WV86tKK_t91wI7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863816/Image_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iOS 15’s biggest change comes to Safari, which has a whole new design.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="teQjFI"&gt;On the iPhone, the default view is still Apple’s new “tab bar” mode, which places the URL bar at the bottom of the display and allows you to swipe between open tabs (similar to swiping between apps on a Face ID iPhone). The relocated URL bar is definitely an adjustment, but after a few weeks, I’ve mostly come around to the new design — being able to swipe between tabs is useful, and Apple’s fixed the behavior of the URL bar so that it stays at the bottom of the page. That said, if you prefer the old style, you can easily switch over to it in the Settings app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="l8I58x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new look for Safari&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2ehQm"&gt;The iPad also gets a new, swipeable tab bar, although it’s located at the top of the display (Apple calls it a “Compact Tab Bar”). Unlike on the iPhone, I much prefer Apple’s old design here, which keeps the URL bar on top and a row of tabs underneath it; the scrolling compact bar is harder to use, and has the unfortunate habit of obscuring the rest of your open tabs whenever you click on it. (Incidentally, it seems that Apple agrees the design wasn’t optimal, as the legacy style “Separate Tab Bar” is the default here.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljaq1k"&gt;Design choices aside, the new version of Safari also adds a new tab group feature (which syncs between devices through iCloud) to help sort the chaos of all your open websites across your devices, and the ability to install third-party extensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50eQwD"&gt;You can still install a different browser if you’d like (and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444995/ios-14-default-browsers-chrome-edge-firefox-duckduckgo-safari"&gt;set it as a default&lt;/a&gt;), but since iOS 15 still keeps Apple’s limits on requiring all third-party browsers to use Safari’s rendering engine, you still won’t see any performance differences; just a new UI or different cross-platform syncing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7c3fam"&gt;Focus up&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LAahp2fBneoOSZejeQl1_UNz2ds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863908/Image_5.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Focus modes can filter out your notifications for you.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mRH8oZ"&gt;On the flip side of things is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;Focus modes&lt;/a&gt;, something that I suspect will be ignored by a lot of iOS users. Effectively a souped-up version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb, Focus modes let you establish specific apps and contacts to ping you at specific times. But it’s a lot more useful than that: Focus modes can intelligently trigger at times of day or at geographic locations, and toggle specific home screen layouts. You can also let iOS 15 intelligently switch Focus modes based on when it thinks you’ll want them on or off, but the automated switching is very hit or miss.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bJdiz"&gt;Practically, I’ve been using Focus modes to create a “Personal” mode that shuts off notifications from Slack, my work email, Google Calendar, and anything else that might pull me back online during weekends or evenings, and it works amazingly well. A “Work” focus mode, on the flip side, kicks in whenever I’m at &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; office or during work hours and does the reverse, shutting down Instagram notifications so I can focus (pun intended) on my job. It also swaps in a new home screen with calendar and email widgets, and quick access to things like my 2FA app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTSdiu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus is Apple’s smartest new feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCJj1v"&gt;When you’re in a Focus mode, notifications that come in filter though in a separate bundle (which you can view in the notifications drop down, should you want to double check that nothing’s on fire at work). Apple will also let apps send “time sensitive” notifications that break through Focus limits, for things like your bank urgently letting you know that someone made a withdrawal or if someone rings your video doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol9fg3"&gt;It’s a smarter version of Apple’s previous efforts to make users more conscious of how and when they’re using their phones, recognizing that there might be times when you only want to use some of your phone, without the binary on / off mode that Do Not Disturb is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wm2CtK"&gt;A smarter smartphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cc5vvf"&gt;Apple’s been beating the local machine-learning drum for years, and iOS 15 has two of its most significant moves in that direction yet: Live Text and offline Siri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i16ZXF"&gt;Live Text still works like it does in the beta, which is to say impressively well. You can point your camera at any text, be it handwritten or typed, and Live Text will pull that information into copyable text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RN89KRuNmOYH8ceWxGlB-XjQagw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864016/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_10.01.29_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of all the places that Live Text can work and pull text from.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8aANtv"&gt;Live Text works system-wide too: in the camera app, with photos you’ve saved, in Safari, and even in most text fields, you can tap and hold to pull up a “live text” icon in the same pop-up menu that copy / paste commands live in to snag text directly into a message or email. It’s extremely technically impressive, but in the months I’ve been using iOS 15, I haven’t run into many practical applications for it in my day-to-day life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkkjYT"&gt;Siri also now processes speech entirely on device, allowing (theoretically) more secure and faster interactions, as well as offline Siri commands for the first time. Those are obviously limited in what they can do, but you can kick your phone into airplane mode and still accomplish basic tasks like opening apps, setting timers, and toggling settings. I didn’t notice Siri working dramatically faster in my experience, but the added benefits are nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="pgGxsG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10763113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tskkEm"&gt;iOS 15 also marks the rollout of an upgraded version of Apple’s iCloud service, iCloud Plus. The new subscription service is bundled with existing paid iCloud storage subscriptions, and adds a few new features. There’s a new “Hide My Email” service, which creates burner email addresses that forward to your regular account — similar to a feature offered with Sign In With Apple, but one that you can use for services that don’t work with Apple’s login feature. iCloud Plus expands Apple’s unlimited HomeKit Secure Video storage to more of its plan (the base $0.99 / month plan, in particular, is now included) and lets you have an unlimited number of security cameras pipe into it with the 2TB plan (it was limited to just five before). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zp2QKX"&gt;The biggest feature though, is Private Relay, a VPN-style service that aims to mask your internet traffic from your iPhone. There are a few caveats, though, that separate Apple’s version from a true VPN. First is that you can’t use Private Relay to spoof your location (say, for sports or streaming content), since the service only allows you to anonymize your data within your country and time zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CiNsHv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A6KQxX"&gt;Second is that it only works in Safari, not other apps or browsers. And lastly, the service isn’t available in several countries, including China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines for regulatory reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo1mN3"&gt;Private Relay also isn’t quite ready to go, either: Apple is releasing the feature as a “public beta” to start in iOS 15. It’ll be disabled by default (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;although it’s simple to turn on&lt;/a&gt;) as Apple works to get more feedback and make sure everything works properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MeO5HY"&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XtUEmw"&gt;Apple Maps is rolling out a very fancy looking new 3D map. The new, more detailed maps look great, but they’re &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; limited. At launch, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and London are supposed to be available, but I’ve only seen the new look in the two California cities so far. The additions are nice: trees, bridges, and major buildings now appear in Apple’s stylized 3D view, and streets even show individual lanes when you zoom in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SRD0b2qULBL65TdJu_fLyZzmTZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863909/Image__1__2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Maps looks better than ever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t7n07n"&gt;There are also new AR directions, better transit directions, and improved driving directions (which use the aforementioned improved maps) to help make sure you’re taking the right lane. A lot of this is stuff that Google has offered for a while, but for those who prefer Apple Maps, it’s good to see that Apple is working to stay up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCcO3v"&gt;The built-in Weather app has a new design after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Apple’s purchase of Dark Sky&lt;/a&gt;, adding Dark Sky-style gradient bars for temperature, a Dark Sky-style precipitation notice for the next hour, and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature, precipitation, and temperature. There are also some flashy new animations: a thunderstorm will light up the app with lightning flashes, and rain will bounce off the top of the UI’s boxes and run down the sides of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6x5ScMpN5SxPPFWUP6IFEtTwF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863910/Image_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new overhauled Dark Sky-style Weather app in iOS 15.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2DtSI7"&gt;Despite the Dark Sky purchase, though, Apple is still relying on a combination of first-party data, The Weather Channel, and other third-party sources for its forecasts (even though Dark Sky produced its own weather data API in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDvWel"&gt;Both the Notes and Reminders have a newly added tag system, along with smart folders that can automatically pull in those notes and reminders using those tags. As someone whose Notes app in particular has become an endless pit of hastily jotted down text, it’s a useful addition (although it’ll be even better once macOS rolls out and I can access them on my computer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZdo7T"&gt;Memoji have clothing now. It’s that kind of update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2KtkH"&gt;There’s a new “Shared with You” section that’s been added to several of Apple’s apps, including Photos, Music, Safari, Podcasts, and Apple TV Plus. It’s a useful reminder of Apple’s vice grip over core services on your phone. If people send you links, photos, Apple Music songs, TV Plus shows, Apple News articles, or podcasts, those pieces of media will now be highlighted in Apple’s corresponding apps. The links and photo aspects are the most useful, surfacing old pictures that friends and family members had sent me over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAfFgM1OAMxhTf-_cCy0NmXYMD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863954/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Shared with You pulls links from Messages into a helpful area in Safari.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkG3YO"&gt;But it’s a very Apple kind of feature: only things sent in Messages will appear, and only Apple apps will work. If a friend sends a link to an Apple Music playlist over iMessage, you’ll see it in the Music app. If they send it over WhatsApp, though, or share a Spotify song instead, you’re out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRcLzd"&gt;Some things still haven’t changed from iOS 14, either: App Library still won’t let you move around or edit app categories, so you’re stuck with whatever Apple classifies apps as. Default app support hasn’t meaningfully advanced from the additions of email and web browsers last year, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hjrSNM"&gt;iPadOS 15-specific updates&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3wMe0aBSVratPby4IXwp-x6BsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864030/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cKW05z"&gt;As I noted back in my beta hands-on over the summer, iPadOS 15 is virtually identical to iOS 15, except for a few iPad-specific improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqJZTO"&gt;Two (mostly) welcome changes are the addition of the widget and App Library system added to the iPhone in iOS 14. Where last year’s iPad update added widgets, they could only be viewed in a specific area on the left of the home screen; now, though, iPad users get the same home-screen widgets that iOS has had for a year, along with the App Library feature (so you can hide apps without deleting them entirely). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DF1M6W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Widgets and App Library finally come to the iPad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="txKT7X"&gt;Apple is offering an even bigger widget size option for the iPad, though, which takes up an entire third of the screen in a four-icon by two-icon grid and is physically about the same size as an iPhone 12 when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Given that iOS widgets still aren’t allowed to be fully interactive, it’s not the most useful addition, but you can get truly massive calendar previews and contact lists. So far, the best implementation is the Photos app, which can act as a sizable photo frame on your home screen now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4kkzX"&gt;As a side effect of the expanded widget support, though, Apple bewilderingly reduced the number of icons you can have on an iPad home screen in iPadOS 15. On a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 6x5 grid for icons gets bumped down to a 4x6 grid the second you add a widget, giving the tablets the same layout as an iPhone when incorporating widgets into a home screen layout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rc6Fd"&gt;I’m not entirely sure what Apple’s thinking here is — visual cohesion across devices, perhaps — but the net result is that a 12.9-inch iPad can display approximately the same amount of icons on a home screen as a 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="csMfnT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10763118"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcPA2F"&gt;The other big iPad-specific change here is in how Apple handles multitasking. As I noted over the summer, Apple is largely sticking with its existing system, built primarily on split-screened applications and floating sidebars.  What is new, here, though, is a multitasking menu that’s designed to make it easier to set up (or exit out of) split-screen app views, or to move an app into a hovering sidebar view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vda8Q"&gt;There’s also a new “shelf” view, which appears as a sort of in-app dock that shows all the open windows you currently have open for a specific app, similar to the Control-Down command on a Mac. The app shelf pops up whenever you open an app, or when you tap the multitasking bar, and helps make it easier to wrangle different app windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FF4Af9N1315jqutZsvpK1yH_Hig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863833/Image_3.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The updated Safari on iOS 15, along with a look at the new multitasking bar and shelf view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IzQCb"&gt;Notes on the iPad is getting a new Quick Note feature, which is tailor-made for the Apple Pencil — swipe up from the corner of the screen, and you can jot down a quick note (as the name implies). It pairs really nicely with last year’s handwriting recognition additions, too. On the flip side, it’s another flavor of pop-over window in an OS that already has enough modal things going on without a great way to organize them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN4sap"&gt;After using an iPad with the final version of iPadOS 15 for a few weeks, though, it’s clearer than ever that even with the new changes, it’s still the same old iPad multitasking. My thoughts haven’t changed from when I first tried an early beta this summer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oNcEcq"&gt;iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my home screen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xyf6yH"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZggfpVl5M6_JpZzlNh3_GWGYLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863809/59685084_413aa480_91d3_11e9_9d1f_2c943317f650.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;There’s still a LOT going on with iPadOS 15’s multitasking, though.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N6OLHz"&gt;The most interesting feature coming to iPadOS, however, is Universal Control, which promises a new, seamless way to jump back and forth between a Mac and an iPad using a single mouse and keyboard. It’s the sort of thing that could offer users the best of both worlds of Apple’s computing vision, but we’ll have to wait to see how it actually works later this year; it’s not shipping yet, or even available to try in a beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMxFso"&gt;And, since this is an iPadOS review, I have to note that, once again, Apple has refused to add multi-user support in iOS 15, a feature that it offers on both macOS devices and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/multiple-users-atvb59ec8e2e/tvos"&gt;Apple TVs running tvOS&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also no weather app (despite Apple now owning a company that makes an iPad weather app), no calculator app, and — especially relevant for anyone with ideas of using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;new iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; as a defacto smartphone — no phone app. Maybe next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BK4B14v-hTBEigt0Sjb9MHLTfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864033/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B2a3HU"&gt;Here’s the good news: your phone or tablet will not be worse off for installing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Unless you really, really hate Apple’s new Safari design (which, following a series of beta changes, are less dramatic in the final version than when they were first revealed), it will likely be better. But the ways that iOS and iPadOS are improving are smaller than ever. The new features are more subtle, and the changes — while still helpful improvements generally — won’t really change how you use your phone or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imB4bn"&gt;I noted in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;initial preview earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it felt like a lot of these changes were simply being saved up for a big fall release, even if it would have been possible and made more sense to release them earlier (like many of the FaceTime features, which would have come in handy during the earlier, even more isolated stage of the COVID-19 pandemic). But on the other hand, had Apple done that, it’s hard to see what it could have used as the centerpoint of its Big Annual Software Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pzeSxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After a decade and a half of OS updates, there’s simply fewer things to left to fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfSS5R"&gt;And maybe that’s the point. iOS is now on its 15th major version, a number that doesn’t count significant point releases (which have been tending towards more substantial updates in their own right). Apple has spent a lot of time making it into a great mobile operating system, but after a decade and a half of improvements, updates, and tweaks, there’s less it needs to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B553my"&gt;As the saying goes, if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it, and 15 versions in, there’s not a lot left in iOS that needs to be fixed. There’s almost certainly going to be bigger iOS updates in the future, massive platform changes like iOS 7 or macOS High Sierra that rethink what the iPhone looks like and works like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gAbPNy"&gt;But those inflection points are few and far between, and the future of iOS updates will probably look more like iOS 15: smaller and subtler. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 deals are extra aggressive this year, here’s why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3_zMQMnkK42DgY00r3QevGnIqA=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882128/lcimg_78e65da1_4e90_4b7e_a300_6bce2342e8ea.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px24Oy"&gt;“You get free iPhone upgrades for life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzwceT"&gt;“You get a $500 gift card for switching carriers!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buZXND"&gt;I can almost hear Oprah shouting the many competing offers from all the carriers — AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon — as soon as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was over. They’re all offering huge incentives to entice you to trade-in an old device, switch carriers, then sign up for a top-shelf cellular plan. If you’re in the market for a new carrier and iPhone right now, you can probably land yourself a “free” iPhone 13 (or only pay a nominal fee for the flagship iPhone 13 Pro Max), even if you’re preordering before the phones hit stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwjtSF"&gt;Many of these offers seem too good to be true and are a bit surprising to see on new iPhones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;historically have sold themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Who can ignore Verizon for giving you a $500 prepaid MasterCard gift card, just for ditching your carrier? How about the sky-high trade-in offers that all the carriers are advertising, like the too-good-to-be-true offer of giving you $350 for a used Samsung A50, which retails about $180? Across the board, the carriers are particularly aggressive with their signup offers this year, as detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;in our preorder guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D05T4he8paoSK__to_e-rJJhEN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858831/lcimg_17b9e15c_0998_429c_bb51_493611b203d6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s pricing for the new iPhone 13 models isn’t out of the ordinary — but few people will actually pay that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n0jSDK"&gt;Whether you choose T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&amp;amp;T, all the offers fit the same basic premise. In exchange for a discount on the newest iPhone 13 device, after you trade-in an older device for whatever value, you’ll be paying for the balance of your device in monthly installments. You also must qualify and sign up for a typically more expensive unlimited plan that ties you to your phone and carrier for at least 24-months — or 36-months if you go with AT&amp;amp;T. The new plan will also likely control when and what device you can upgrade to next, which helps carriers and phone manufacturers better forecast the demand for devices and gives you that “free” upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pMgu7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nulRvV"&gt;For those iPhone 13 shoppers who are already happy with their carriers or existing data plans, or just want the latest unlocked device on a pre-paid plan, the carriers won’t extend as generous offers to you. If you’re already an existing customer, at minimum, you have to be willing to upgrade to the premium plans at Verizon, an unlimited plan at AT&amp;amp;T if you’re not already on one, or take a lesser trade-in offer at T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qopFGV"&gt;It is clear that carriers want to take back control over your upgrade cycle by offering scheduled upgrades and want to lock you into a bigger plan than you need by dangling an almost free phone. Sound familiar?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq5k6z"&gt;“The offers are more generous, but the big picture is that we’re seeing a shift from the EIP [Equipment Installment Plan] model to the subsidy model,” according to Wave7 Research’s principal analyst Jeffrey Moore. “To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago, when people routinely got an iPhone for $200, but paid higher monthly rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr8mjv"&gt;It also may seem like Apple is the one that is driving much of these promotions, as more iPhones sold is always beneficial for the company. But as much as Apple needs people to buy new iPhones every year, carriers need the sales even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkgz5V"&gt;According to Wave7 Research’s monthly surveys of retail wireless stores in the US, “more than 60% of smartphone activations at national carrier stores are of iPhones, with remaining activations being of Android devices, with Samsung having dominant Android share.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svV2PO"&gt;Carriers also have an extra incentive to nudge customers toward iPhones this year: the on-going global chip shortage has really affected the supply of Android phones, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676054/t-mobile-cfo-peter-osvaldik-samsung-supply-no-note"&gt;Samsung phones in particular&lt;/a&gt;. In Wave7 Research’s August 2021 survey of retail stores, it found the “supply of the base Galaxy 21 has been particularly weak for Verizon in the U.S., with multiple Samsung models out of stock online.” With a new round of iPhone 13s flooding retail stores, it’s not hard to see why carriers have an incentive to sell iPhones rather than Androids right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="y57ghv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chip shortages have made other phone models difficult to stock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxLTYe"&gt;It doesn’t hurt that service providers also need to shore up their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;5G user base&lt;/a&gt;, as they continue to expand the (fractured) 5G network in America. If iPhones are the lures that can hook customers to upgrade to an all-inclusive, multi-year data plan, then the carriers are in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTO7Sm"&gt;The truth is, Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629003/us-phone-upgrades-apple-samsung-market"&gt;holding onto their phones longer&lt;/a&gt; than they used to (remember the annual upgrade days?), with each generation of phone being more iterative than innovative. While that’s great news for our wallets and the environment, this trend does carriers no favors — they don’t exactly make the most money when we buy unlocked phones and order pre-paid plans or hang on to our phones for three years or more. Now that new iPhones are on the market, this is the time for carriers to once again capture some new customers with shiny iPhone 13s and fancy plans with built-in upgrade cycles — hook, line, and sinker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVINRa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, September 20, 2021, 12:20PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the new upgrade offers from AT&amp;amp;T were only available to customers who are willing to upgrade to the new unlimited plans. The AT&amp;amp;T deals are actually also available to existing customers with unlimited or grandfathered unlimited plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter wants to settle with angry investors for $809 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYdrNYLPJA5_7ZZwd-rBbcvZyBY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883126/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has settled a class action suit for $809.5 million | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SB52Kl"&gt;Twitter said Monday it is proposing an $809.5 million settlement for a 2016 securities class action lawsuit that alleged the company misled investors about its user engagement figures. The complaint alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-announces-proposed-settlement-of-consolidated-class-action-lawsuit-301380355.html"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter said it expects to use cash on hand to pay the settlement amount likely in its fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0WzvZ"&gt;The lawsuit alleged that Twitter provided misleading information to investors about growth metrics to make the company appear financially healthier than it was. The complaint points to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/12/why-twitters-stock-soared-75-on-analyst-day.html"&gt;2014 event Twitter held&lt;/a&gt; with financial analysts where the company provided “unrealistic” growth projections that called for its monthly active users (MAU) “to double to over 550 million users and for revenue to grow by $4.6 billion by 2018.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET6h2t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864148/frankel_twittershareholderclassaction__complaint.pdf"&gt;The complaint alleges&lt;/a&gt; Twitter embarked on a “shell game” where it tried to conceal its user engagement from investors; as user engagement was considered a key driver of MAU growth. “[H]ad Defendants provided investors with complete and accurate information regarding user engagement, investors would have learned that Twitter’s MAU growth— and with it, the Company’s ability to increase revenue — had also stalled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ6VLy"&gt;Twitter stopped reporting its primary user engagement metric— timeline views— in 2014 according to the suit, a practice that made it harder for analysts and investors to track the company’s growth. Timeline views were tallied each time a user visited Twitter and refreshed their timeline to view more tweets, or to conduct a search. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-shares-fall-day-after-report-revives-questions-about-user-base-1438213551"&gt;Twitter said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that the metric had become irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSxYOj"&gt;Instead, it began including what the complaint called “low-quality growth” metrics, including sending automated messages to dormant users to encourage them to log in, so Twitter could include them as an “active” user. This practice was outlined by reporter Nick Bilton in a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/twitter-is-betting-everything-on-jack-dorsey"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article, where he said Twitter had done what many startups did when they needed to “goose” numbers: “they kind of faked it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWBM8"&gt;It also caught the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which asked Twitter in April 2015 —after the company made its annual securities filing— if it planned to provide “alternative metrics” to try to “explain trends in user engagement and advertising services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvmZev"&gt;According to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-43153"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time, Twitter told the SEC it had started to disclose how often users took an action in response to an ad, and how much its advertisers paid for that information. The SEC dropped its inquiry after this reply, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhPUXs"&gt;Under the terms of Monday’s proposed settlement, Twitter denies any wrongdoing or other improper action. The final agreement is subject to court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA4N6W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Extreme heat prompts new rules to protect US workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California’s Summer Of Heat, Power And Fire Woes Arrives Early" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjSvUhXxhlC4-p5-3xvw2yHG5HY=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882980/1233521611.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QHHYu"&gt;Extreme heat is becoming such a big threat to workers in the US that the federal government plans to craft a new federal standard for workplaces, the Biden administration announced today. It’s part of a broader initiative to protect workers and people living in the places most vulnerable to heat-related illness and death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtr6dt"&gt;“Over the past few weeks, I have traveled across the country to see firsthand the devastating human and economic toll of extreme weather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;exacerbated by climate change&lt;/a&gt;,” Joe Biden said in a statement today. “And while we have all seen the graphic and heart-wrenching images of super-storms, wildfires, and floods in recent weeks, another climate disaster is lurking just below the radar: extreme heat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OdPwJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Another climate disaster is lurking just below the radar: extreme heat.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IpYcSi"&gt;The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will start the rulemaking process today to create a new federal heat standard. There aren’t many details yet on what the rule might look like, but the Biden administration’s announcement hints at a few things it could cover: thresholds for heat stress, heat exposure monitoring, and planning for acclimating to heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoOGbg"&gt;OSHA also plans to beef up enforcement of existing labor standards when it comes to heat-related hazards. When the heat index — a measure that includes humidity and temperature — rises above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the agency says it will “prioritize” heat-related issues when it comes to workplace inspections and interventions. It also plans to pay closer attention to industries it deems as having a higher risk of heat stress, including agriculture, construction, delivery workers, and warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmYHOC"&gt;Protecting workers from dangerously hot environments is just one piece of a broader effort &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597823/extreme-heat-democrat-infrastructure-budget-reconciliation"&gt;among Democrats&lt;/a&gt; to tackle an insidious threat that’s only growing worse. Heat kills an average of 702 people every year &lt;a href="https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, making it the deadliest weather-related disaster in the nation over the &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;past three decades&lt;/a&gt;.  Outside of the workplace, children and the elderly, who have a harder time regulating their body temperatures, are especially vulnerable. Black Americans are also 40 to 59 percent more likely to live in the places likely to see the biggest jump in extreme heat related-deaths in the future, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-report-shows-disproportionate-impacts-climate-change-socially-vulnerable"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the Environmental Protection Agency found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtFD7d"&gt;Heatwaves are becoming even more intense as climate change pushes up global average temperatures. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;road-buckling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific Northwest this year would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change, &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found. The country just had its hottest summer on record, &lt;a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/national-climate-202108"&gt;tying a record&lt;/a&gt; set during the infamous 1936 dust bowl. Globally, July was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623843/july-2021-hottest-month-recorded"&gt;hottest mont&lt;/a&gt;h humans have ever recorded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IawErS"&gt;The Biden Administration also announced efforts to turn more schools across the nation into cooling centers, places where nearby residents can find some reprieve during heatwaves. And a program designed to help low-income Americans pay their energy bills will expand to help more people get air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 will give doctors a window into Apple Health app data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saxony Struggles With Covid-19 Infection Rates That Are Germany’s Highest" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luP1bOpS4PD_QA1cqpQYRrS4ko0=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882756/1296121438.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ViFomt"&gt;With the iOS 15 launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;, some iPhone users will have the option to share data from their Health app directly with their doctors through their electronic medical records. Six health record companies are participating in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526024/apple-health-app-data-medical-record-iphone-doctor-access"&gt;initial launch&lt;/a&gt;, and some of those companies say that doctors and medical practices on their systems are eager to start using the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvrvPU"&gt;People who use the option can use the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights/"&gt;new sharing function on the Health app&lt;/a&gt; to let their doctor see data like their heart rate and time spent exercising, as collected through the Health app. It could help physicians keep a closer eye on metrics that might be relevant to a patient’s health without the patient having to take an extra step to manually share the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyBDmD"&gt;Electronic health records company Cerner, which controls around &lt;a href="https://www.ehrinpractice.com/largest-ehr-vendors.html"&gt;a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the records market, is one of the companies in the launch. Right now, any healthcare organizations that use Cerner’s records have to balance time spent implementing new tools against time spent managing COVID-19 surges, Sam Lambson, vice president of interoperability at the company, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But they’re interested in the feature, he says. “Once our client organizations have seen a demo and understand it, the questions are mostly around how quickly they can get it implemented,” Lambson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Hsbg"&gt;A small number of healthcare groups that use electronic health records through Allscripts, which is also part of the launch, have already been using the feature as part of a test phase, says Tina Joros, the company’s general manager and vice president. They’re able to use it with a select few patients. “They’ve got all of the technology in place, and when it’s available for patients, they can start promoting it out to their patient population,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1K61S"&gt;One of those test groups is especially excited about the new ability to see patient data from an at-home blood pressure monitor, Joros says. The physicians at that medical practice typically recommend a particular brand of blood pressure cuff to patients who they want to monitor between visits. That cuff already syncs with the Health app. So if patients chose to share the data, the doctors are able to directly track those blood pressure readings instead of relying on patients to share it more manually. “It really helps the data come full circle,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy9AEG"&gt;Daniel Kivatinos, co-founder and chief operating officer of health records company DrChrono, says he’s heard similar feedback from health providers about the Health app feature. “One of our customers, the provider is excited that they’re going to be able to do remote patient monitoring,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM28VC"&gt;While the data provided by wearable devices and other health apps can be useful, doctors often say they’re worried about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496813/apple-watch-heart-monitor-ekg-false-positive"&gt;information overload&lt;/a&gt;. Joros at Allscripts says the layout of the dashboard within Apple’s health record might help make the flood of information less overwhelming. The default is to give a general overview of the trends in a patient’s Health app. Doctors have the option to see more detail but don’t have to. “We had a good reaction both from our client testers and from our internal physician staff,” she says. “Both liked the way that those dashboards were laid out to help reduce that burden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTNShW"&gt;DrChrono plans to roll the Health app feature to a first set of initial users before expanding gradually to its full customer base, which includes around 4,000 medical practices. The company can track how often the feature is used, and Kivatinos says it plans to collect data on how many patients end up sharing their Health app information into the health record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVhV7h"&gt;Allscripts plans to collect similar data as well. The company will be able to see exactly how many patients use the feature, Joros says. She’s expecting the usage to gradually ramp up in the same way as the other Apple health records program, which launched in 2018 and lets patients pull data from their health records onto their iPhones. “We have seen the usage consistently go up,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Midnight Mass is more slow-burning horror from the creator of Hill House</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SwUUA0lKv3HbIwufVDHKgZhOJZw=/467x0:3134x1778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882657/mm_103_sdr_co3_00180401R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSwqbc"&gt;Throughout the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; anthology, creator Mike Flanagan has carved out a very particular brand of horror. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are slow and methodical, with intricate stories that carefully weave together ghostly scares with family drama. Their small scope keeps them focused. Flanagan’s latest, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;, isn’t part of that anthology, though in many ways it feels like it is. It has the same patient build-up, the intense focus on family dynamics, and even some of the same cast. But &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; also increases the scope — and the scares. Instead of a single family home, its story encompasses a small fishing village, and instead of ghosts it’s more about monsters. It takes a bit to get going, but by the end it descends into pure and gruesome horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKslxy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; takes place on Crockett Island, colloquially known as Crock Pot, an isolated island with a population of just over a hundred residents. There are two important things to know about the island. First, it’s going through a steady decline years after an oil spill decimated the local fishing industry. Second, it’s a very religious place, with St. Patrick’s Church serving as the de facto center of town. At the outset of the show, the big island drama has to do with the aging local priest, who went on a pilgrimage and returned sick, and is now resting in a hospital on the mainland. A mysterious, young Father Paul (Hamish Linklater) arrives to temporarily take his place. Paul reinvigorates the island’s community, turning the church into the bustling, vibrant place it once was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uweCs"&gt;Around the time he arrives, weird things start happening. One day, dozens of dead cats wash up on a beach. Later, a resident swears he saw the old priest going for a walk in the middle of a deadly storm. Stranger still are the miracles: aging residents start to regain their youth, and a young girl stands up from her wheelchair and walks in order to receive communion. All of these seemingly disparate developments are connected to the show’s big twist, which reveals itself about halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SKxZUz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-XIRcjf3l4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HbT4PN"&gt;Like most small town mysteries, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is an ensemble. The story starts out with Riley Flynn (Zach Gilford), a former altar boy who left the island, only to return after a stint in jail for a deadly DUI that continues to haunt him. He’s joined by childhood friend Erin Greene (Kate Siegel), who is similarly back on Crockett after a lifetime away from the island, now pregnant and living in her mother’s old house, while working her old job at the local school. There’s also the town sheriff Hassan (Rahul Kohli), a former NYPD officer and seemingly the only non-Christian on the island; Bev (Samantha Sloyan), the archetypal judgy religious type who helps run the church and guilts people into attending; town doctor Sarah (Annabeth Gish) who is struggling to explain what’s happening to her patients; and Riley’s parents (Henry Thomas and Kristin Lehman) who are just trying to keep it together as they take in their troubled adult son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bk4Fmh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Haunting of Bly Manor is a puzzle box disguised as a ghost story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"},{"title":"Haunting of Hill House is like This Is Us wrapped in a gothic ghost story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc4UPD"&gt;Even though there’s a lot to keep track of, you’ll get to know these characters intimately over the show’s seven episodes, because if there’s one thing the residents of Crockett love more than anything, it’s talking. A huge portion of &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;’ run-time is dedicated to dialogue. You’ll hear long sermons from the new priest, intense and revelatory AA meetings, and too many childhood stories to count. Everyone seems to preface their thoughts with a monologue of some kind. The show is almost like a nesting doll of stories. It can border on overload at times, though it helps that the performances are uniformly great. As much as I wanted to see what happened next, I couldn’t help but get pulled into long, drawn-out speeches about death and the meaning of life. These moments also help set the tone. So much of the show is quiet and thoughtful, which makes the dark moments hit really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BViZwf"&gt;And there are some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dark moments. In its first few episodes, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; feels a lot like the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; shows. There aren’t really jump scares or bloody kills. It’s the kind of horror that you watch through your fingers anticipating something terrible happening … only it rarely does. Eventually the show lets loose in a big, bloody way. It’s gradual — a few deaths here, some horrifying revelations there — but by the end &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; descends into full-blown horror. Like, we’re-on-the-run-because-we’re-all-gonna-die kind of horror. Gruesome-killfest-that-will-keep-you-up-at-night kind of horror. And it’s all the more horrifying because of how the show slowly ramps up, and how connected you feel to the main characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk2knT"&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable thing about &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is how it manages to balance those more contemplative elements of the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; series — serious reflections on grief and guilt, faith and family — with more traditional horror elements. It doesn’t lose what made Flanagan’s past work so successful. Instead it twists it into something larger, more unsettling, and a whole lot scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwoW8F"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Midnight Mass &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;starts streaming on Netflix on September 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s high-fashion collaboration with Balenciaga in Fortnite includes a hoodie for a walking dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCO1qp6RpakOtM7Sc3qGQ_aPfL8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882491/18BR_Textile_UGC_Social_Store_front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Doggo in a hoodie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYX8go"&gt;Epic Games is partnering with fashion house Balenciaga to bring the first-ever high-fashion &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins into the game. But the two companies aren’t just working on virtual clothes. They’re also partnering on an in-game Balenciaga-themed hub and a real-world clothing line that you’ll be able to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEgp5H"&gt;There will be four new skins, which you can see in the below photo, and each will have alternate styles. Epic is also planning to sell other Balenciaga-themed accessories, including &lt;a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/men/shoes/speed"&gt;a pickaxe based on the Speed Sneaker&lt;/a&gt; and Balenciaga backpack back blings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jtVxy7fjhqRGYAhhdsScQ1zA50k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858219/feed_FB_1920x1080.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The new Balenciaga-themed skins coming to &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TD1hPo"&gt;The new gear will be available both in in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; usual in-game storefront and in the Balenciaga-themed “Strange Times” Creative hub, which includes a virtual Balenciaga store where you can buy the cosmetics. Below is a preview of what that area looks like — there’s even an in-game animated billboard above the virtual store featuring the walking dog Doggo in the hoodie. That billboard will show up in the real world, too, in Tokyo, London, Seoul, and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7t15ZPyxr-2q0KUn1gDXcUjRvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858262/body_img_FB_8__1_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strange Times hub with a virtual Balenciaga store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ph5oY"&gt;And if you love the hoodie Doggo is wearing, you’ll be able to buy it and a number of other items, including crew neck shirts, T-shirts, and hats, as part of the real-world &lt;em&gt;Fortnite-&lt;/em&gt;themed Balenciaga collection. Those clothes will go on sale on Monday or Tuesday, depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1MVXUs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10762775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQShfR"&gt;Epic isn’t the first video game to collaborate with a fashion house. Gucci partnered with Roblox on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440134/gucci-garden-roblox-experience-metaverse-date"&gt;surreal virtual garden&lt;/a&gt; in May, for example, while Louis Vuitton made skins for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;characters in Riot Games’ &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Balenciaga itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;made a video game&lt;/a&gt; to debut its Fall 2021 collection that was made in Unreal Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYWvkl"&gt;But the pairing of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and high fashion is an obvious one given how important virtual outfits are to the culture of the game. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is fashion,” Adam Sussman, president of Epic Games, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The entire experience of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is centered around self expression, player agency, and the ability to live out a fantasy of portraying characters and outfits that people want to wear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YYy5lo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Fortnite is fashion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ3XBu"&gt;He has a point; when I play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, I’m constantly shuffling through different outfits and accessories to fit my mood or to create fun mashups. (Such as, say, having Master Chief wield Kratos’ Leviathan Axe while &lt;em&gt;The Madalorian’s&lt;/em&gt; Grogu floats behind him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P756pC"&gt;The partnership between Epic and Balenciaga also could be a preview of how Unreal Engine is used to create virtual and real-world experiences in the future. That animated Doggo billboard that will appear in-game and in actual cities, for example, was made in Unreal Engine and reused assets created as part of Epic and Balenciaga’s collaboration. It seems likely that we’ll see Epic doing similar transmedia pushes for other &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; partnerships down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cO4YWE"&gt;Epic didn’t commit to if or when we might see other fashion collaborations, but it sounds like it’s definitely a possibility. “I think this is just the start,” said Emily Levy, who works on partnerships at Epic. “I think what’s really special about what we can do with our technology and with our community is create new ways for players to self-express [and] also new ways for players to experience fashion. I think you’re going to continue to see us explore what those two opportunities can look like for our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCOH43"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA1Uf7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEHKoO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq5gY6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
