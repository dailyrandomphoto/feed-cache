    <title>Go read this report about the horrifying leaks coming from school ransomware attacks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jqq9tB"&gt;Ransomware has been a hot-button topic in 2021 due to its impact on critical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632378/pandemic-ransomware-health-risks"&gt;hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616882/gigabyte-technologies-ransomware-attack-data-leak-112-gb-ransomexx"&gt;computer manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-are-leaking-childrens-data-s-little-parents-can-rcna1926"&gt;a recent report from &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;may be one of the more heartbreaking accounts of the effects hackers can have: it details how data leaks from attacks on schools can put student’s most sensitive information out onto the internet, available to anyone who knows how to find it and is willing to pay. It’s a story that’s well worth a read for all the details it goes into and edge cases it explores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEGjoh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;’s report, one school district had an Excel sheet called “Basic student information” posted to the dark web after it refused to pay a ransom, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevincollier/status/1436306731961921536?s=20"&gt;according to the FBI’s instructions&lt;/a&gt;. The article’s author, Kevin Collier, breaks down the shocking information it contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AbZAWW"&gt;It lists students by name and includes entries for their date of birth, race, Social Security number and gender, as well as whether they’re an immigrant, homeless, marked as economically disadvantaged and if they’ve been flagged as potentially dyslexic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eZSNjS"&gt;The school knew about the attack and informed parents about it — making it potentially one of the better scenarios. Insurance covered identity theft protection for staff, but it’s unclear whether that benefit extends to students even after getting lawyers involved. In other cases, when &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; asked some schools about their leaks, they seemed “unaware of the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FOC8zm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Credit and identity theft is one of the obvious problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="feImav"&gt;It’s hard even to comprehend how it could affect a student’s social life if their grades, medical info, or free or reduced-price lunch benefit status leaked online. What’s easier to understand is the impact of having their SSNs, birthdays, and names sold to unscrupulous people: &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a student whose info was used in attempts to get a credit card and car loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qxht0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421193/credit-reporting-infrastructure-errors-experian-equifax-transunion"&gt;I know firsthand&lt;/a&gt; the hell that can come from having your credit wrecked before you even get out of high school, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. The report cites Eva Velasquez from the Identity Theft Resource Center, who tells parents to freeze their kid’s credit to keep them safe from identity theft. Parents already have enough concerns — dealing with kids who are learning remotely or figuring out how to get kids physically to school, all the while worrying that they could catch COVID while they’re there. It’s hard to accept that parents should also become the data security and privacy experts that school systems are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RsVTnI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Protecting kids’ data could be easier said than done&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8XZVg"&gt;As an expert at a non-profit for protecting school’s IT systems told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;, “it is a solemn responsibility that schools have to care for kids, so they collect a lot of data with that.” Clearly, many schools (the report mentions that 1,200 schools’ info had been published by ransomware attackers this year) aren’t up to the task of keeping that data safe — though doing so is easier said than done, especially while working with budgets that don’t allow for the level of corporate security attackers are bypassing daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjyfJz"&gt;It’s incredibly sad to imagine students having to simultaneously worry about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170292/gizmodo-schools-fbi-grade-phone-hacking-surveillance-tech"&gt;their school using FBI-grade tech to steal personal data&lt;/a&gt; and hackers stealing information for their school and selling it to criminals. While it may be hard to think about, it's even more difficult to push for change if we don’t know what’s happening, which makes &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-are-leaking-childrens-data-s-little-parents-can-rcna1926"&gt;reports like &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; so essential and worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google faces whistleblower complaint that it underpaid temp workers by as much as $100 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KgUhiS5QIjFHBCOC_qCgVEgCco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842346/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dyk8p4"&gt;In 2019 a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report called&lt;/a&gt; Google’s then-121,000-strong assortment of temporary employees “a shadow work force that now outnumbers the company’s full-time employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blkoj1"&gt;Now, a whistleblower has filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that gaps in pay between temporary workers and full-time employees doing similar work had widened over the last few years, stretching far enough that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/10/google-underpaid-workers-illegal-pay-disparity-documents"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it broke local laws in the UK, Europe, and Asia. Even worse, documents viewed by the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/technology/google-temporary-workers-labor-laws-pay.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveal that last December, Google managers discovered the problem and instead of addressing it immediately, they held off on taking action and only applied correct rates for the year’s new hires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t6loox"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hybrid work is coming to big tech. Its contractors might not be so lucky ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22545717/big-tech-hybrid-work-remote-contractors-google-apple-amazon-facebook-microsoft"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="83K5il"&gt;The whistleblower is being represented by lawyers from &lt;a href="https://whistlebloweraid.org/"&gt;Whistleblower Aid&lt;/a&gt; and has approached the issue by claiming that Google misled investors in the US by not reporting the legal and financial liabilities it could face abroad. Google did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however in a statement reported by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, Google chief compliance officer Spyro Karetsos said “It’s clear that this process has not been handled consistent with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company...We’re going to figure out what went wrong here, why it happened, and we’re going to make it right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLwGPA"&gt;While the US doesn’t require companies to pay temporary workers the same rates as full-time employees, the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; reports that more than 30 countries do have pay parity laws. The problem apparently arose because Google mapped out the rates of comparable full-time roles in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) in 2012 and 2013, and the Asia/Pacific region in 2017 — but didn’t update those rates afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwXZGr"&gt;That meant staffing agencies filling the temporary roles were using outdated data that didn’t match rising wages for full-time employees until compliance managers noticed the issue. The complaint says Google kept paying the outdated rates while managers went back and forth over what to do, and it claims the amount of back pay owed in more than 16 countries over the last nine years adds up to more than $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYec42"&gt;There’s no word available on whether the SEC is investigating, but if Google faces an inquiry or is fined, then this problem could become even more expensive. Even at those numbers, it shouldn’t slow down Google or its parent company Alphabet, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596592/google-q2-2021-record-revenue-profit-youtube-ad-cloud-search"&gt;notched $18.5 billion in profit during Q2 of this year alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge says Apple may be ‘stretching the truth’ on Mac malware concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WT78OBjVXFiPS-ksPeOd2a7T5Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842145/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rxJEyX"&gt;During the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Epic&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple software leader Craig Federighi argued that tight control over the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"&gt;was necessary for securing the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers didn’t buy it, writing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;in her ruling&lt;/a&gt; Friday that he may have been “stretching the truth for the sake of the argument.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BLF0Y"&gt;Federighi cast heavy doubts about whether Apple would be able to secure iPhones without its App Review system acting as a gateway, by saying that the macOS security &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;was basically in a bad place&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Rodgers doesn’t think Federighi has the proof to back it up (you can read her quotes below in context on page 114): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlACaa"&gt;While Mr. Federighi’s Mac malware opinions may appear plausible, they appear to have emerged for the first time at trial which suggests he is stretching the truth for the sake of the argument. During deposition, he testified that he did not have any data on the relative rates of malware on notarized Mac apps compared to iOS apps. At trial, he acknowledged that Apple only has malware data collection tools for Mac, not for iOS, which raises the question of how he knows the relative rates. Prior to this lawsuit, Apple has consistently represented Mac as secure and safe from malware. Thus, the Court affords Mr. Federighi’s testimony on this topic little weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uLbYm3"&gt;Woof. Basically, Judge Rodgers says that Federighi was trying to make the Mac look bad so iOS could shine, without much evidence. After discussing notarization and App Review a bit more, she concludes that Apple could implement a system similar to the Mac’s without giving up much of the security iOS already enjoys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GXEznr"&gt;Ultimately, the Court finds persuasive that app review can be relatively independent of app distribution. As Mr. Federighi confirmed at trial, once an app has been reviewed, Apple can send it back to the developer to be distributed directly or in another store. Thus, even though unrestricted app distribution likely decreases security, alternative models are readily achievable to attain the same ends even if not currently employed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TtDFd2"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that Judge Rogers didn’t end up forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores or side-loading, and that this opinion is only contending one of Apple’s points. But it’s sharp criticism of Apple’s more prominent defenses of its locked-down approach to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFbYaW"&gt;Epic argued at trial that Apple could achieve security and privacy on iOS without controlling the exclusive way to distribute apps. It suggested that Apple could use a system similar to the Mac — by scanning apps before they run, and checking to see if it’s the same code that Apple has notarized. While the Mac notarization process doesn’t currently include all of the checks that happen in App Review, in theory it could if Apple wanted it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIscoZ"&gt;Federighi strongly disagreed that this would be sufficient. He argued that iPhones have more sensitive data than Macs do, that the iPhone’s popularity makes it a bigger target than Macs, and that Mac users have basically just learned to be more careful when installing apps. He also argued separately that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;isn’t happy with where security is on macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and said that adopting the same security model would be a “very bad situation for [Apple’s] customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2ReD5r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Craig Federighi explains why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"},{"title":"Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchases, rules judge in Epic v. Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YNN05K"&gt;Judge Rodgers argues against Apple’s stance that third-party app installations or app stores would seriously harm iOS’s security. The Mac’s Notarization system currently doesn’t keep away the kinds of problems that App Review does (or, at least, is supposed to), but there’s no reason why it couldn’t. Even if Apple doesn’t want to implement it onto iOS, perhaps it could consider taking her suggestions to heart if its unhappy with the state of macOS security.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing new ‘Favorites’ to bring order to your chaotic feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKNcTBubP5QtM-Fi0UGPO_qALP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842022/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yFl5h3"&gt;You’re on Instagram looking for your best friend’s daily dog update, but you have to scroll endlessly through a sea of posts you care little about, and probably forget what you’re looking for in the first place. After a few extra annoyed scrolls, you close the app in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJ2Yd"&gt;It seems Instagram is well aware of your plight, because it is quietly testing out a solution for your messy feed called “Favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph25cH"&gt;According to Alessandro Paluzzi, a mobile developer who first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;posted about the new feature on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Favorites lets you categorize your most important Instagram accounts (friends and creators) as your priorities, so that their posts will land “higher” in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhrAp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on "Favorites"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ Posts from your favorites are shown higher in feed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NfBd8v4IHR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NfBd8v4IHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZMmGi"&gt;If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because Instagram was testing a different &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15856858/instagram-favorites-private-sharing-friends-list"&gt;Favorites feature back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which you let you limit the exact audience for each post. For example, you could share your wedding photo with just your designated favorites, rather than with your entire following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="74JCiE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new feature gives you more control over who you see first in your feed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc6osZ"&gt;The 2021 iteration of Favorites, however, is about giving you more control over your feed — by telling Instagram which accounts are most important to you. After all, you may follow a bunch of different brands and creators on your account, but you don’t necessarily prioritize their content on the same level as your closest friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkjEUC"&gt;Currently, Instagram ranks the order of your feed by the most recent and shared posts from the people you follow, plus other “signals” like how likely you’ll engage with a post, according to the company’s June 2021 &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about its algorithm. While you may “like” many posts you see, those may not be the content you’re actually looking for, but might be sending Instagram all the wrong signals on what you actually want to see in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treq2k"&gt;It’s not clear whether this Favorites feature will become an official feature at all or if it will change before it’s rolled out more broadly. In the meantime, you just might see this feature in your account menu, just below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;“Close Friends”&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that lets you control who you share your Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeQr8E"&gt;We’ve reached out to Instagram for more information on this new feature and will update this article should the company respond.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hqcf4w"&gt;Author Stephen King and Humble Bundle &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fhumble-charity-red-screen-stephen-king-books&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22667291%2Fstephen-king-short-story-red-screen-humble-bundle-aclu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are teaming up to release an exclusive short story&lt;/a&gt; called “Red Screen.” All pay-what-you-want proceeds (starting at a $5 minimum) from “Red Screen” will benefit the American Civil Liberties Union while the story is available, from September 10th through September 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLopcX"&gt;Besides being notable as one of the newest entries in King’s prolific body of work, “Red Screen” is also the first Humble Bundle Exclusive. Based on what little has been shared of the plot, it certainly sounds...interesting. The description follows (emphasis mine): “The never before published story follows a cop who interrogates a &lt;strong&gt;deranged plumber&lt;/strong&gt; who just murdered his wife, only to discover something far more insidious.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1G3F5z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s likely not about the video game plumber&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6NLMGp"&gt;I’m guessing King is not referencing Mario (of the brothers Mario) here — though his work &lt;a href="https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Phantamanta"&gt;has been rumored to have inspired the games&lt;/a&gt; — so this could involve actual plumbing adjacent murder. Somehow both more and less frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yh6YZp"&gt;As far as digital platforms are concerned, King has a bit of a history of tinkering with different release strategies. The novella &lt;em&gt;Ur&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/10/stephen-king-kindle-ur"&gt;was exclusive to Amazon’s second-generation Kindle&lt;/a&gt; at launch. King’s relationship with Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/25/5937247/nearly-900-authors-sign-letter-against-amazon-in-hachette-dispute"&gt;would eventually sour&lt;/a&gt; due to the company’s aggressive tactics with publisher Hachette. King has also chosen to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/2/3058147/stephen-king-eschewing-ebooks-joyland"&gt;skip ebook releases entirely&lt;/a&gt; in the past. At least with this Humble Bundle experiment, throwing some literary spaghetti at the wall is benefiting a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue Pocket preorders won’t arrive until December 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Analogue Pocket" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X-5SaI9RIppnGRKFMnjzW33Bjk4=/165x0:1853x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841996/4_Analogue_Pocket_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j47Cz8"&gt;The Analogue Pocket has experienced a few delays already due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it’s suffering another, &lt;a href="https://support.analogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/4408932900365"&gt;the company shared on its site&lt;/a&gt;. Preorders for the retro handheld that can play Game Boy cartridges and other formats like Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, and more via adapters will ship “at the latest in December.” The $199 console was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22361017/analogue-pocket-handheld-delayed-electronic-component-shortage"&gt;previously slated to launch in October&lt;/a&gt;, following a delay that pushed it from its original 2020 launch window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cdjbEf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Analogue Pocket is a gorgeous, modern handheld for playing your old Game Boy games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5D5ljy"&gt;Analogue says that “due to new Covid restrictions with our assembly partners, their capacity to deliver within our agreed timeframe has been affected.” Though understandably frustrating for people who like to stay entertained during tough times, you can’t pin blame just on Analogue since chip shortages spurred by the pandemic have impacted nearly every company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEFtih"&gt;Analogue shared that, after the holiday season, it expects to have the Pocket and all of its accessories restocked and ready for immediate shipping. So, hopefully this is the final delay for the handheld.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6g9tj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 10th, 5:01PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony appears to have sold out of PS5 consoles for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqsXOf"&gt;The PlayStation 5 is still difficult to get, but as restocks come and go one of the most reliable sources is Sony itself. Sony’s direct online store has opened a queue for ordering the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=e1i2kfmr0b"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; console and &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=e1i2kfmr0b"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8vJrz"&gt;Once you’re on the landing page, you do not have to refresh the page, just try to wait patiently. When the countdown finishes, make sure you have your PlayStation Network account info ready to log in and complete the purchase if you are allocated a spot to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This tiny plastic Shockbox makes Magic: The Gathering games even more painful  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ya0jVrtsyo0nh9sqtCbNeExWVQ=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841776/sheepwave__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sheepwave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L1FLxX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; is a painful game. It hurts to see your meticulously crafted deck obliterated by a killer combo by turn four or to have your game-winning creature fizzle into nothing with a well-timed &lt;a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=526238"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.sheepwave.com/"&gt;Sheepwave&lt;/a&gt; — a streamer, artist, and &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; content creator — doesn’t think this already ruthless game is painful enough. To add a little spice to her &lt;em&gt;Magic&lt;/em&gt; games, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sheepycutie"&gt;Sheepwave&lt;/a&gt; made the Shockbox — a box that delivers a tiny electrical jolt whenever a player takes damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuq9aJ"&gt;Sheepwave says the Shockbox was born out of a “twisted” sense of humor and an affinity for electrical engineering projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEMCz5"&gt;“The whole thing started as a one-off joke I made,” Sheepwave tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “But people really responded to it, and it was well within my skill set. Electrical engineering challenges are a particular kind of fun, and the fact that I was able to put those skills into making such a unique spectacle was really fun to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t83Aql"&gt;The Shockbox is a plastic junction box filled with wires, balsa wood, and a small device similar to a TENS unit which delivers the electrical shock through electrodes taped to a player’s arm. Designed to be used by up to four players at a time (perfect for a Commander or Two-headed Dragon game), the Shockbox zaps a person after they take a random amount of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w13dNmZ5c0pTfV-yMQS7AWe8tyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840818/shockbox2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Sheepwave&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Shockbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WqA0vz"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Magic&lt;/em&gt;, players start with 20 points of health or more depending on the format of the match. You win the game by reducing your opponent’s life total to zero, accomplished by hitting your enemy in the face with a combination of monsters and spells. The Shockbox keeps track of a player’s life total and each time a player takes damage they press a button on the box one time for each point of damage taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3oUCn"&gt;Getting a tiny jolt for every single point of damage would get old quickly, so Sheepwave created a delightfully insidious method to keep games interesting and players on their toes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs6N1Q"&gt;“It tracks four separate thresholds of damage,” Sheepwave explains. “Once a player has taken more damage than their threshold — which is a random value somewhere between 1 and 10 that the box modifies to build suspense at low life totals — it activates a shock, the duration of which is determined by how many points of damage they put in before it went off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRa7Te"&gt;To put it simply, you never know when or for how long you’re gonna get shocked. And, to ratchet up the fun-xiety, Sheepwave programmed each button to flash to warn the player as they mark their damage that a shock will come Soon™. Here’s the box in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QOWWDd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipQ1B0VnDlE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BAglct"&gt;It’s hilarious hearing the players squeal whenever they get shocked but Sheepwave stresses how important safety was when designing this box. The actual shocking mechanism of the box is powered separately from the rest of the box’s components and runs off a single nine-volt battery which isn’t powerful enough to cause harm. She also installed circuit breakers and fuses players can pull out of the box to disconnect it from the power source should an emergency arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQGb6X"&gt;“Making sure the systems are separate means even a worst case failure on one side won’t put anyone in danger and the Shockbox running on internal batteries rather than a wall plug is another safety feature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFd9vH"&gt;Sheepwave also created a calibration mode for the box that allows each player to set their shocks at a level comfortable for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmqIhw"&gt;“While its been very fun to play up the ‘mad scientist with no regard for safety or sanity’ thing on social media, I definitely want to be sure people understand that image is for entertainment value and I’ve put several times more work into safety features than anything else.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hjWPr"&gt;According to Sheepwave, the shocks don’t really hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdGCQT"&gt;“The experience of the shocks are startling, not painful,” she says. “They are a bit unpleasant but in a thrilling sort of way. At one point, the involuntary contraction made me drop a hand of cards on the table, which I found very funny.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o46vxu"&gt;Sheepwave conceived of the box for several months but says it only took her about a month to actually build it. Keeping the box compact was one of the biggest challenges of the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3Xi0I"&gt;“It went through a lot of revisions,” Sheepwave said. “The first version was built in a Tupperware container.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__h8jmPdu11tUhtJeaVvzQia-l0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840829/shockbox1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sheepwave&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D modeling of the Shockbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L6k1CR"&gt;The Shockbox does come with &lt;a href="https://www.sheepwave.com/shockbox"&gt;limitations and rules&lt;/a&gt; that Sheepwave created to keep play interesting. Players are not allowed to gain more than 60 points of health and certain cards are banned — especially ones that arbitrarily end or extend the game irrespective of life totals like &lt;a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425817"&gt;Platinum Angel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ipzpM"&gt;Sheepwave says there are certain decks that she discourages people from playing with the Shockbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aw1dXc"&gt;“Playing overly defensive decks just doesn’t promote the kind of experience people sitting down with electrodes strapped to them hope to have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqJKDz"&gt;Eat shit blue control decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQzfyj"&gt;Sheepwave doesn’t intend to sell the Shockbox, so don’t expect to show up at your next Friday Night &lt;em&gt;Magic&lt;/em&gt; intending to terrify and delight your friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY1Rxu"&gt;For now it’s simply a “shocking” little addition to her &lt;em&gt;Magic&lt;/em&gt; streams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1U8Kqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paNxBU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Epic v. Apple ruling could put a serious dent in Apple’s $19 billion App Store business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMr5Eooyy35VxZv0SIpZaTgBAF8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841772/VRG_TBP_Epic_VS_Apple_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdSysz"&gt;The App Store may never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luTZbh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;Today’s ruling&lt;/a&gt; from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial mandates that Apple must allow all developers the option to point directly to other payment systems, in addition to Apple’s own in-app purchasing system (IAP). It’s a decision that cuts right to the heart of the roughly $19 billion a year the App Store brings in for Apple, because at the end of the day, the App Store makes most of its money off in-app purchases inside free-to-download games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLxulz"&gt;It’s not a total sledgehammer to the heart of Apple’s walled garden; the ruling still maintains the App Store as the only place that users can go to to buy or download new apps, and doesn’t challenge Apple’s 30 percent cut of those purchases. And the ruling only technically impacts US-based companies for now, which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-stands-to-lose-a-few-billion-dollars-annually-from-ruling?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes only makes up about $6.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; (or about a third) of Apple’s global App Store revenue, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqPIpz"&gt;But for companies that make free apps with in-app purchases, subscription apps, and virtually any kind of app or service that doesn’t require an upfront payment to purchase the app itself, it’s a whole new ball game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d5aHrr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store is a &lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; top-heavy enterprise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qiTqVX"&gt;An often-overlooked fact about the App Store is that it is a &lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; top-heavy enterprise. It would only take a few developers to make a huge impact on Apple’s roughly $19 billion per year business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1eFkh"&gt;Reports from SensorTower &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;cited by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 claimed that more than 95 percent of the App Store’s total revenue comes from the top 2 percent of developers, with the remaining 98 percent of developers making less than $1 million per year (which, in turn, qualifies them for reduced fees through Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohFvEZ"&gt;And, as the injunction reveals, the vast majority of App Store billings come from gaming. Games account for approximately 70 percent of the entire App Store’s revenue, and 98 percent of in-app purchase revenue. The App Store is a game store, and more specifically, it’s a game store for massive, free-to-play games that make nearly all of their money from in-app items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1sKIkG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The App Store &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game store; 98 percent of all IAP is games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ax44sL"&gt;A quick glance at lists of the top-grossing apps on the App Store seems to confirm those numbers: almost every single game on the list is a free app that relies exclusively on in-app purchases to make money (with the exception of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, which is a paid app &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; in-app purchases). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aA49ork8ArCP2ttn3S3oLw_Ev9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840276/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excerpt from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ ruling detailing App Store revenue breakdown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wbQ1Aq"&gt;It won’t take many customers changing their mind to make big waves in how much money Apple makes, either. As the ruling explains, the 70 percent of App Store revenue from games comes from just 10 percent of all App Store users; over 80 percent of customer accounts generate “virtually no revenue” at all for either Apple or developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1kKOu"&gt;That assumes, of course, that developers are willing to adopt the soon-to-be added option for alternative payment methods when the court mandated date of December 9th arrives. And that’s pending any appeals putting this ruling on hold — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"&gt;Epic has already announced its intent to appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUIo94"&gt;There are plenty of details that will need to be worked out. Will developers be able to offer a PayPal or Stripe button, or will they have to link out to external sites? Will Apple be able to require that developers charge the same price for third-party payments, or will devs offer discounted prices to account for not having to pay Apple’s cut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywZrny"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We will immediately start working on a build of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/heyhey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@heyhey&lt;/a&gt; where users can sign-up and pay from the app. Proud to have played a small part in the events that lead to this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/s0ZxTaerpN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s0ZxTaerpN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1436356844570689546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVt2AY"&gt;Some developers immediately announced plans to offer a payment alternative. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1436356844570689546"&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;, which had its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;controversial fight with Apple last year&lt;/a&gt; over in-app payments, said less than an hour after the news broke that it would implement a version of its app that allows users to directly pay as soon as possible. Hey presumably won’t be the only major app to make the switch, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq6RRm"&gt;But there will likely be plenty of developers who won’t offer an alternative payment — Apple’s own payment systems do offer some benefits, as Halide developer Sebastiaan de With tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re honestly quite pleased with the smoothness of Apple’s offering for payments — from handling taxes all over the world to refunds, Apple Pay, and more — so we’re unlikely to change the way we do business at present.” Smaller developers may simply not have the resources (or the desire) to implement their own payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7t6COt"&gt;The new change may mean that more money could flow through iOS apps than ever before. In theory, there’s nothing stopping Netflix from putting a full signup queue in its app now, instead of the simple sign-in button it currently offers for new accounts — or letting Spotify offer its Premium subscriptions directly to customers without Apple taking a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ax7o1m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8SDeDl"&gt;The ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;builds on a smaller App Store change&lt;/a&gt; made last week. Apple had previously conceded to let “reader” apps like Spotify and Netflix link out to a payment page in a settlement with the Japan Fair Trade Commission, but that applied to apps that didn’t make Apple money anyway. Today’s court injunction, on the other hand, applies to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; apps — including the ones that contributed the most to the App Store’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxOsUi"&gt;Under the new rules, Apple won’t see its full cut of many big apps’ payments anymore. If developers — and customers — take up the chance to pay for their in-game items and dating app swipes in a different way, Apple may not have just lost a big chunk of control over the App Store; it might be losing a big chunk of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;its services business&lt;/a&gt; for good. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F7PUnd0Ooh7SIgjg0DXHPjcNaEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69841512/acastro_210831_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The pace of change is quickening even as Apple tries to stop it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gH3bi2"&gt;Apple’s app store policies have caused controversy and consternation many times over the years, but few periods have been as active and strange as the last two weeks. For the first time, we are seeing Apple being forced to react directly to lawsuits and regulators with substantial policy changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ksp8v4"&gt;The biggest example has of course just happened today: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ruling from judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case&lt;/a&gt;. Apple must now allow apps to link out to other purchasing options in addition to in-app purchases. But that follows two court case settlements and a new law in South Korea that also have implications for how Apple treats developers. The pace of change is increasing and instead of leading, Apple is reacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kc04Fq"&gt;Apple will surely appeal the Epic ruling, but even if it ultimately loses, there’s a good chance that it won’t be enough to appease the legislators and lawyers who are circling Apple’s store as the main way to rein in Apple’s power. And there’s an even better chance that the developers who must try to navigate all those rules will also continue to feel like Apple is spending more effort protecting its profits than empowering developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAdqWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting in 2019, there is an increased cadence of changes in reaction to controversies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8RoO"&gt;Here, then, is a very brief history of the major policy changes and statements Apple has made about the App Store over the years. The impetus for these different changes (or, as Apple tends to call them, “clarifications”) has varied, but the trend has remained the same. Apple has worked hard to keep the fundamental, central model of a 30 percent cut intact while softening it around the edges to appease various constituencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAGEfu"&gt;But just take a look at the timing and cadence of these changes. After a development period from 2007 to 2011 when Apple fills out the features, there’s a large gap when Apple made few notable policy changes. Then, a major shift in 2016 to address some growing discontent among developers. And then, starting in the summer of 2019, there is an ever-increasing cadence of controversies and policy tweaks to address them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WptOz"&gt;As time goes on, policy changes are coming faster and the hairs Apple is splitting are getting thinner. My instinct is to say that enough is enough: Apple should just make a couple of sweeping changes and get it all done at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEiPV0"&gt;Clearly, Apple doesn’t agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGeu0u"&gt;Instead, the company is in a defensive crouch, stepping back only when forced and as little as possible. That might be a good strategy to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1433300497813815304"&gt;make sure every regulator feels like it got its pound of flesh&lt;/a&gt; and thus minimize the change Apple will have to make, as Steven Sinofsky speculated, but it’s a terrible strategy for making developers — and customers — feel good about the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bPidhv"&gt;
&lt;p id="F0QDxT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 11th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;At WWDC, Steve Jobs says that Apple won’t have the ability for developers to install “native” apps, but instead will need to use web apps. It was the infamous “&lt;a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/06/13/a-very-sweet-solution/"&gt;sweet solution&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RG0Ljf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 17th, 2007 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind as it becomes clear that the demand is there (and as the home brew app movement gains momentum). It announces it will release an &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/apple-confirms-iphone-sdk-coming-next-year/"&gt;SDK for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUjRqw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 10th, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html"&gt;Apple App Store for the iPhone launches&lt;/a&gt; with 500 apps and a 30 percent cut of all sales going to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjAwSw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7th, 2008 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with Nick Wingfield, Steve Jobs says of the App Store that “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mobile-industrys-never-seen-anything-like-this-an-interview-with-steve-jobs-at-the-app-stores-launch-1532527201?utm_source=Memberful&amp;amp;utm_campaign=5ed0c8b80c-daily_update_2018_08_23&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-5ed0c8b80c-110908273"&gt;we don’t expect this to be a big profit generator&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a57VCB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t expect this to be a big profit generator.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MjCntE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 8th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces that developers will be able to add &lt;a href="https://marco.org/2009/06/20/the-economics-of-in-app-purchase"&gt;in-app purchases &lt;/a&gt;using Apple’s payment processing (and 30 percent cut). It limits in-app purchases to paid apps, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpLdM3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 15th, 2009 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple changes its mind and allows &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/15/apple-announces-in-app-purchases-for-free-iphone-applications/"&gt;in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; to be extended to free apps. It drives a huge shift in business models for many games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3o6S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 1st, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/technology/01apple.html"&gt;Apple begins rejecting apps that don’t use its in-app purchasing system&lt;/a&gt;. It rejects Sony’s e-reader app. Apps are not allowed to link out to purchase or subscription pages within their apps, even if the user completes the purchase in a separate browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QrEf6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb. 15th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a big new push to bring news and magazines into Apple’s ecosystem, it &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/02/15Apple-Launches-Subscriptions-on-the-App-Store/"&gt;launches subscriptions on the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for publishers. Fees are still 30 percent, and Apple makes it easy to unsubscribe — and hard for publishers to gather data about their readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBJ7hA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 28th, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we learned in discovery for the recent &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;Apple executive suggests cutting App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; in an internal email on this date. As we all know, that didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf6GQ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jan. 15th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5311364/apple-settles-with-ftc-over-in-app-purchases-tim-cook-says"&gt;settles a case with the FTC over in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; and offers consumers $32 million in refunds. It’s a response to a raft of apps using tricky tactics to get in-app purchases. Over time, more parental controls, restraints on those purchases, and oversight on apps are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DL5TzJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 9th, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/19/7249917/apple-swaps-free-for-get-in-app-store"&gt;changes the button naming&lt;/a&gt; on the App Store from “free” to “get,” to better reflect that some games have in-app purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="jVhHJs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now we’re going to open up to all categories, and that includes games, which is a huge category.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQ5OLNmgzrmm0oFqQJh0vyzX4pY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13085425/jbareham_160607_1080_0005_final_02.0.0.1465351786.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cOkYA1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 16th, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a massive and consequential change to the app economy, Apple introduces a much-expanded model for subscriptions for apps. It was big enough that our article on the event dubbed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview"&gt;App Store 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. The changes included dropping Apple’s fee to 15 percent after the first year of subscription revenue. This is also when Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618044341/https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;the concept of the “reader app”&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial category that allowed users to access subscription content purchased elsewhere (like Netflix or Kindle) but disallowed linking out to those purchase options. Finally, Apple announced it would begin introducing ads in App Store search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSfemg"&gt;The change was so big that at that year’s WWDC, Apple &lt;a href="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/App-Review-Guidelines-The-Comic-Book.pdf"&gt;commissioned a graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; where the art told one story but all the text was literally the App Store rules. In one section, we see the story of a son getting a haircut for his father’s funeral while the captions list the “acceptable” business models in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whNxT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 1st, 2016 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 2020 House subcommittee investigation revealed that in 2016, Amazon has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;secret deal&lt;/a&gt; with Apple that grants it lower fees than were available to other developers. Earlier in 2020, Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;attempted to claim&lt;/a&gt; the deal was an “established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers.” Even if it was “established,” it certainly wasn’t widely known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvyZgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 5th, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;During its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple quietly updates its guidelines to allow for so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17430532/apple-app-store-rules-valve-steam-link-game-streaming"&gt;remote mirroring apps like Steam Link&lt;/a&gt;. It didn’t allow for full game services on the App Store, but carved out the ability to mirror a PC on an iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU1JZ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 28th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A controversy grows over Apple’s crackdown on developers who use enterprise tools for managing iPhones to offer parental controls to consumers. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report"&gt;Apple needed to publicly explain why it was banning those apps&lt;/a&gt;. The move was viewed as anti-competitive because Apple had its own parental controls. Apple countered that those enterprise tools could be misused by hackers in a consumer context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50sQQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 29th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple publishes a new webpage (since changed) titled &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190529141133/https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/principles-practices/"&gt;App Store Principles and Practices&lt;/a&gt;. It was essentially a marketing page designed to explain Apple’s rules for the App Store and why it believed those guidelines protected consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Varub9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 4th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18653142/apple-mdm-parental-control-screen-time-app-store-guidelines-update"&gt;another quiet update during WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, Apple updates its guidelines to allow enterprise tools to be used for parental controls, allowing them to use mobile device manager and VPN APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxrmCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 12th, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692228/apple-banned-parental-control-ourpact-mdm-app-store-control-back"&gt;Apple begins restoring banned parental control apps&lt;/a&gt; to the App Store following the controversy earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grKKJJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 1st, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the date we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;officially learned about the so-called “established” program&lt;/a&gt; for video streaming providers to bypass the 30 percent fee for individual video rentals and purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="fWLDrr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There is no chance in bloody hell that we're going to pay Apple's ransom. I will burn this house down myself, before I let gangsters like that spin it for spoils. This is profoundly, perversely abusive and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272972718384623616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oUzZY3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 22nd, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what turned out to be a big controversy for the App Store, an email app called Hey is banned because it did not offer a way to sign up for the $99 / year service inside the app itself. At issue was that “reader” app category — only those types of apps were allowed to use that business model and Apple said email didn’t count. On this date, Hey made a minor change to its app to skirt Apple’s requirement that apps provide functionality without an outside subscription and so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;Apple approves the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxM5cW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 6th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new battle, streaming games platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;Stadia and Microsoft’s xCloud are officially banned from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s ruling requires every game on the services to be submitted individually — a nonstarter for those services. Ultimately both would eventually return as browser-based apps after Apple quietly added the necessary Safari support for them to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTQiDD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 13th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicks &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; following Epic’s gambit to add its own in-app purchases to the game. It would kick off a huge battle — both in the court of public opinion and in actual court. The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case would turn out to be a major event in the App Store saga, revealing all sorts of internal emails and ultimately leading to consequential rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWPSH2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 18th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to hang on to its 30 percent cut but still grant smaller developers some concessions, Apple introduces the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;.” Developers who make less than $1 million per year were allowed to apply to join the program and have their cut reduced to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6fna"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 11th, 2020 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple makes it official that streaming game services are allowed in the App Store, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if each game inside the services are submitted individually&lt;/a&gt;. It is still not enough for Stadia and xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BjuyJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 23rd, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new 16-page report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546771/apple-side-loading-security-risk-report-regulatory-pressure"&gt;Apple lays out its arguments against allowing sideloading iPhone&lt;/a&gt; apps in a report titled “Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps,” claiming the practice would make its phones less secure and trustworthy for users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PpH2rR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has had to change more App Store policies between August 26th,2021 to September 10th than in any other period in its history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uw1ZMM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple announces another new program offering a lower rate to a subset of developers. Under the new program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;news publishers that participated in Apple News to a sufficient degree qualify for a 15 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; on their other apps instead of 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuZn3X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 26th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;settles a class action lawsuit with developers&lt;/a&gt;. In the proposed settlement, the company “clarifies” that developers are allowed to email their users directly with information about how they could subscribe to services outside the App Store. It’s unclear if this is actually a change and even if it is, it’s a tiny one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsgi0n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 31st, 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;new law in South Korea requires both Google and Apple to allow for third-party payment systems&lt;/a&gt; on apps in their respective app stores. It’s too soon to see how the companies will react and what the law’s effect both inside and outside South Korea will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtYNI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 1st, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another lawsuit settlement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle have a single link out to their payment services inside their apps.&lt;/a&gt; It’s a tiny crack in the so-called “anti-steering” rules, but it’s limited to a single link and limited to the so-called “reader apps” category that Apple itself has defined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZX3O9U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple rules that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;won’t allow &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to return to the App Store in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, despite the new law there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rBnZlc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;huge ruling in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the judge says that Apple is “permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.” It is also established that Apple does not have an illegal monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYUFPs"&gt;Appeals from both Epic and Apple are expected. &lt;/p&gt;
