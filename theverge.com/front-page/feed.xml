    <title>Netflix’s live-action Cowboy Bebop is canceled </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qp9NTTr_wfkv361cePuNBg3sBA=/0x252:2400x1852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70252399/COWBOYBEB_ArtDept_01192RC4__1__long.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;‘Cowboy Bebop’ cast | NICOLA DOVE/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eT6bPt"&gt;Netflix has canceled its live-action adaptation of the &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; anime. The show, starring Jon Cho as Spike Spiegel, will not be renewed for a second season &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/cowboy-bebop-canceled-netflix-1235060256/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Though a lot of shows on Netflix are not renewed, &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; alluded to the show’s poor reception as the reason for its abrupt cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIbgu7"&gt;Reviews of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; generally criticized the show’s weak pacing and cheap-looking costumes and sets while it also failed to capture the essence of what made the 1996 anime one of the best examples of the genre. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776962/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix"&gt;said the show&lt;/a&gt; eventually grew on him after failing in the first episodes while I, a &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; superfan, thought the show took some weird, but interesting risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYYwX9"&gt;The live-action adaptation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22463620/netflix-live-action-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho"&gt;was originally announced in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and premiered three weeks ago after dropping several trailers and a video of the opening credits which was a shot-for-shot remake of the anime’s iconic opening theme. There will be some plotlines that will be left hanging (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yyWgfLbW-M"&gt;Radical Edward!&lt;/a&gt;) by the sudden end of the show, but at least we got new Yoko Kanno music to enjoy so the show’s cancellation isn’t a total loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUjfFv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p29G1N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase will let users earn interest on crypto but not in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKEvjgThbQ0l3a6P5ZqH1nCYvGk=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70252320/1__9_tE5HVEXnSUwgJs75nUw.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hh7Dq6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-makes-it-easy-to-earn-yield-with-defi-bd38156e2715"&gt;Coinbase has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll let users earn interest on their cryptocurrency by lending it to a decentralized finance app called Compound (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/coinbase-launches-defi-yield-product-for-non-u-s-customers"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The program isn’t currently available to US users, though, after plans for a similar feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684169/coinbase-crypto-lend-feature-discontinued-sec-lawsuit-threats"&gt;got the company into trouble&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEqbrI"&gt;Coinbase says that customers in over 70 countries will be able to lend their Dai, a stablecoin whose value is tied to the US dollar, to borrowers from within its app. The process works using a protocol called Compound, which programmatically pools money from lenders and collects interest on that money from borrowers. Coinbase’s pitch is that it makes the system more user-friendly — lending through Compound &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kraken.com%2Fen-us%2Flearn%2Fwhat-is-compound-comp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826888%2Fcoinbase-defi-interest-non-us-compound-lending-program" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;usually involves&lt;/a&gt; receiving multiple tokens when you make a deposit and paying transaction fees whenever you put crypto in or take it out (Coinbase says it’ll be covering these fees for its users).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJRd7CbYG430QGvFf1te_0KDwFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23077318/1__9_tE5HVEXnSUwgJs75nUw.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Coinbase&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coinbase says you’ll be able to start earning interest with just a few taps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r0yDMU"&gt;The program is similar to Coinbase Lend, which the company announced in June but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684169/coinbase-crypto-lend-feature-discontinued-sec-lawsuit-threats"&gt;canceled in September&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange"&gt;SEC threatened to sue the company&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the feature would count as a security. Lend would have allowed users to earn interest on USDC, another stablecoin, though users would’ve been loaning it directly to Coinbase to manage instead of an outside protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaaGrh"&gt;Coinbase also promised that you’d get whatever money you put into Lend back, but the company isn’t making any such guarantees with this new program. It also warns users that losses are possible and make sure to point out that the interest rates are variable — Compound’s rates for DAI fluctuated between 2.83 and 5.39 percent throughout October, according to Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this investigation on the environmental racism of Amazon warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Amazon Fulfillment Center On Cyber Monday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WZq7AbyK_5r49jxFbE1GpBdzjUw=/0x0:6390x4260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70252292/1236892446.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PrE52l"&gt;Amazon is expanding its empire of warehouses at breakneck speed, and it’s building most of them in neighborhoods of color, according to a new investigation by Consumer Reports&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; That ultimately burdens Black and brown communities with the truck traffic, noise, and pollution that warehouses bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga8h7s"&gt;Almost 70 percent of Amazon warehouses in the US are in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of residents of color than what’s typical in other neighborhoods in the rest of the metro area, according to Consumer Reports. Fifty-seven percent of neighborhoods near Amazon warehouses have more low-income residents, too. To suss this out, Consumer Reports cross-referenced data from the Environmental Protection Agency, US Census Bureau, and a database of Amazon facilities that it purchased from a logistics consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MIeIlw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost 70 percent of Amazon warehouses in the US are in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of residents of color&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mQfLgF"&gt;“Our communities are being sacrificed in the name of economic development,” José Acosta-Córdova, an organizer at the Chicago-based nonprofit Little Village Environmental Justice Organization, told Consumer Reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIjFUl"&gt;E-commerce is largely responsible for more and bigger warehouses. Online retail giants, with Amazon leading the way, generally need huge warehouses rather than retail space to store and distribute goods. $1 billion in online sales translates to 1.25 million square feet of warehouse space demand, according to commercial real estate firm &lt;a href="https://www.cbre.us/research-and-reports/2021-US-Real-Estate-Market-Outlook-Industrial-Logistics"&gt;CBRE&lt;/a&gt;. With online shopping rising for years and the pandemic further accelerating the trend, warehouses have recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816131/warehouses-natural-gas-emissions-climate-change"&gt;eclipsed offices as the most common commercial building&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjJrOz"&gt;Amazon, in particular, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22404044/amazon-earnings-q1-2021-performance-profit-operating-income"&gt;made a killing&lt;/a&gt; in sales during the pandemic and drastically increased the number of warehouses it operates to keep up. It opened almost 300 new facilities in 2020, Consumer Reports found, compared to an average of 75 annually during the five years prior. Amazon’s warehouse footprint dwarfs other retailers: its new additions in 2020 alone are already two-thirds that of all of Walmart’s warehouse space. Amazon did not immediately provide comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgCs8n"&gt;The impacts of the warehouse boom will be felt most acutely by the Black, brown, and low-income communities where they’re going up. The Inland Empire, a once quiet community on the edge of Southern California’s deserts that’s now a warehouse hotspot, has the worst smog in the nation, &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/getmedia/17c6cb6c-8a38-42a7-a3b0-6744011da370/sota-2021.pdf"&gt;according to the American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s far from an outlier: research is finding that neighborhoods in California with warehouses have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;significantly worse air pollution&lt;/a&gt; than similar areas without warehouses. Poor air quality is linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.edf.org/health/health-impacts-air-pollution"&gt;litany of health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including asthma and heart attacks, placing communities that often are least able to afford good health care at greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YY7tRU"&gt;If the new Consumer Reports investigation is any indicator, the problem will get worse before it gets better. Go read the &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/corporate-accountability/when-amazon-expands-these-communities-pay-the-price-a2554249208/"&gt;full story&lt;/a&gt; here. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus launches new live channels hub for linear streaming </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Gx3viNkrZ2O5aMQW1p5IHFkQ6g=/151x0:1780x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70252163/Live_TV_Desktop_Star_Trek.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hgyyz9"&gt;Paramount Plus is rolling out its own linear channels feature that’ll serve up linear movies and TV with a similar feel to traditional cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLki6q"&gt;The new Live Channels feature launched on Paramount Plus today with more than a dozen curated 24/7 playlists for genres like crime and drama, as well as adult animation and kids programming. Some channels are dedicated entirely to a specific franchise, such as &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeEljT"&gt;The addition of Live Channels also allows Paramount Plus to more directly compete with streaming services that have similar live and linear integrations, including Peacock. Paramount Plus previously supported a Live TV hub for sports, breaking news, and programming from Entertainment Tonight. (Premium users can pay extra for coverage from their local CBS station.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6f0zvV"&gt;The linear programming hub was “informed by” ViacomCBS-owned free TV service Pluto TV, Tom Ryan, president and CEO of ViacomCBS Streaming, &lt;a href="https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/paramount-plus/releases/view?id=58796"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSy5vd"&gt;“Even in the era of on-demand, there is clearly a strong consumer appetite for reimagined linear channels that provide effortless, lean-back entertainment,” Ryan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9fU0j"&gt;Paramount Plus will continue to roll out additional channels, the company said, including a &lt;em&gt;RuPaul’s Drag Race&lt;/em&gt; channel and a dedicated movies channel — both of which will land on the service later this month. The full list of supported channels is as follows, per Paramount Plus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="U5kOoK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24/7 Laughs&lt;/strong&gt; — A destination for feel-good, laugh-out-loud content from popular series such as HOT IN CLEVELAND, RENO 911 and TOSH.O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7vmHsG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Voices&lt;/strong&gt; — A celebration of Black voices and stories with a collection of popular series such as CHAPPELLE’S SHOW, KEY &amp;amp; PEELE, THE GAME and THE NEIGHBORHOOD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhLeqW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime &amp;amp; Justice &lt;/strong&gt;— Primetime procedurals such as BULL, BLUE BLOODS, CSI: MIAMI, MACGYVER, SEAL TEAM and THE GOOD WIFE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOlTtf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History &amp;amp; Undiscovered&lt;/strong&gt; — A curated selection for historians from the Smithsonian Channel, including SACRED SITES, SECRETS, AMERICA’S HIDDEN STORIES and SECRETS UNLOCKED&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ts8v53"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; — The best moments from the hit reality series, including THE CHALLENGE and THE CHALLENGE: ALL-STARS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9l3ff4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TV Classics&lt;/strong&gt; — A curated selection of timeless series such as I LOVE LUCY, THE LOVE BOAT and THE TWILIGHT ZONE&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast now sells Xfinity Flex users internet cable TV from YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrwiM_klb8ozay2ZHEgUg-pZzBU=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251941/Web_Publishing_XfinityFlex_YouTubeTVLaunch_16x9_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NRDjUc"&gt;Comcast is introducing YouTube TV to its Xfinity Flex devices, providing users another avenue for opting out of traditional cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MgqhS"&gt;YouTube was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fxfinity-flex-overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826856%2Fcomcast-xfinity-flex-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previously supported&lt;/a&gt; on Comcast’s Flex boxes, but the addition of YouTube TV gives users the ability to get some 85-plus live television channels for $65 per month. It’s not the first live TV streaming service to arrive on the platform — Sling and Hulu with Live TV were already supported. But it does diversify the streaming options for people who don’t want to pay Comcast for cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpmBa5"&gt;Colin Petrie-Norris, senior vice president of consumer entertainment at Xfinity, said &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/youtube-tv-launches-on-xfinity-flex"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the addition of YouTube TV “is another example of how we surround our broadband service with value, giving our customers access to all their preferred content and subscriptions on one device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWItlR"&gt;It’s a curious move from a cable provider, but it also makes sense if Comcast wants to stay competitive against other over-the-top boxes like Roku, Fire TV Stick, or Chromecast — all of which support YouTube TV.

    <title>Peacock will stream NBCUniversal movies as soon as 45 days after theatrical release</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “majority” of films from Universal Filmed Entertainment Group will be available exclusively on Peacock.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TcTGec"&gt;NBCUniversal committed to adding the “majority” of films from Universal Pictures, Focus Features, Illumination, and DreamWorks Animation Films to its Peacock streaming service as soon as 45 days after they hit theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/interactive/2929fed4187b40648b79a9839e70e91fproduct169208/index.html#/brand/ddfffeac-5bfe-497f-9bfb-d359535d0079/press-releases/4149d711-2be9-4007-afe0-e35210fb8aee"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. The new strategy kicks off with its 2022 slate of films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJB6I6"&gt;This model means that movies including &lt;em&gt;The 355&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Halloween Ends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey: A New Era&lt;/em&gt; will be available on Peacock soon after they debut in theaters. However, some of the company’s bigger 2022 movies, including &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World: Dominion&lt;/em&gt; and Christopher Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Oppenheimer&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t expected to be part of this arrangement, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/universal-movie-theater-theatrical-window-1235130063/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t41J9g"&gt;Entertainment companies have been experimenting with release strategies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to help drive interest in their streaming services. WarnerMedia, for example, committed to releasing its entire 2021 slate of films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, though will return to theatrical exclusivity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;for its 2022 film releases&lt;/a&gt;. Disney made a handful of movies available on Disney Plus day-and-date with theaters for a fee as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;Premier Access program&lt;/a&gt;, though shifted to theatrical exclusivity for many of its 2021 films released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22668326/disney-movies-exclusive-theatrical-streaming-black-widow-eternals-johansson"&gt;in the year&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Build-A-Bear’s new Matrix Bear probably doesn’t know kung fu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0yA6eOuChkndm3KQt3Pgt_JNDs=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251820/matrixbear.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Enter the Bear-trix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5P2SqV"&gt;Build-A-Bear has announced its latest movie tie-in: an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Fonline-exclusive-matrix-bear-with-costume%2F329693_29694.html%3Fcgid%3Dshop-by-license-matrix&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826150%2Fbuild-a-bear-matrix-bear-neo-outfit-teddy-stuffed-animal-toy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;absolutely incredible-looking &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-themed bear&lt;/a&gt; (officially called “Matrix Bear”) just in time for the release of the upcoming fourth film in the absolutely-not-for-children film series, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKPz8X"&gt;Matrix Bear is unique among Build-A-Bear bears, with green and black fur patterned after the iconic “digital rain” effect from the films. It also features &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;logo on one of its feet, with an optional “hacker costume” outfit patterned after Neo’s garb from the films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cF39vR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Neo still knows kung fu in the latest trailer for The Matrix Resurrections","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820636/the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-neo-trinity-keanu-reeves-deja-vu-loop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mtq2qu"&gt;
&lt;p id="tO8oRc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXT. The Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxcrtt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus&lt;/strong&gt;: Let me tell you why you’re here, at the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop. You’re here because you know something. What you know you can’t explain, but you feel it. You’ve felt it your entire life, that there’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is, but it’s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I’m talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FlSzW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bear-trix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrO6Gp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you want to know what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUMc1o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmIvPH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Neo and Morpheus are both teddy bears in this scene)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2z6M3f"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aE3iV186EdAGNpmVyxLY54H7tCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076879/29693x.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VqkoP6"&gt;The new Matrix Bear is part of Build a Bear’s “The Bear Cave” lineup of bears and accessories intended for adult fans of stuffed animals, rather than the brand’s usual, more child-friendly products. That said, there is still some &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; cognitive dissonance in seeing a leather duster-clad stuffed animal decked out as Neo from the violent, R-rated films with a Bear-A-Bear workshop heart logo on its paw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Vn773"&gt;Matrix Bear isn’t cheap, either: the bear itself costs $29 on its own, while the &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; costume (which includes the coat and sunglasses outfit ) is an additional $22 on top, for a total of $51 for the full set. The Matrix Bear is also an online exclusive, so you won’t be able to go into an actual Build-A-Bear workshop and stuff your own Neo-lookalike teddy at your nearest suburban mall (which is probably for the best, all things considered).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Csqdh"&gt;The Neo-style bear is the only &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-themed outfit that Build-A-Bear offers, which is bad news for anyone hoping to round out their collection with Trinity or Morpheus bears. Although, technically, there’s nothing stopping you (other than financial responsibility and common sense, that is) from getting a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Ftimeless-teddy-business-suit-gift-set%2F26518_27532_20666.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826150%2Fbuild-a-bear-matrix-bear-neo-outfit-teddy-stuffed-animal-toy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;few dozen extra bears in a bunch of matching suits&lt;/a&gt; to recreate the Neo / Agent Smith clone fight from &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; in stop-motion with an army of stuffed animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1Pxrt8"&gt;
&lt;p id="3KlRI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INT. Neo and Morpheus (still talking teddy bears) continue their conversation by the FLUFF ME STATION inside the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5FhLf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Bear-trix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to school... when you go to the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop... when you pay for your new fuzzy friend at the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpVdZJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo&lt;/strong&gt;: What truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJFSoF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus: &lt;/strong&gt;That you are a bear, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into being a furry ball of fluff. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ9XbI"&gt;END SCENE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jUd5Hg"&gt;
&lt;p id="1TtiHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbg0Er"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teL2Mz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv5S7x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft quietly told Apple it was willing to turn big Xbox-exclusive games into iPhone apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i9cVe1ppyQ6-8z8vFKiO3cyOTuA=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251798/xcloud.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Private emails show Microsoft wheeling and dealing to get into the App Store&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="E3Oank"&gt;Remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;when Apple pretended like&lt;/a&gt; it would let cloud gaming services like Microsoft xCloud and Google Stadia into the App Store, while effectively tearing their business models to shreds? Know how Microsoft replied that forcing gamers to download hundreds of individual apps to play a catalog of cloud games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;would be a bad experience&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDCMx8"&gt;In reality, Microsoft was willing to play along with many of Apple’s demands — and it even offered to bring triple-A, Xbox-exclusive games to iPhone to help sweeten the deal. That’s according to a new set of private emails that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; unearthed in the aftermath of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfYI2X"&gt;These games would have run on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) platform, streaming from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade"&gt;remote server farms filled with Xbox One and Xbox Series X processors&lt;/a&gt; instead of relying on the local processing power of your phone. If the deal had been made, you could have theoretically bought a copy of a game like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in Apple’s App Store itself and launched it like any other app — instead of having to pay $14.99 a month for an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription with a set catalog of games and then needing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;use Microsoft’s web-based App Store workaround&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCr70L"&gt;But primarily, Microsoft was negotiating to bring its Netflix-esque catalog of xCloud games to the App Store, at a time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;when Apple had gotten &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; touchy&lt;/a&gt; about cloud gaming in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hi5NMy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s what Apple’s new rules about cloud gaming actually mean","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"},{"title":"Microsoft snubs Apple’s olive branch to cloud gaming: ‘a bad experience for customers’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5QKg9g"&gt;The emails, between Microsoft Xbox head of business development Lori Wright and several key members of Apple’s App Store teams, show that Microsoft &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; start with a wide array of concerns about stuffing an entire service worth of Xbox games into individual App Store apps as of February 2020. Wright mentioned the “Complexity &amp;amp; management of creating hundreds to thousands of apps,” how they’d have to update every one of those apps to fix any bugs, and how all those app icons could lead to cluttered iOS homescreens, among other worries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="72d3BC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHJwJS"&gt;“We believe that the issues described here will create frustration and confusion for customers, resulting in a sub-par experience on Apple devices relative to the equivalent experience on all other platforms,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbVhIc"&gt;But by March of last year, Microsoft was proposing that it could, actually, create those hundreds or thousands of individual apps to submit to the App Store — as long as it could make those apps a bit more like shortcuts, instead of stuffing the whole cloud gaming streaming stack into each one. She argued that’s similar to how watchOS apps already worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDVQ1w"&gt;“If we have a single streaming tech app, it will be around 150 MB, but the other apps will only be roughly 30 MB and will not need to be updated when the streaming tech is updated. This will be a better experience for users,” Wright wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6eFWOk24KmQ465a08tnAdDOkI7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076481/lori_wright_xcloud_microsoft_email_apple_streaming_stack.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wright explains that Microsoft is “close to finding a solve” to bring Xbox games to iOS as App Store apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enNv0G"&gt;That’s also when Wright pulled out the idea of bringing exclusive triple-A Xbox games to iOS, arguing that they, too, would need “the streaming tech package as a separate app to deliver the right experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibh3oU"&gt;“This would be an incredibly exciting opportunity for iOS users to get access to these exclusive AAA titles in addition to the Game Pass games,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LE6Cm8"&gt;Obviously, none of this happened. Microsoft rejected Apple’s new App Store guidelines in September 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;announced the web workaround version of xCloud&lt;/a&gt; a month later. It arrived this April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRGtCU"&gt;Where did negotiations break down? Microsoft now tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple was actually the one that rejected &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; proposals — because Apple insisted on forcing each and every game to include the full streaming stack and wouldn’t agree to anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ANTUQu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Forcing each game to include our streaming tech stack proved to be unrealistic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amS8gi"&gt;“Our proposal for bringing games through individual apps was designed to comply with App Store policies. It was denied by Apple based on our request that there be a single streaming tech app to support the individual game apps, as the initial email states. Forcing each game to include our streaming tech stack proved to be unrealistic from a support and engineering perspective and would create an incredibly negative experience for customers,” reads a statement from Xbox Cloud Gaming CVP Kareem Choudhry to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83oXGi"&gt;Late last April, Apple’s App Store games manager Mark Grimm suggested that might not be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason the companies didn’t reach an understanding — it might have something to do with money as well. He told colleagues that Microsoft was actually now entertaining the idea of including the streaming code in individual Xbox games on the App Store. “[Wright] was far more positive and was trying to pressure her engineering team into finding a way to put the entire streaming stack into each binary,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzFK5cIx12V37mIWIzLmnC8V70k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076821/apple_grimm_email.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grimm goes on to suggest that Apple’s agreed role in negotiations was to “take the IAP problem back and figure something out,” but it sounds like that didn’t happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TXgaGZ"&gt;But there was also a concern that Microsoft didn’t want to put in-app purchases into each game: “Their proposal for IAPs is still that they process all IAPs on their existing system and settle up with us (either in real-time or monthly),” wrote Grimm, stating the opinion that Apple should let Microsoft’s games bypass IAP. “They’re not trying to circumvent &lt;em&gt;paying us&lt;/em&gt;, they’re trying to circumvent a large amount of redundant API work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="F2jdvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re not trying to circumvent &lt;em&gt;paying us”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SLzwTA"&gt;And Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that money was indeed involved. “Unfortunately, Microsoft proposed a version of xCloud that was not compliant with our App Store Review Guidelines, specifically the requirement to use in-app purchase to unlock additional features or functionality within an app,” reads a statement via Apple spokesperson Adam Dema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr8Qc5"&gt;Microsoft’s Choudhry denies that IAP came into the final decision. “The reasons for rejection were unrelated to in-app purchase capabilities; we currently provide Xbox Cloud Gaming through a singular Xbox Game Pass app in the Google Play Store without IAP enabled, for example, and we would do the same through the App Store if allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZQh0w"&gt;Here’s Choudhry’s general statement on the entire matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EMeJSY"&gt;We explored many options to bring Cloud Gaming via Xbox Game Pass to Apple devices, always in ways that led with the customer experience first, which we believed was best through a singular app. Apple’s Store policies would have forced us to launch each game as an individual app—while we never favored that approach, we explored it as a possibility in the spirit of finding any solution to bring Cloud Gaming to iOS customers. However between that email in March 2020 and our statement to The Verge in September 2020, Apple rejected our proposals and we were left without the ability to release a cohesive Xbox Game Pass offering through the App Store. We shifted our engineering priorities and have now moved to a browser-based solution making Xbox Cloud Gaming available to iOS customers through web browsers, and will continue to look for viable resolutions that allow us into the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="auPX2d"&gt;As for the possibility of bringing triple-A Xbox exclusives to the iPhone and iPad as individual games, he confirms: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3fC3gA"&gt;“In addition to Xbox Game Pass, we were also open to bringing select individual games to iOS as we do today with titles like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy pulls TCL Google TVs amid complaints of slow, buggy software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/speHBcienQnWeFQXFBYRIf-kme4=/20x0:2168x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251693/327063D4_692F_4275_A45A_6A2026E0BFEF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VaLJJm"&gt;Back in late summer, TCL announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;upgraded version of its high-end 6-Series TV&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from some technical improvements — the newer set fully supports HDMI 2.1 and 4K gaming at 120Hz — the biggest change had to do with software, with the latest 6-Series running Google TV instead of the Roku OS that has shipped on many of TCL’s most popular sets in the United States. The company has already released TVs powered by Android TV internationally and on a few budget models in North America, but the 2021 6-Series was meant to be a combined showcase for TCL hardware and Google software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkl6Du"&gt;So far, it’s not working out that way, and things aren’t going quite as well as TCL might’ve hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqmHWT"&gt;Some early buyers of the 6-Series with Google TV (model R646) have complained about what they describe as a buggy, sluggish user interface. I myself have been reviewing a 65-inch model over the past couple weeks, and while the Google TV home screen seems to work relatively well, it didn’t take long for me to notice some general slowness when pulling up and going through the settings menu. There can also be a lag before the TV reacts to remote control commands. My roommates have observed crashing apps and a few instances where the TV itself froze and became unresponsive. Some online reviews cite more annoying problems that require unplugging the TV altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAcBz9"&gt;Similar early criticisms have also been leveled at the 5-Series with Google TV; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1RPvpz5H0U4"&gt;Caleb at &lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found his review unit to be on the slow side and ran into several bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZeQ5novFx3uBWAhquLlHq4PFo-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076791/E4A32016_080D_41C0_8688_6F461E5E3C4E.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tcltvs/comments/r9yiux/will_the_google_tv_os_get_faster_on_the_s546_new/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; about the 5-Series with Google TV is equally applicable to the 6-Series.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ulo5vT"&gt;TCL has already rolled out several software updates meant to improve performance and stability. “Our priority is to deliver an optimized user experience with Google TV and have a cadence of planned software updates for TCL devices,” TCL spokesperson Rachelle Parks told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in late November. Some of those updates do seem to have made a positive difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5nH2w"&gt;But as of this week, Best Buy — the exclusive US retailer of the TCL Google TVs — has abruptly removed both models from its store listings. &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/home-theater/6-series/55-class-6-series-4k-qled-hdr-smart-google-tv-55r646"&gt;TCL’s own website&lt;/a&gt; has a link to Best Buy that no longer works. Prior to the removal, the 65-inch 6-Series I’m testing &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Freviews%2Ftcl-65-class-6-series-mini-led-qled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv%2F6470277&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had an average review rating of 3.5 stars&lt;/a&gt;. Many reviews praise the panel and Mini LED picture quality but go on to list issues encountered with the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq3o3k"&gt;While TCL is familiar with Android TV, the Google TV software experience is new territory for the company, and clearly, it’s having a rough go at this early stage. I hope a lot of the performance issues can be ironed out with more updates; this really is a fantastic TV, with terrific peak brightness and excellent contrast thanks to that Mini LED backlighting. But it’s not where it needs to be right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX4StJ"&gt;In fact, I’ve already gone ahead and plugged an Apple TV 4K into one of the HDMI ports just to avoid the sluggishness and jank. Streaming devices are a great way to speed up budget TVs, but they shouldn’t be a necessary bandaid for a TV with an MSRP of over $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S60Fdn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to both TCL and Best Buy for more details. This could be a supply shortage situation (though it’d be odd for the pages to completely vanish in that case), or maybe TCL is taking a beat to assess next steps for its new Google TVs to turn around their buggy early reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DN-viq88iRgLXKnBD9TUqV9LjhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251636/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyTsr3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the fact that there was no requirement for a time period, the agreement clearly stated "in a prominent and visible location on the People site".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f6ksV6"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also ignored changes to the settlement requested by the NLRB. Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788245/cher-scarlett-apple-nlrb-settlement-leaves-company-appletoo-pay-equity"&gt;left the company in November&lt;/a&gt;, after filing the complaint that accused the company of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” While at the company, she worked to let employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;discuss and gather data about pay equity&lt;/a&gt; and was part of #AppleToo, a campaign about the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;failure to deal with harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
