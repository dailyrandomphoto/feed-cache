    <title>Valorant’s new tournament series is aimed at making its esports scene more diverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hgIFEdtGoY9_Nub1aZG8b7VjMvo=/96x0:1131x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861829/0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4QuIm"&gt;2021 is a big year for competitive &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, with developer Riot kicking off an ambitious, yearlong esports circuit called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612562/valorant-champions-tour-esports-2021"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Champions Tour&lt;/a&gt;. But the company is also looking to make the scene more diverse with a separate competition called VCT Game Changers, which it says will “create competitive opportunities for women and marginalized genders within &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CDtjI"&gt;The program will include a series of “top tier” competitions throughout 2021, but perhaps more important is an academy series designed to foster new talent. Here’s how Riot describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WG1o3u"&gt;The VCT Game Changers Academy program will host monthly tournaments, giving players even more opportunities to compete at the semi-pro and grassroots level. Academy events will be organized in partnership with GALORANTs, one of the largest communities within &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;. GALORANTs previously helped organize the “For the Women Summer Showdown” tournament in September 2020. Both the VCT Game Changers Series and Academy will help build the next generation of leaders who aspire to succeed with the competitive &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ejWQgf"&gt;Women-centric esports competitions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925850/girl-gamer-esports-festival-madrid-league-of-legends-fortnite-overwatch"&gt;aren’t a new phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;, as the scene is still largely male-dominated across the biggest games, whether it’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17011504/overwatch-league-first-woman-player-geguri-shanghai-dragons"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751540/fortnite-world-cup-women-esports-gen-g-faze-clan-ewok"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But as a relatively new game, having launched last year, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; is in a potentially good place to cultivate a more diverse player base. In fact, there are already positive signs; when esports organization Evil Geniuses entered the professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; scene, it did so with a mixed-gender roster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1sfL"&gt;“Competing in games as a woman can be a daunting task, oftentimes resulting in a very real competitive disadvantage,” &lt;em&gt;Valorant &lt;/em&gt;executive producer Anna Donlon said in a statement. “While we’re addressing this challenge in-game, with improvements to chat, voice communications, and mitigation of griefing, we also see an opportunity to take another step with esports.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT8RwR"&gt;Riot says the program will be a “year-long effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Kiyo Pro doesn’t deliver all the goods a $200 webcam should</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This lens-shaped webcam has some tricks up its sleeve, but at a high cost&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ltQ2OA"&gt;Razer has released a swath of products so far during the pandemic, but its new Kiyo Pro might have the widest appeal of them all. It’s a new $199 webcam that looks like a lens ripped off a mirrorless camera, aimed to give Logitech’s Brio some good competition in the specs department. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/7/14531452/logitech-brio-4k-pro-webcam"&gt;four-year-old Brio&lt;/a&gt; is still the ideal choice if you value 4K capture and Windows Hello authentication, but the Kiyo Pro is no slouch, capable of streaming or recording 1080p footage at up to 60 frames per second, with an optional HDR mode that displays at 30 frames per second. Razer’s new webcam is a more compact alternative, and it has a few other features that might make it worth considering if you want a high-end webcam for more than just joining Zoom calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j37Vsy"&gt;The Kiyo Pro is being positioned as a good choice both for jumping into a meeting and for people who have hobbies or careers broadcasting their faces. It’s backing up that claim with a few features that I’ve been able to test over the past few days. One of them is its adjustable field of view (FOV), letting you swap between 80 degrees for a tighter crop of your face, a midrange 90-degree shot, or up to a super-wide 103 degrees. The latter option is nice if more than one person is in the shot or if you want to show off your living space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh8I4C"&gt;You can adjust these settings and more from within Razer’s Synapse, though annoyingly, that software didn’t always reflect changes I made to the settings in the camera preview. Strangely, I had to join a Zoom call to see changes take effect. I understand there are people who don’t want to fuss with software, and so you know, this is a plug-and-play device for Windows 10 and macOS. That said, it’ll be at a fixed FOV, and the suite of settings that I detail below won’t be available to you unless you get Razer’s software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IoKnK4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10355570"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3XFFf"&gt;This webcam features a 2.1-megapixel CMOS IMX327 autofocusing sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, covered in a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3, which is admittedly an odd feature for a camera that doesn’t move. It utilizes Sony’s Starvis technology, typically used in security cams, that makes it good at picking out details in low light and balancing light sources for a true-to-life picture. I was impressed with its ability to automatically make the dreadful lighting in my basement studio apartment look alright, with a few small tweaks by me in the brightness and saturation departments). So, I imagine people with ideal lighting will fare even better and possibly not have to adjust settings at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PoiAjt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;noticeably smoother and more detailed than any laptop webcam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aiFIRQ"&gt;During some Zoom calls with the Kiyo Pro, none of the participants were blown away by the visual fidelity. They did, however, remark that it’s noticeably smoother and more detailed in terms of color accuracy than any laptop webcam, and especially given my apartment’s lighting situation (almost all artificial lights, with little natural light coming in), my picture looked lively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jz4Fh49d_k_KD3DsTQVRFtJtxjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320630/Kiyo_12200_R1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kiyo Pro connects via USB-C, shipping with USB-C to Type-A cable and a lens cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYIDfk"&gt;Even with a bright window behind me that usually gets over-exposed by just about any laptop’s webcam, this camera balanced my apartment’s lighting without blowing out the background or dropping off in terms of detail. If you’re a game streamer with a vibrant set of colorful LEDs set up around your rig, this feature should be beneficial to you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afQNKp"&gt;The autofocus works relatively quickly, and it didn’t have to spend long clearing up the shot when I held an object close to the sensor, then pulled it away so it could refocus on my face. However, the autofocus tends to jump around a lot, hunting for a clearer shot even if I’m barely moving. This was perhaps the most annoying part of the experience for me, but it’s a small consolation that Synapse lets you set it to manual focus if you don’t plan to move all that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpJWJp"&gt;This webcam features omnidirectional microphones, though I highly recommend using a dedicated microphone or a headset equipped with one instead. What’s built into the Kiyo Pro is good in a pinch, and there’s a good amount of bass and clarity in my voice, but it’s a little quiet and echo-y by default. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8bca6H4ql71R6eQMT4B48MpnuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22319959/cfaulkner_210219_4432_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resist the urge to twist the Kiyo Pro like a traditional camera lens. It’s unfortunately just for show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYxWKH"&gt;Razer’s Kiyo Pro is a competent webcam with a few unique traits. At $200, it obviously can’t compete with the fidelity of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21244380/webcam-camera-how-to-dslr-mirrorless-capture-card-usb-hdmi"&gt;DSLR or mirrorless camera that’s been repurposed as a webcam&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281765/webcam-phone-tablet-android-ios-pc-mac-how-to"&gt;a modern smartphone with webcam apps installed&lt;/a&gt;. But for the cost, it should stack up better than it does to Logitech’s Brio released in 2017. Instead, Razer made an equally pricey webcam with fewer features. If webcams ever become as tough to find in stock as they were in early 2020, it’ll be nice to have another option on the market. But presently, it’s tough to recommend this model outright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony says more PlayStation games are coming to PC, starting with Days Gone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mwz-bopM4jv5tarr1rw74MMMYzQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861684/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="18kXom"&gt;Sony is planning to bring more of its PlayStation games to PC. First up will be &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt; this spring, Sony president and chief executive officer Jim Ryan told &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/playstation-vr-jim-ryan-interview-2021"&gt;British &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Developer Bend Studio also confirmed the news via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BendStudio/status/1364232428223533058"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, adding: “Stay tuned for more details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBwu23"&gt;In the past, Sony has shown reluctance to port games to PC, though it notably eased its stance last year when it announced Guerilla Games’ &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn &lt;/em&gt;would receive a PC port, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/3/21312588/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-august-7-features-sony"&gt;launched last August&lt;/a&gt;. Asked why the company seems to have changed its tune, Ryan told the publication that there are a few factors at play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9yH3W2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Surprise. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DaysGone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DaysGone&lt;/a&gt; comes to PC this spring. Stay tuned for more details. &lt;a href="https://t.co/vcSYSKgOtn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vcSYSKgOtn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bend Studio #DaysGone (@BendStudio) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BendStudio/status/1364232428223533058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PmcXGO"&gt;“We find ourselves now in early 2021 with our development studios and the games that they make in better shape than they’ve ever been before,” he said. “Particularly from the latter half of the PS4 cycle our studios made some wonderful, great games. There’s an opportunity to expose those great games to a wider audience and recognize the economics of game development, which are not always straightforward. The cost of making games goes up with each cycle, as the calibre of the IP has improved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgE00K"&gt;Ryan added it’s easier as well to make PS games available to non-console owners, making it “a fairly straightforward decision for us to make.” It’s still unclear which other PlayStation titles might make the jump to PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MC4cUm"&gt;Sony is encouraging PS4 and PS5 owners to stay at home during the pandemic by &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/23/play-at-home-returns-four-months-of-offers-for-playstation-games-and-entertainment-begin-march-1/#sf243317060"&gt;bringing back its “Play At Home” initiative&lt;/a&gt;, allowing PlayStation owners to redeem free games starting in March and concluding in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lON8AJ"&gt;Starting March 1st at 8PM PT / 11PM ET until March 31st at 8PM PT / 11PM ET, both PS4 and PS5 owners will have the chance to redeem 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt; at no cost; PS5 owners previously had access to a free version of the game via the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzlVUB"&gt;Sony originally announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220964/sony-ps4-uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-free-home"&gt;Play At Home initiative last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the company offered PS4 owners free digital copies of &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike the free PlayStation Plus games that are available each month, you do not need an active PlayStation Plus subscription to redeem or access these titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecg2aG"&gt;Additionally, Sony is also offering extended access for new users subscribed to the anime streaming services &lt;a href="https://funimation.8u86.net/c/482924/955859/4688?subId1=VergePlayStationFreeGames2021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.funimation.com%2Fsubscribe%2F"&gt;Funimation&lt;/a&gt; or Wakanim. The promotion for this is only available to people who sign up and download the respective app available in their country. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation boss says PS5 supply will start to pick up in the second half of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdxgecx8f-3eHY1PZW89FGBxv5A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861470/vpavic_4278_20201030_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="threads_view_CQ1J4TN8G-1614089772.007600-1614090283.010700"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; (alongside the Xbox Series X and S) has been nearly impossible to buy since its launch back in November. Those shortages will likely continue for a bit longer, according to Jim Ryan, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. But stock should pick up in the second half of the year, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ0egt"&gt;The news comes from a series of interviews with Ryan from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/02/23/ps5-vr/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7c089dc-515e-4387-82fd-ea0a49998650"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;where the PlayStation boss reflected on the past several months since the PS5’s launch and the road ahead for the next-generation console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dX3OiT"&gt;“Demand was greater than we anticipated,” Ryan said, explaining the ongoing stock issues for the console. “That, along with the complexities of the supply chain issues, resulted in a slightly lower supply than we initially anticipated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kjGTVS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Demand was greater than we anticipated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K2kkR0"&gt;Things will eventually improve, although it may take some time. “It will get better every month throughout 2021,” Ryan &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7c089dc-515e-4387-82fd-ea0a49998650"&gt;commented to the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The pace of the improvement in the supply chain will gather throughout the course of the year, so by the time we get to the second half of [2021], you’re going to be seeing really decent numbers indeed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6VSEz"&gt;That said, Ryan wouldn’t promise that there would be enough stock for everyone who wants a console to get one this holiday season. The high demand for PS5s, combined with the ongoing global semiconductor shortage and the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing most console sales through bot-infested online portals, means Sony is still facing serious constraints in how many people will actually be able to buy a PS5. “There are very few magic wands that can be waved,” notes Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Drm0Y"&gt;Still, Sony is already seeing encouraging numbers in the breakdown of customers who have been able to buy a PS5. According to Ryan, 1 in 4 PS5 owners didn’t own a PlayStation 4 console, and half of all PS5 owners are new to PSN. (Sony’s online account system that the company has used since the PlayStation 3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="seVOvW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X will be in short supply until at least June, Microsoft admits","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EShm56"&gt;Sony isn’t the only one hoping that next-generation console supplies will pick up in the second half of the year either. Mike Spencer, Microsoft’s head of investor relations, recently revealed that the new Xbox consoles will likely see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;supply constraints through at least June&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/ps5-xbox-console-shortage.html"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rode’s new compact wireless audio kit records two microphones with one receiver </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/asT3P2MDlIIY5l-_VuHXumrNM5Q=/75x0:918x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861458/RODE_WIRELESS_GO_II_instiu_3_couple_iphone_vloggerkit_jan_2021_1000x562.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;RODE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R9uIca"&gt;Rode has released a sequel to its Wireless Go mobile microphone system, &lt;a href="https://rode.com/microphones/wireless/wirelessgoii"&gt;the Wireless Go II&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to offer an easy way for video creators to record audio from two people at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1awqCn"&gt;Like its predecessor, the Go II is a compact wireless microphone pack designed for the creator who wants a lighter gear bag in the field (or is on a budget), while still being able to use a dedicated off-camera audio system. With this next generation, the Go II now offers dual channel recording for two sources, an extended wireless range for a more stable transmission, and on-board recording capabilities as a failsafe alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gn9OU"&gt;For dual channel recording, Rode includes two separate clip-on transmitters in the box — both with an on-board omnidirectional condenser microphone or a 3.5mm TRS input for plugging in a separate lavalier microphone — which transmits to a single receiver. That receiver can record both microphone packs in stereo and output the audio via USB-C to a phone or computer, or via 3.5mm analog TRS to a separate recorder or camera input. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJJNnGc0snckOKpSmjF-71q7KBo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22321971/rode_wireless_go_II_hero_image_jan_2021_2000_1334_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rode&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rode Wireless Go II: two transmitters, one receiver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PhXgsJ"&gt;Since an external lavalier is not included, the built-in microphones on the top of the transmitter are what most users will be relying on. In most practices this is hard to cover up on camera, unless you don’t mind an almost two-inch black square or a one-inch thick clip with a fuzzy windshield on the talent’s lapel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqALb4"&gt;The Wireless Go II’s on-board recording system can save up to 24 hours of audio internally without the need of an SD card (though the batteries will only last up to seven hours), while keeping the multitrack recording separate for post-production. The new model offers an extended wireless range of up to 200m (656 feet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YafB2"&gt;With these added features, Rode’s Wireless Go II should help to ease the stress of audio issues that plague the average sound operator — making sure microphones are picking up multiple sources, avoiding any RF interference from uncontrollable environments, and having a backup for any audio data lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAkMKI"&gt;Rode’s Wireless Go II &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1622642-REG%2Frode_wigoii_wireless_go_ii_compact.html#donotlink"&gt;is now available for $299&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDyWQx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gran Turismo 7 release date pushed back to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WV4BWbQC24xJpOH1nlTGr5wyfEM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861448/maxresdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GLvu1"&gt;The next entry in Polyphony Digital’s long-running &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; franchise has been delayed to 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/playstation-vr-jim-ryan-interview-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GQ &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement, Sony said &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; has been impacted by “COVID-related production challenges,” which means its planned 2021 release date has been shifted to 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0l5mj"&gt;“With the ongoing pandemic, it’s a dynamic and changing situation and some critical aspects of game production have been slowed over the past several months,” the statement reads. “We’ll share more specifics on &lt;em&gt;GT7&lt;/em&gt;’s release date when available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AN1D1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ll share more specifics on GT7’s release date when available”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxSLLh"&gt;News of the game’s delay came on the same day that Sony announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;next-gen virtual reality headset for the PS5&lt;/a&gt;. Although it’s yet to reveal an official name for the new device, or even a release date, Sony says the new headset will feature an improved field of view, a higher resolution, and will work with a new VR controller that’ll inherit some features from the PS5’s DualSense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXH700"&gt;Sony announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21275346/gran-turismo-7-ps5-sony-playstation-5-polyphony-digital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; for the PS5 last year&lt;/a&gt;, and later in the year announced plans to release the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556505/sony-ps5-horizon-forbidden-west-release-date-ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-2021"&gt;in the first half of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the first numbered game in the series since &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 6&lt;/em&gt; was released in 2013 for the PS3, although Sony released &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/em&gt; for the PS4 in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make your own speedy USB-C drive for cheap with this $100 SanDisk 1TB NVMe SSD</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vn4yTE"&gt;There’s a wide variety of deals happening in the tech space, including TVs, computer components, and more. Starting with a gadget that’ll give you some fast transfer speeds, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733115867493280374" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SanDisk’s Ultra 1TB NVMe SSD is $100&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy. That’s a great price for this kind of capacity, given it’s much faster than your standard SATA SSD. SanDisk covers this model with a five-year warranty. In terms of how you can use it, make sure your PC’s motherboard has an open M.2 2280 slot, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18518127/portable-ssd-external-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-samsung-x5-t5-specs-test-how-to"&gt;get crafty and buy an M.2 enclosure&lt;/a&gt; to turn it into a fast, compact external drive like the one shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQ1ry7"&gt;Someday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;Sony will enable the PS5’s M.2 slot&lt;/a&gt; for an SSD of this size and shape, but until it does I wouldn’t recommend buying one expressly for that reason. Just to note: some folks on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/hww8re/ssd_sandisk_ultra_1tb_internal_pci_express_30_x4/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; say this model isn’t particularly great compared to more expensive options because it apparently lacks DRAM cache, but it should still get the job done for most people. Perhaps not for you, though, if you’re looking for the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IZkmNA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10357138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZRZPW"&gt;Best Buy has marked down Hisense’s 75-inch 4K HDR TV to a staggeringly low price, as it’s done before. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733116916848559515" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $600&lt;/a&gt;, and considering the size alone it’s a good deal. This model also features Android TV, so you don’t need to hook up any external streaming devices to start watching TV or a movie. This TV is a good value, though it’s a little bare-bones in the spec department, with an LED panel that has a 60Hz refresh rate with no local dimming. Review site &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/h6510g"&gt;Rtings.com&lt;/a&gt; says it has a very good contrast ratio, so it’s ideal for movies, but it has narrow viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3fWRuU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSTZDV"&gt;Woot is selling refurbished, unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/VergeMakeOwnUSBCDrive022321/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-iphone-xr-64gb-fully-unlocked-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone XR phones with 64GB of storage for $330&lt;/a&gt;. The black and red colors are available. These are said to be in “Grade A” condition, which Woot classifies as “having minimal cosmetic damage, which is not noticeable when the device is held at arm’s length.” For context around the price, the newer iPhone SE with a faster processor is $399, so the iPhone XR is a little outdated in that regard, though it does have the advantage of screen real estate over the SE.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social networks are finally competitive again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TguMysnXGZVEE4aozQKvTcNghlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861287/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woILZx"&gt;Lately, the consumer internet — that set of products devoted to building and monetizing large networks of people — has started to feel rather buzzy. A space that had been largely emptied out over the past five years is once again humming with life. The products are compelling enough, and growing fast enough, that Facebook and others have begun trying to reverse-engineer and copy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohUdVS"&gt;It still doesn’t seem quite real to me, and yet everywhere I look the signs are there: social networks are competitive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2tXbE"&gt;Today, let’s tour this weird new landscape and talk about what it means — and doesn’t mean — for the tech giants and the governments trying to rein them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gSqyn3"&gt;I. &lt;strong&gt;How competition ended&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5fsoC"&gt;If I had to put a date on when competition ended among social networks in the United States, I’d choose August 2nd, 2016. That’s when Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;introduced its copy of Snapchat stories&lt;/a&gt;, blunting the momentum of an upstart challenger and sending a chill through the startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2w8Ts"&gt;I don’t think copying features is necessarily anti-competitive — in fact, as I’ll argue below, it’s a sign that the ecosystem is working as intended — but the effect of Facebook’s copying here was dramatic. Snap fell into a long funk, and would-be entrepreneurs and investors got the message: Facebook will seek to acquire or copy any upstart social product, dramatically limiting its odds of breakout success. Investment shrunk accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvqjbT"&gt;The previous year, after the success of Twitter’s Periscope app, Facebook had cloned its live video features, and enthusiasm for both products seemed to broadly peter out. When live group video experienced momentary success under Houseparty, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15916850/facebook-houseparty-clone-bonfire-group-video-chat"&gt;Facebook cloned that too&lt;/a&gt;, and Houseparty later sold to Epic Games for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4bUtg"&gt;It was in this stagnant environment that many people, myself included, came to believe that it had been a mistake to let Facebook acquire Instagram and WhatsApp. The former became the breakout social network of a younger generation, and the latter cemented Facebook’s global dominance in communication. A world in which both had remained independent would have been much more competitive, even if neither had grown to the scale that they did under Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aun7C3"&gt;This is the basic thesis of &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;, which it filed in December. The government argues that Facebook “is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct,” and if successful, it could force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp. It’s a tricky case; &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/facebook-sued-by-ftc-and-states-the-ftcs-case-antitrust-and-politics/"&gt;as Ben Thompson explains here&lt;/a&gt;, the government’s attempt to define the market in which Facebook competes so as to prove it has a monopoly is rather tortured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xs3JKG"&gt;You can think the FTC’s case against Facebook is weak and also believe that the period from 2016 to 2021 saw remarkably little innovation among American social networks, at least in terms of the basic user behaviors that they inspire. The market for social products became incredibly concentrated; Facebook and Google built a duopoly in digital advertising; and their vast size and unpredictable effects helped to trigger a global backlash against American tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeAzrl"&gt;If, like me, you think this is all a problem, you could argue for one of two basic approaches to fixing it. The first is government intervention, in the form of an antitrust lawsuit or new regulations from Congress, that would regulate the ability of tech giants to acquire smaller companies or put up new barriers to entering the market or competing on fair terms. The second is to do basically nothing, trusting that the entropic nature of the universe and the inexorable march of time would eventually restore competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jN63zy"&gt;If the second choice sounds ridiculous, it is not without precedent. In the late 1990s, Microsoft’s dominance over the PC market led the government to pursue an antitrust case over the company’s move to bundle its Internet Explorer browser with the Windows operating system. The fear was that such bundling would grant Microsoft total power over the consumer PC market forever. In reality, of course, mobile phones were out there just waiting to be perfected, and then Apple came along and did just that, and now no one really worries too much about Microsoft’s power over the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkylUm"&gt;I do wish the US government had intervened around 2016 to explore new regulations for tech giants’ mergers and acquisitions. In its absence, we could only bet on entropy — and whichever contrarian capitalists still felt like they could challenge Facebook in the market despite its many advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMutNp"&gt;The thing is, though, that a bunch of contrarian capitalists did. And lately they have been having a lot of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MIQxGM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How competition began&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kEuWJK"&gt;Facebook’s biggest competitor in 2021 is, of course, TikTok, which has been siphoning usage from Facebook’s family of apps since it launched in the United States in 2018 (after merging with Musical.ly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8tUwe"&gt;TikTok began by making it dramatically easier for people to make compelling videos, parceled out fame and fortune with a central feed that is incredibly compelling even if you don’t know or follow a single person, and eventually created an entire universe of audio memes, visual effects, and community in-jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqz68W"&gt;Eugene Wei, our best &lt;a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/9/18/seeing-like-an-algorithm"&gt;writer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat"&gt;thinker&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok, published the third part of his essay series about the app Sunday night. Among the many salient points Wei makes is that the sheer number of forces that have gone into TikTok’s success have made it difficult for Facebook (or &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/building-youtube-shorts/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;) to clone. &lt;a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2021/2/15/american-idle"&gt;He writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VoXrak"&gt;People will litigate Instagram copying Snapchat’s Stories feature until the end of time, but the fact is that format wasn’t ever going to be some defensible moat. Ephemerality is a clever new dimension on which to vary social media, but it’s easily copiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OED80Q"&gt;This is why TikTok’s network effects of creativity matter. To clone TikTok, you can’t just copy any single feature. It’s all of that, and not just the features, but how users deploy them and how the resultant videos interact with each other on the FYP feed. It’s replicating all the feedback loops that are built into TikTok’s ecosystem, all of which are interconnected. Maybe you can copy some of the atoms, but the magic lives at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wZJ7SN"&gt;The success of TikTok is a source of real anxiety inside Facebook, where employees ask CEO Mark Zuckerberg a question about it during nearly every all-hands Q&amp;amp;A session. The company has deployed a competitor, called Reels, inside of Instagram, and perhaps it will find a way to succeed. But the larger point is that, whatever the odds, Facebook now has to compete against TiKTok or risk losing the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ikJ1g"&gt;You’ve probably already considered that, though. (Unless you’re the FTC, which conspicuously avoided any mention of TikTok in its entire complaint about Facebook’s alleged monopoly position.) But when it comes to mobile short-form video, Facebook and YouTube face a real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sS3k7"&gt;So where else does Facebook suddenly find itself forced to compete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLSYhu"&gt;For starters, there’s audio. While still available only by invitation, Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90606693/basically-everyone-is-on-clubhouse-now"&gt;recently hit an estimated 10 million downloads&lt;/a&gt;. Celebrities including Tiffany Haddish, Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and Zuckerberg himself have made appearances on the app, granting it a cultural cachet rare in a social startup that is still less than a year old. Clubhouse raised money last month at a valuation of $1 billion — more than Facebook ultimately paid for Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKH8vI"&gt;Because it’s an audio app, Clubhouse doesn’t pose quite the existential threat that TikTok does: you can still theoretically browse Instagram or message businesses on WhatsApp while listening to a Clubhouse chat. But Facebook has been sufficiently intrigued by Clubhouse’s rapid rise that it is now working out how to clone the app, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html"&gt;according to a report this month in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere, Twitter already has a Clubhouse clone, &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces"&gt;called Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, in beta. It’s not clear that Clubhouse poses a threat to either company, exactly. But both are still taking it as a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10vZ21"&gt;What else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQmIJR"&gt;After years of making its most prominent investments in technically challenging media involving video, augmented reality, and virtual reality, Facebook is reportedly taking a second look at text. The rise of Substack over the past year has begun to mint a growing number of millionaire, text-based creators, while also pulling millions of people away from their social feeds into the relative calm of the email inbox. (I have a personal stake in this one, of course; I started a newsletter in large part because my social feeds had come to feel like a lousy place to get my news.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuavDA"&gt;What’s interesting here is that Facebook now seems open to this possibility, too. Last month, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; also reported that Facebook is developing newsletter tools for reporters and writers. (I’ve confirmed this with my own sources.) As with Clubhouse, newsletters hardly pose an existential threat to Facebook. But they do bleed time and attention away from the company’s apps — and in a world where news may not be even available on Facebook in some countries, it may be wise for it to have a hedge. (And Twitter clearly thinks so, too: &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html"&gt;it acquired Substack competitor Revue last month&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM2mow"&gt;That leaves Facebook competing with legitimately fast-growing, well-funded competitors across several categories. And while it’s in a much earlier stage, I think the company may soon have an interesting competitor in photography as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJbf9u"&gt;Dispo is an invite-only social photo app with a twist: you can’t see any photos you take with the app until 24 hours after you take them. (The app sends you a push notification to open them every day at 9AM local time: among other things, a nice hack to boost daily usage.) Founded by David Dobrik, one of the world’s most popular YouTubers, Dispo has been around as &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dispo-live-in-the-moment/id1491684197"&gt;a basic utility&lt;/a&gt; for a year. But last month a beta version launched on iOS with social features including shared photo “rolls,” and it quickly hit the 10,000-person cap on Apple’s TestFlight software. It &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/02/17/david-dobriks-invite-only-photo-app-dispo-generates-some-unexpected-buzz/?sh=11e64f8d7ed9"&gt;raised $4 million&lt;/a&gt; in seed funding in October, and assuming the buzz continues into a public launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dispo took off in a major way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPgkBX"&gt;Audio, video, photos, and text: to some extent, Facebook has never had to stop competing across these dimensions in the company’s history. But I can’t remember the last time it was fighting so many interesting battles &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G3bjYN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. What it means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtPR4h"&gt;Here’s what I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying when I argue that social networks are competitive again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="udO6v5"&gt;That Facebook has not acted in various anti-competitive ways throughout its history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VJN0tY"&gt;That Facebook should no longer be subject to antitrust scrutiny, or that the US government (and, separately, a coalition of US attorneys general) should abandon their lawsuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vQcg7F"&gt;That, given all this new competition, Facebook should be allowed to purchase rival social networks in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rxnYL6"&gt;That Facebook won’t remain the world’s largest social network for a long time to come, or that its business will suffer in the short term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0uVOle"&gt;In fact, I think there’s a good case to be made that antitrust pressure from the US government in particular is what has allowed competition to return to social networks in the first place. Had Clubhouse or Substack emerged in 2013 or 2014, it’s not hard to imagine Facebook racing to acquire them and knock them off the chessboard. But in 2021, when Facebook &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/media-social-media-6b03fa94c15779e770af099572f256cd"&gt;faces a formal antitrust review in the United Kingdom over its acquisition of a failing GIF search engine&lt;/a&gt;, the company can only sit back and try to copy what others are doing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbdtj2"&gt;If that’s the case, it suggests that the half-assed response to Facebook’s growing dominance over the past half-decade nonetheless got us, however belatedly, to a better place. Antitrust pressure made it extremely difficult for the company to make acquisitions, opening a window just big enough for new entrants to climb through. It remains to be seen how big any new challengers to Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter can grow. But for the first time in a long time, I’m optimistic about their chances.&lt;/p&gt;
