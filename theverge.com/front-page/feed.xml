    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tG9xHD"&gt;Apple is about to add a new feature to iPhones informing users if the device was previously repaired and whether a genuine screen or battery was used (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/ios-15-2-shows-a-service-history-of-repaired-parts-in-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;parts and service history&lt;/a&gt; section will appear (under Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; About) with the upcoming iOS 15.2 update for iPhone — providing some insight and peace of mind for buyers of used or refurbished iPhones hoping to get a proper quality OEM unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtEGWM"&gt;The new update expands on a previous feature that can tell if a screen or battery was not genuine, now adding them in one place and even including a date on when the service was performed. Since the release of the iPhone 11, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;including a warning&lt;/a&gt; when an aftermarket (ungenuine) screen was installed. Now iPhones as old as XR models can warn if a battery is ungenuine, while iPhone 12 and 13 can call out more including the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEQGbR"&gt;Earlier versions of iOS on the iPhone 13 threatened to make screen repairs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764251/iphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt;, requiring microsoldering to avoid a warning label and deactivated Face ID sensors. iOS 15.2  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786274/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes"&gt;updates the process&lt;/a&gt; to allow repairs by users or a third-party shop without a complaint from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYqxLcQmlwwcUAJm69RK6XKJJzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075322/ios15_2_repair.001.jpeg.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iOS 15.2 with new Parts and Service History section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6HOm0z"&gt;Buying and selling used iPhones is a huge market, but it can be scary not knowing if a device will have a low-quality aftermarket&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;battery that might overheat — or annoying if the screen you get has terrible colors because it’s not really OLED (when it should be). This could happen if a repair was performed by a third-party shop that is not in Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838307/apple-iphone-repairs-parts-independent-shops"&gt;independent repair program&lt;/a&gt; (IRP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EitIXY"&gt;With the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;Self Service Repair&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, customers will have a means of getting genuine parts and repairing iPhones at home. Since this method of service is supported by Apple, newer iPhones on iOS 15.2 repaired through self-service will acknowledge that a repair was done and the parts are genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeoeUB"&gt;Trading in or reselling iPhones might get more difficult, though — if aftermarket parts were used, then companies and independent buyers now have the leverage to quote lower values if a repair is reported in settings. This can lead to very &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368541/apple-trade-in-phobio-macbook-white-spots"&gt;frustrating situations&lt;/a&gt; especially if a phone needs to be sent in for inspection to confirm a trade-in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Jrql"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZGJla"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter could bring universal casting that actually works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSjLQu7b-61QZ8vRbvaiJ56pc5g=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249408/verge_IMG_8670_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This Amazon-led casting standard for TVs could challenge Apple AirPlay and Google Cast &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eU6aaf"&gt;The new smart home standard Matter is making a lot of grand promises, chief among them are fixing the interoperability mess the smart home is currently in and making Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon talk to each other. Big jobs. But it’s also tackling one of the other pain points in the connected home: TV control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm1PBy"&gt;One part of the new connectivity protocol is a specification for televisions and streaming video players. This means that Matter could become yet another way to control content in our homes. But, with its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter’s TV spec has the potential to replace proprietary casting systems, like Apple’s AirPlay or Google’s Cast, and finally free our TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2niZc"&gt;Matter TV, as we’ll call it for wont of an official name, will allow control of a television’s core functions — volume up / down, changing the channel, controlling inputs and outputs, and switching between HDMI ports. “But importantly, you can also do casting,” Chris DeCenzo, Principal Software Development Engineer at Amazon Lab126, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oENWS1"&gt;“This is an area with at least five proprietary protocols today,” he says. “The result is a complete opportunity loss for everyone.” Not to mention major headaches for users as they grapple with which voice assistant can get this content and which remote will control that streaming stick. Amazon is leading the effort to define the specification for Matter — unsurprising, as it is currently the only large player without a proprietary way to cast content from a smartphone to a TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sv-CBjF74efHYHqQaY3CTpNuA3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13262367/jbareham_180726_2773_0087.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controlling our smart TVs can feel anything but smart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1AsPEc"&gt;“Control of media is one of the most popular use cases for Alexa,” says DeCenzo, who told me Amazon is working with the different industry leaders in the fields of smart TVs, streaming video players, and content providers to help them adopt Matter. The goal is so that “customers can have a consistent way to use voice control and to launch their favorite content on those screens,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0NyUx"&gt;While the Matter TV specification doesn’t explicitly call out voice control, the idea here is standardization. One protocol for all device communication, everything will talk to everything else using the same language, no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made it. Ultimately, this means you will be able to use your control interface of choice (a voice assistant, remote control, or smartphone / tablet app) with all your streaming content devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7HxJWF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter could finally free our TVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rguZA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;When Matter arrives in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the Matter TV specification will use app-to-app communication, at least until the TVs and streaming video players become Matter enabled. The spec supports casting from a Matter client (e.g., a remote, a smart speaker, or a phone app) to an app running on a Matter-enabled TV or video player device, explains DeCenzo. It also supports URL-based casting, which means a Matter client can cast to a TV even when there’s no app for that client, if the TV supports Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH, an international standard for streaming) or HLS DRM streams (HLS is a video streaming protocol developed by Apple and widely supported across Android devices and browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tus8PG"&gt;The capability could go beyond just entertainment and be used to enable smart home notifications, says Chris LaPré of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the organization that oversees the new standard. For example, it could cast a message from your connected doorbell to your smart TV, notifying you that someone is at the door. It could potentially show you the video feed, too, something of a workaround for including video feeds in Matter, since cameras are not part of the first device rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ietivWcwo5KkGDZsTA4bL1fY9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074285/f7484de0_fd1a_11eb_8eb4_4d8ac557fa35.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CSA / Matter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matter-enabled devices will have the Matter logo on them to indicate they’re compatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="to2vl9"&gt;Intriguingly, LaPré posited that the specification could allow for the use of context when delivering these messages, such as notifying you from the smart speaker in the room you are in that your laundry is done. “It can be about casting anything, smart home notifications, local video — all it needs is a URL to pull content from,” says LaPré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hntmBy"&gt;The technology here is not system-level specific, as with Apple’s AirPlay. It appears to be more akin to Google’s Cast, where apps will need to build support for it, at least initially. But like AirPlay, and as with all Matter communications, it’s entirely local. Communication from device to device uses Matter as the channel. At launch, Matter will use ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread as its communication protocols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s30Vfu"&gt;The requirement for the app makers — such as Hulu and Netflix, who aren’t currently members of the CSA — to build Matter support could make this something of a non-starter initially. Beyond Amazon and its Prime Video and Google with YouTube, few of the major streaming content providers are part of the CSA, and the app developer will initially need to add Matter support to both the app in the phone or casting device (for example, a smart speaker, laptop, or smartphone) and the app in the receiving device (TV, streaming stick, smart display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCw2XM"&gt;“You can have communication directly from the Prime Video app on my phone to the Prime Video app that’s on the TV,” explains DeCenzo. Going forward, according to LaPré, the streaming video players and TVs will have Matter built into the devices themselves. It seems likely Amazon will enable Matter on its Fire TV devices, and the company has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;committed to upgrading all its smart speakers to support Matter&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung, TCL, Panasonic, and LG are all involved with Matter, as are Apple and Google. However, according to the list of companies on the &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;Matter website&lt;/a&gt;, Vizio, Sony, Toshiba, and Roku are a few notable hardware players that are not yet signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JleYxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a consistent way to use voice control to launch content on any screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcAKqp"&gt;The main goal, however, is part of Matter’s overarching promise: avoiding manufacturer lock-in. People should be able to buy whichever device they choose and it should be able to talk to all the other connected devices in their home, regardless of who made it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqOY9"&gt;For example, if both were Matter-enabled you should be able to control an LG TV from a Samsung smartphone, and that LG TV should be able to receive a message from a Miele smart washer that the laundry is done. But, and this is a big but, nothing in the Matter spec is a requirement. A company that is on board with Matter as a whole is under no obligation to adopt parts of the specification that they don’t need or want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEcMbI"&gt;This means that Apple and Google do not have to adopt the Matter TV specification if they don’t want to. LaPré says both companies have “blessed this” as part of the spec (Matter is governed by members of the CSA who vote on the specifications). Whether they will adopt it remains to be seen. But if Amazon does, which seems like a good bet, it should mean you can use Matter to cast from your Amazon Prime app on your iPhone to your Amazon Prime app on your Apple TV or Google Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1CPHb"&gt;I reached out to both Google and Apple about this specification and how it would impact their current offerings. Both companies have committed to supporting Matter in their respective smart home ecosystems and both are members of the CSA. Kevin Po of Google said in an email that “Google Assistant will support Matter (eg. on/off, play/pause, app launch etc.) at parity with our current Works With Assistant offering.” Apple did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5nr5N9"&gt;Po went on to reiterate that Google Cast remains Google’s preferred method for sending media via apps and voice to Chromecasts, speakers, and displays. As, we can only assume at this stage, will Airplay be Apple’s “preferred method.” But what your preferred method will be could very soon involve a lot more choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKv5qW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34SCdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block and report text spam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ep8th1m8Qtgf31rfrdgMB5cJzvE=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69520154/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Spam.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;No strategy is 100 percent effective, but you can stop much of it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xS9Cl4"&gt;Spam texts can be incredibly irritating — you get a notification and stop what you’re doing to check your phone, only to find somebody is trying to sell you something you don’t want. How can you prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz3VXk"&gt;Unfortunately, there are no absolutes in preventing text spam. But there are some ways you can at least minimize the number of spam texts that get through. Here are some strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kZBYfb"&gt;Do not answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6jYMm1"&gt;Top of the list is — as you probably already know — never reply to a spam text, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; click on a link within a spam text. If you’re not sure whether a text is spam or legitimate, hold off on replying until you’ve done a bit of research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="kVNV0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6qez8i"&gt;Use the spam filter on your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rIeftn"&gt;Android phones and iPhones have spam-filtering features that you can enable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NuvT8Q"&gt;If you have an Android phone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aZycxQ"&gt;Open the Messages app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aitn1H"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AcwIN3"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Spam protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qw3pYw"&gt;Make sure “Enable spam protection” is toggled on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LIp4DO"&gt;If you want to see what numbers you’ve marked as spam, you can go to “Spam &amp;amp; blocked” in the initial menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To set up spam blocking, go to “Settings” &amp;amp;gt; “Spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXwdP2ahVxd3OAOhvklYwpyG92s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688826/Screenshot_20210629_115526.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Spam protection. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N95yPCbJSuhETaseeQ-cGaSctgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688921/Screenshot_20210629_115223.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Enable spam protection.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bhbi4Z"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lVIqKL"&gt;Apple’s spam blocking is a little more basic than Android’s: it blocks phone numbers that you &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099"&gt;don’t have saved in your contacts list&lt;/a&gt; and haven’t been in contact with before, which could be an issue (say, if you’re expecting a call from a car service). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mT9Wfz"&gt;Open the Settings app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cON9RE"&gt;Scroll down to and select Messages &amp;gt; Unknown &amp;amp; Spam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9DWUaL"&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down to “Unknown &amp;amp;amp; Spam.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQ5MN3_pe8P_1cEcmcKEuXpe4ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688833/IMG_DE165A8C72D3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down to Unknown &amp;amp; Spam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54lBOdOA3HP0fjky5doQXJanBug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22688834/ios_spam_filter.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Filter Unknown Senders.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OAOftX"&gt;Block specific texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CPlAZi"&gt;When you get a spam text, you can block that individual number from contacting you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CHYvJs"&gt;If you have an Android phone: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iZCr"&gt;When you tap on a message that Android tags as suspicious, the OS will often give you the opportunity to report it as spam (or verify that it’s not spam). But if you get a spam text that wasn’t flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YMRXxv"&gt;Tap the three dots in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gj3lEy"&gt;Select Details &amp;gt; Block &amp;amp; report spam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNHf6y"&gt;You can just block that number if you want, or you can check “Report spam” to send the number to Google and possibly your carrier as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7myw"&gt;Note that this process can differ depending on which Android phone you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="EdU9wB"&gt;If you have an iPhone:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x3Rtt"&gt;Open the spam text and select the user icon on top of the page&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2JCJ1"&gt;If you want to report an iMessage you received as spam, then look for the “Report Junk” link under the message, tap it, tap “Delete,” and then “Report Junk.” Note that this doesn’t automatically block that phone number; you’ll have to do that separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AEFlot"&gt;Forward the text to 7726&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F8kP0O"&gt;If you’re using one of the major carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, or T-Mobile), you can report a spam text by forwarding it to 7726. (This spells “SPAM” on your phone keyboard.) This may also work with other carriers; to find out if it’s possible, check with your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHZUy1"&gt;This isn’t just a US thing, by the way. Ofcom, which regulates the UK’s communications services, &lt;a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/tackling-nuisance-calls-and-messages/spam-texts"&gt;also accepts reports of spam texts&lt;/a&gt; forwarded to 7726.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rxUjrU"&gt;Block spam using your carrier’s services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4EbKlM"&gt;Most major carriers these days offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327304/spam-calls-how-to-stop-block-robocalls-robots-scam-iphone-android"&gt;spam-blocking services for phone calls&lt;/a&gt;, and these can carry over to texts. Carrier sites will give details about free and for-pay security services offered by &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/security/security-apps/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fplans-features%2Fblock-unwanted-calls&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/call-filter/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;; if you use a different carrier, check its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AbbBTq"&gt;Use a third-party spam-blocking service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cz49nD"&gt;If you’re really frustrated and the above strategies aren’t working for you, you can try using a third-party anti-spam service. These are not free. For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.robokiller.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22555521%2Fspam-text-block-security-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboKiller&lt;/a&gt; costs $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year after a seven-day trial, while &lt;a href="https://nomorobo.com/"&gt;Nomorobo&lt;/a&gt; costs $1.99 per month per device after a 14-day trial. If you do decide you need a third-party service, you can use the trial to see if it works for you before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder makes it easier to see if you vibe with someone’s Spotify taste</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E63rjMA6pnz0LDvBELqwbAAUzC4=/0x36:1480x1023/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249195/Music_Mode.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iNAMeE"&gt;Tinder is expanding the ways you can judge a potential match by their musical tastes by introducing a Music Mode, which lets you actually hear the song someone’s set as their “Anthem” before you choose which direction to swipe. Music Mode will integrate with Spotify, like Tinder’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/20/12948514/tinder-spotify-integration-show-top-tracks-anthem"&gt;other music features&lt;/a&gt;, but should make it easier to judge someone by the song they’ve picked to represent themselves — even if you’ve never heard it before, you’ll immediately be able to tell the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiENCC"&gt;Music Mode will live in the app’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/"&gt;recently added Explore tab&lt;/a&gt;, which means you can ignore it if you don’t feel like listening to people’s jams right now. Tinder’s product VP Kyle Miller likened Music Mode to “that feeling when you’re at a party and you find out someone else loves the same songs you do.” Something I’ve heard is great but have never gotten to experience thanks to the fact that I exclusively listen to hyperpop shoegaze.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBstC9Sbnc8LtabSrK3jUxp7ZNg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073878/Music_Mode___Sizzle_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Spotify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music Mode will let you hear a potential match’s Anthem as you swipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PG5WbP"&gt;It’s nice to see Tinder finally building on its Anthem feature, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/20/12948514/tinder-spotify-integration-show-top-tracks-anthem"&gt;it introduced in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and lets you pick a song to feature on your profile and define yourself with. With that said, it’d be nice if the app also integrated with Apple Music — you &lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003358686-I-don-t-have-a-Spotify-account-Can-I-still-add-music-to-my-profile-"&gt;can choose an Anthem without linking a Spotify account&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be able to have your top artists automatically added to your profile like Spotify users can. (Us Apple Music users are already used to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcNo07Xp8aQ"&gt;dancing on our own&lt;/a&gt;, being left out of things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"&gt;like the Spotify Wrapped hype&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPak3"&gt;The dating app also released some statistics on what music people were setting as their Anthems for 2021 — topping it is Drake’s “Way 2 Sexy (with Future &amp;amp; Young Thug),” followed by Doja Cat and SZA’s “Kiss Me More” and Olivia Rodrigo’s “good 4 u.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpDw58"&gt;Personally, I feel like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5mtclwloEQ"&gt;the original “I’m Too Sexy”&lt;/a&gt; would be much more attention-grabbing than Drake’s spin on it, but you do you. Hopefully, though, Tinder will be able to do some sort of sorting for Music Mode so you don’t end up hearing the same song over and over if everyone is using it as their Anthem. The company says Music Mode should become available everywhere you can get Spotify in the coming weeks, and that you’ll be able to use it if you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003357846-Connecting-Spotify-to-your-Tinder-profile"&gt;linked your Spotify account&lt;/a&gt; and added an Anthem of your own. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kobo’s Elipsa and Sage e-readers are better for reading than writing</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t throw out your pen and paper yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="KrjVVj"&gt;E Ink displays, with their ultra crisp resolutions and black and white limitations, have been a natural fit for replacing pen and paper for years. It’s no wonder that the most common uses of the display technology in consumer technology has been for e-readers and digital paper, attempts to try to slash through paper’s thousand-year hegemony as a dominant technology for writing down information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDD8Qw"&gt;This year, Kobo took the logical step and combined the two with the massive, document-sized 10.3-inch $399.99 Elipsa and its new flagship $259.99 Sage e-reader. On paper, it’s a great idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i20VPO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10909837"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pfY03t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10909844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G48l20"&gt;Kobo is by no means the first major company to offer an E Ink-based writing device: Sony has produced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/10/15242238/sony-dpt-rp1-giant-digital-paper-tablet-notebook"&gt;digital paper tablets for years&lt;/a&gt;, and reMarkable is already on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21403489/remarkable-2-e-ink-paper-tablet-review"&gt;second-generation writing-focused device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwP3bE"&gt;But both Sony and reMarkable’s tablets, which theoretically supporting ebooks, lacked the storefronts and existing customer buy-in to really succeed as a viable e-reader, where the only way to get books was to sideload whatever DRM-free ebooks you already had. The two new Kobo tablets, on the other hand, propose the best of both worlds, combining Kobo’s robust book storefront and library lending support with the paper-ending prowess of an E Ink stylus system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvgW7O"&gt;Neither device quite hits the balance, though. The smaller Sage is better to read with, with physical turn buttons, waterproofing (although the stylus is not), and adjustable color temperature for more natural lighting. But the eight-inch display is awkwardly sized, leaving the device too big to fit into any pants pocket (although it does fit into a jacket pocket), while at the same time being a bit too cramped to comfortably write on, especially if you’re looking at a full, letter-sized document. And unlike the Elipsa, it doesn’t include a stylus in its $259.99 price, instead charging an extra $40 for the privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fTQI18GIjZv9gJkIgSVlVDkWCgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070752/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kobo Sage excels as an e-reader, although the display is a bit cramped for writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zfhpdq"&gt;The Elipsa suffers from the opposite problem: its bigger display lends itself more naturally to using it as a digital paper tablet for annotating PDFs and scribbling notes in a notepad, but it’s more awkward to read on due to the unwieldy size. It’s a great option for things like digital textbooks, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlM2Vy"&gt;Unlike its smaller cousin, the Elipsa isn’t waterproof, and the display eschews the adjustable color temperature feature on the Sage, too. (I’d also beg Kobo to rethink the placement of the power button on a future model — the current location, on the “right” side of the tablet, makes it all but impossible to use when holding it in your right hand.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvO7H2"&gt;In short, the better the device is for reading books, the worse it becomes for using as an E Ink notebook and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJPbJsULoETebi-8pAA8T9kKBzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070751/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The larger Elipsa is well suited for sketching.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3DGTUr"&gt;And while Kobo’s handle on e-reader software and technology is competitive, the digital paper aspects of its hardware feel distinctly first generation on both devices. Kobo’s choice to include an extra screen layer for its backlight means that the writing isn’t quite as responsive or tactile feeling as the reMarkable 2. Nor does Kobo have the textured, almost scratchy tactile surface that made the reMarkable so nice to write on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLD5BX"&gt;The software also has some odd quirks, too. One of the more interesting capabilities of Kobo’s devices is the fact that you can write on books — annotating, underlining, highlighting, and otherwise scribbling over or around whatever you’re reading. If you’re the kind of person who likes being able to do that sort of thing, it’s a useful feature once you’ve already got the stylus support (and unlike drawing on a paper book, it’s easily erased). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xQR1a"&gt;Oddly, there’s no easy way to toggle annotations on and off, short of changing the margins or font size. Since annotations are tied to a specific page layout, changing display settings makes your scribbles disappear, replaced by an icon in the margins that makes it easy to revert back to the original (annotated) settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHrQNsqTK4cz1DFRhUxIFcu9J9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070754/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kobo Stylus is included with the Elipsa but sold as a $40 add-on for the Sage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pK66IDgkSZlZPntvFIr3D3lWajM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070756/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both e-readers have landscape support, but it’s awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmrTvR"&gt;There are also some awkward limitations: while you can scribble on Kobo-purchased books to your heart’s content, you can’t share those annotated books or pages. DRMed PDFs can’t be annotated at all, which might limit your ability to take notes on digital textbooks, and library books borrowed from Overdrive will lose their notes once you return them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="he6jxr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kobo’s software oddities linger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WrxzAi"&gt;Kobo’s software oddities linger throughout the device. Both devices, for instance, support landscape layouts for ebooks but not on any of the menus. And the software is badly in need of a smartphone-style control tray for adjusting brightness and basic settings: right now, in the notebook mode, the only way to control brightness is through a poorly advertised swiping gesture, rather than through any software menu. And the Sage doesn’t even offer an option to get to your notebooks from its homescreen, hiding the feature away in a secondary menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMZuux"&gt;The company is also still largely resting on its laurels when it comes to things like Pocket and Overdrive integration, which, while better than Amazon’s non-implementation of the two features, still could be a lot more user-friendly than they are. Kobo, presumably, is just fine with customers buying books from its store rather than taking them out from their local libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdfGuaaCC8pVTpNmsMXs7rHA7XA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070753/cgartenberg_211207_4916_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sage’s display can adjust its color temperature; the Elipsa cannot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="INiODr"&gt;The key thing to understand about Kobo’s two new tablets, though, is what you’re getting into before you buy. The Sage, despite having stylus support, is still an e-reader first; and while the digital paper features are a nice bonus, I wouldn’t buy one to use as a digital notebook. And while the Elipsa is an interesting digital paper device made better by Kobo’s ebook infrastructure, it’s still a first-generation piece of hardware that’s outclassed as a writing tablet by the reMarkable 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vVesbn"&gt;Still, even if neither of the two devices hits the sweet spot of a perfect paper replacement, the fact that Kobo is looking to expand its feature set outside of simply buying ebooks is an encouraging one. Hopefully, it will continue to help push the industry forward into taking full advantage of the unique displays that devices like the Kobo Sage and Elipsa offer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU proposals could give millions of gig workers employment rights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Wcrbbi8XUQoWtjv_DfiGsdoq9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249043/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WnCQnU"&gt;The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has put forward a series of proposals that could lead to millions of gig workers across the bloc getting similar legal protections to traditional employees. In a &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6605"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Commission says these rights would include a minimum wage (where applicable), collective bargaining, paid leave, unemployment and sickness benefits, and pensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMyAGO"&gt;The Commission says an estimated 28 million people in the EU currently work through “digital labor platforms,” and of these, as many as 5.5 million may be incorrectly classified as being self-employed. So, with its new rules, the EU wants to lay out a series of criteria that will clearly determine whether a platform is a simple intermediary or an “employer” with more obligations to its “workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8AZM8Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Uber are expected to lobby against the rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2PRq8s"&gt;The legal status of gig workers has become an increasingly contentious issue around the world. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/technology/gig-workers-europe-uber.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that taxi companies like Uber and food delivery services like Deliveroo have been accused of categorizing their workers as independent contractors to save costs and reduce legal liabilities. If adopted, the EU’s new gig economy rules could be some of the strictest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBhSm7"&gt;Individual countries have already attempted to push back on these categorizations. A legal ruling in the UK in February stated that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/21330906/uber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights"&gt;Uber’s drivers are workers&lt;/a&gt;, and the following month the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;company started offering a minimum wage and paid vacation&lt;/a&gt;. Uber opposes the Commission’s new proposal, telling the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll result in higher costs for customers, putting jobs at risk. (Though, for what it’s worth, the company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-fares-double-small-cities-if-voters-reject-prop-22-2020-10#:~:text=%22The%20vast%20majority%20of%20our,on%20what%20city%20you%20are.%22"&gt;made the same argument when California&lt;/a&gt; was debating the issue of worker protections. When the company got its way, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike"&gt;raised prices anyway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDys6M"&gt;Alongside its new proposals around employment status, the Commission also wants to increase transparency around the management of employees via algorithm, including the right for workers to contest automated decisions. The proposals also include new obligations for platforms to provide data to national authorities, as well as guidelines clarifying the rights of self-employed people to collective bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sH6xjx"&gt;“Our proposal for a Directive will help false self-employed working for platforms to correctly determine their employment status and enjoy all the social rights that come with that,” the EU’s Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said. “Genuine self-employed on platforms will be protected through enhanced legal certainty on their status and there will be new safeguards against the pitfalls of algorithmic management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPNgug"&gt;The Commission’s proposals will now be debated by the European Parliament and Council. The directive would then need to be adopted into law by individual member states. Given the timescales involved in both these processes, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that the rules are unlikely to become law before 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Winning the war on ransomware</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The DOJ’s task force is changing the landscape around hackers, but will it be enough?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7G6qma"&gt;In the past 10 years, ransomware has become inescapable. All kinds of institutions have been targeted, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667637/go-read-this-ransomware-attacks-schools-student-identity-theft"&gt;schools children go to&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776561/hosptial-cyberattack-ransomware-risk"&gt;medical infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;report from the US Treasury estimates&lt;/a&gt; there were over half a billion dollars in ransomware payouts in the first half of 2021 alone. Law enforcement has struggled to get a handle on the situation, with many groups operating for years with no apparent fear of repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99EgLA"&gt;This year, federal law enforcement decided to try something new. In April, the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ransomware-targeted-by-new-justice-department-task-force-11619014158"&gt;created the Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force&lt;/a&gt; in a move to prioritize the “disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and digital extortion activity.” The task force is supposed to help share information between DOJ departments, as well as work with outside and foreign agencies. In the months since, it’s made some impressive prosecutions, but they’re just a sliver of the overall  — and the bigger picture remains maddeningly unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="G0OW9I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ttj2fT"&gt;One of the first publicized wins for the group came in June, when the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization"&gt;Department of Justice said&lt;/a&gt; the group was handling the case of an individual alleged to be partially responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/trickbot-not-your-average-hat-trick-a-malware-with-multiple-hats/"&gt;the malware suite known as Trickbot&lt;/a&gt;, which could help expose a system to a ransomware attack. Days after that announcement came an even bigger win: &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside"&gt;the DOJ announced&lt;/a&gt; it had seized back $2.3 million of the $4.4 million ransom paid by oil company Colonial Pipeline, and that the task force had coordinated the efforts. Then, in October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770701/revil-ransomware-arrest-kaseya-crypto-europol-cybersecurity"&gt;its biggest win yet&lt;/a&gt; — the arrests of a few alleged members of REvil, a hacking group, by European police forces, and the seizure of over $6 million in funds the department says were linked to ransomware payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQkPo7"&gt;Still, the sheer volume of attacks means a handful of prosecutions is unlikely to make a difference. Prosecutors need the threat of law enforcement action to scare criminals away from ransomware — and some experts say the scheme is still too lucrative for criminals to give up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BREgzz"&gt;Hackers “prefer to take the risk instead of leaving this lucrative malicious activity behind,” according to Dmitry Bestuzhev, a researcher at cybersecurity company Kaspersky. “So what they try to do is to learn from others’ mistakes and improve their opsec, but there is no evidence they feel intimidated and want to quit.” Bestuzhev says they’ll continue to re-form groups, even as the government works to shut them down — “even with the successful arrest we have recently witnessed, many ransomware groups are just here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKEDHx"&gt;But not everyone agrees with Bestuzhev. John Fokker, the head of cyber investigations for McAfee Enterprise Advanced Threat Research, is more optimistic that the task force is starting to change the outlook for criminals. For years ransomware “had been relatively untouched,” not getting too much attention from governments, Fokker told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Now that the task force was starting to crack down, he says, “what used to be a safe space isn’t a safe space anymore. There’s beginning to be an atmosphere of distrust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="kBBYxO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s beginning to be an atmosphere of distrust”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgNZD9"&gt;The attention from the task force has also been affecting ransomware groups’ ability to advertise to potential customers, the ones who often use their malware to infect targets. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com%2Fblogs%2Fenterprise%2Fmcafee-enterprise-atr%2Fwho-will-bend-the-knee-in-raas-game-of-thrones-in-2022%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22822884%2Fus-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a blog&lt;/a&gt;, Fokker discussed how cybercrime forums have become hesitant to play host to ransomware operators, banning them from advertising in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline attacks. Forum administrators, when they offered an explanation for the decision, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/three-major-hacking-forums-ban-ransomware-ads-as-some-ransomware-gangs-shut-down/"&gt;said that ransomware was attracting a lot of unwanted attention&lt;/a&gt; — as one admin put it, according to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;, the word “ransom” was now associated with “unpleasant phenomena — geopolitics, extortion, government hacking.” Another forum had a cheekier explanation for why it was banning posts about ransomware: “if it ran somewhere, then you should probably go catch it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRg7Jy"&gt;The ability to advertise on forums cut off the groups’ easy access to customers, made it harder for ransomware creators to get in touch with the affiliates making them billions of dollars, and made the contact that does happen riskier on both sides. Transferring money or giving demos becomes harder when there’s not a (somewhat) trusted third-party platform to help mediate. That, along with bounties for up to $10 million, has started to create “little cracks in the model,” says Fokker. He even mentioned an instance where an affiliate, angry with what they considered to be a meager payout, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/angry-conti-ransomware-affiliate-leaks-gangs-attack-playbook/"&gt;posted a ransomware group’s entire playbook&lt;/a&gt;. “That kind of environment hurts business,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hFl5IC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re taking the fight to the bad guys”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDWaWh"&gt;The task force has also been helping the people on the other side of ransomware: the companies and organizations that are targeted by it. Government agencies have been working together to keep industries informed about what actions they’ve taken against ransomware operators, and to issue guidance to help keep companies safe. ”The Department of Commerce, Department of Treasury, State, Homeland Security, and Defense, all of them have taken a very clear, concrete action on ransomware actors to disrupt and each of them have their own press release and their own guidance,” says Vishaal Hariprasad, CEO of cyber-focused insurance company Resilience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiU4DH"&gt;When asked to grade the government’s actions, he says, “I would actually give the government an A for what they’ve done in the past 90 days. I think it’s been pretty incredible to see that we’re actually taking action, we’re taking the fight to the bad guys with disruption, with arrests, with warrants, sanctions, the $10 million bounty for any information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6hY3p"&gt;Hariprasad says while the government had carried out similar actions in years prior, the publicity was a boon to victims. “I think the task force has helped coordinate it, but coordinating in the back end where nobody can see isn’t valuable. It doesn’t have the motivating psychological impact unless you can talk about it ... the government’s always been doing things, it’s just never been able to publicly talk about it in a clear and concise, coordinated way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dDdpeB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A big part of deterrence is making sure they understand that there are repercussions to their actions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I40BhI"&gt;Still others are optimistic that the task force can have an impact if it keeps up its legal actions. “As long as there is a sustained effort against these somewhat decentralized and shifting crime gangs; this isn’t just ‘whack-a-mole,’” says Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky, echoing Fokker’s optimism. “While we are seeing the resurrection of certain parts of the ransomware-as-a-service chain in response,” Baumgartner thinks the “coordinated anti-ransomware efforts are just the start. It is great to see evidence of some ransom payments clawed back, decryption keys obtained, communications infiltrated, successful multi-national law enforcement efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXie3u"&gt;In particular, Hariprasad thinks massively disruptive attacks could become less frequent. “I think you’ll still have the one or two major coordinated campaigns that will be very sophisticated,” he says. “But as they get a lot of attention and people start focusing on them, you’ll see that happen less, and the younger or the less sophisticated operators will continue to get back to the lower end of the ransoms and just kind of go for quantity over quality.” Better to collect a few $50,000 ransoms without making headlines, the thinking goes, than to bag $40 million and have law enforcement kicking down your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLFKry"&gt;It’s hard to say which of the task force’s tactics will end up having the greatest effect, and there’s always the possibility that things get worse before they get better. If ransomware operators wind up desperate, they could end up going after a massive target, in a Hollywood-style “one last job” scenario. Ransomware could also become a more manageable annoyance, as hackers look for the next big cash cow, one that the world’s governments aren’t paying as much attention to. Or attackers could get creative and start developing entirely new ways to make trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BDPV0d"&gt;Cybersecurity is always a cat-and-mouse game, and the incentives to hack big companies won’t be going away — but as Hariprasad told me, “a big part of deterrence is making sure they understand that there are repercussions to their actions and that the government is actively doing something.” On that point, at least, governments seem to be making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes was always in control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nh50hlgygpiFOkywqW0dX0l-LSU=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248958/VRG_ILLO_4914_Holmes_Trial.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Joseph Gough&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;All the queen’s men&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="C898gH"&gt;Control and image are important to Elizabeth Holmes. They were important to the PR effort around Theranos when she was portrayed as the second coming of Steve Jobs. They were important when she delegated reprimands to maintain her friendly image. And they are important now — as a jury is about to decide whether she’s guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFHG3a"&gt;Since September, she’s walked to the courthouse holding hands with someone — usually her mother. I have watched Holmes sit bolt upright at the defense table as her lawyers slowly wilt. She’s dressed in business attire — sheath dresses with structured blazers or skirt suits. Sensible kitten heels. A coterie of expensive blondes and men in fancy loafers have &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/elizabeth-holmes-relies-on-entourage-of-friends-as-theranos-trial-nears-end.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.PostToTwitter"&gt;filled her side of the courtroom&lt;/a&gt;, especially as she has testified. (Occasionally, there is even a brunette.) Holmes is presenting an image of herself as a former CEO, surrounded by friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNnN0B"&gt;Holmes testified for seven days, and then the defense rested its case. (Closing arguments will take place next week.) She was one of only three witnesses her lawyers called to rebut the prosecution’s case — and by far the most significant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ec4dI1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The trial showcased her employees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vjWYNe"&gt;The government called 29 witnesses in an attempt to show Holmes knowingly deceived investors and patients. The prosecution’s case showcased her employees, many of whom had quit because they were uncomfortable with what Theranos was doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="se8RjT"&gt;Perhaps because the defense kept him on the stand so long, when I think of the archetypal Theranos employee, I think of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;Adam Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt;, the former lab director. He started at Theranos excited about what it was trying to accomplish and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22705156/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-aging-the-case-rosendorff"&gt;left miserable&lt;/a&gt;. Rosendorff &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; Theranos VP Daniel Young — when he said Young’s name, his voice dripped with scorn. He was openly contemptuous of former Theranos president Sunny Balwani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3oQMV"&gt;Rosendorff didn’t sound like he hated Elizabeth Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfsHU7"&gt;During his testimony, he was shown an email wherein Holmes’ brother, Christian, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699614/elizabeth-holmes-trial-steve-jobs-emails"&gt;scolded Rosendorff for refusing to defend a bad test result&lt;/a&gt;. Then, as we all in the courtroom watched, Rosendorff was shown Christian had forwarded the email to his sister. &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%204323/Trial%20Exh.%204323%20Email.pdf"&gt;In reply to Christian&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes wrote, “You handled this excellently.” When Rosendorff read this in court, apparently seeing it for the first time, his face fell. The email hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qktpz"&gt;Something similar happened with Tyler Shultz, another Theranos whistleblower. When Shultz took his concerns about Theranos’ methods to Holmes, Balwani’s response was &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%201675/Trial%20Exh.%201675%20Email.pdf"&gt;nasty&lt;/a&gt;. In the email, Balwani complained about Shultz’s “arrogant and patronizing tone and reckless comments” before proceeding to insult his understanding of statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnjBj3"&gt;But Balwani wasn’t acting alone. He’d drafted the email before he sent it and shared it with Holmes, &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205645/Trial%20Exh.%205645%20Email.pdf"&gt;who made edits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FpKlAA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Her manners have been impeccable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5F5KB"&gt;Holmes clearly wanted to be liked, so at Theranos, she let others handle rebukes. This is not unusual. Jimmy Page ran Led Zeppelin, make no mistake — but he didn’t do the yelling to keep people in line. He had &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/11/26/led-zeppelin-peter-grant-manager"&gt;Peter Grant, Zeppelin’s manager&lt;/a&gt;, do that. (Kurt Cobain &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Come_as_You_are/ZEI_X-bDWQwC?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;bsq=%22people%20who%20are%20quiet%20are%20not%20necessarily%20passive%22"&gt;sometimes deployed Courtney Love&lt;/a&gt; in a similar fashion.) A lot of hierarchical organizations are run this way, including corporations and monarchies, allowing the leader to maintain a pristine image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3Vqnn"&gt;Holmes has sought to carry such an image — six years after the first &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; article exposed the reality at Theranos — into the courtroom. Throughout her time on the stand, Holmes focused primarily on whatever lawyer was talking to her. She listened attentively. When she fumbled with an exhibit or was confused, she apologized, smiling. In the small interactions I had with her outside the courtroom — there is only one women’s room — her manners have been impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="W1oAkh"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rWt7ha"&gt;Central to the trial is the question of how much Holmes knew. For her to be guilty of fraud, she had to have the intent to deceive. Intent is difficult to prove. Holmes’ defense argued in its opening statements the picture is more complicated than what the prosecution has put forward. The defense has suggested that most of the blame should fall on the shoulders of Theranos’ lab directors and on Balwani. That Holmes didn’t know about the problems in-depth. She thought she was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bd1RJc"&gt;To emphasize this, the defense had Holmes testify to how what the investors heard was &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; true — so maybe the investors had just misunderstood. “I wanted to convey the impact the company could make for people and for healthcare,” Holmes said. “I talked about what we created and what it could do, what was possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytlVjR"&gt;Theranos worked with pharma companies, even if drugmakers such as Pfizer and Schering-Plough didn’t independently validate Theranos’ tech, as investors said Holmes claimed. Holmes said she put the drug companies’ logos on documents she gave to investors and business partners to represent the partnership — not to fool anyone. She couldn’t, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22811246/elizabeth-holmes-texts-control-theranos-money"&gt;explain away other changes&lt;/a&gt; she made to those documents that presented Theranos in a better light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQFn2W"&gt;Theranos did one study with a US Army burn unit. It had started paperwork for other military studies — but didn’t deploy in Iraq, Afghanistan, or on military helicopters. But investors said Holmes told them that the company’s devices &lt;em&gt;were &lt;/em&gt;used in Afghanistan and on medevacs. “I don’t think I said that,” Holmes said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823361/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial-cross-examination"&gt;during her cross-examination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKqW2Z"&gt;Holmes claimed she didn’t tell Theranos investors about the company’s modifications to commercially available machines because she wanted to protect trade secrets. But she could have told Walgreens, because it was a business partner that had a confidentiality agreement in place, the prosecution pointed out, &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%2015055/Trial%20Exh.%2015055%20Email.pdf"&gt;citing a document&lt;/a&gt; her own lawyers had created about trade secrets at Theranos. Certainly Holmes could have chosen to correct the glowing &lt;em&gt;Fortune &lt;/em&gt;article that said Theranos only used its own devices. She did not. Instead, Theranos’ investor relations team sent it to her investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="HnXsWV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes is testifying because it is the only way she can assert control over the trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqk0og"&gt;Two claims stuck out as being in the realm of pure fantasy: the number of tests Theranos could perform on its own equipment and its financial projections. To counter those, the defense showed evidence that Theranos was &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; on a device that &lt;em&gt;might have been&lt;/em&gt; capable of running all the tests Theranos wanted to run at some point in the future. It also tried to pin the financial projections squarely on Balwani alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Zknkj"&gt;The court heard remarkably consistent testimony from multiple investors. The jury heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;audio recordings&lt;/a&gt; of Holmes &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/GSUG1tVJYnf6A45BwOVI"&gt;lying confidently&lt;/a&gt;. Jurors also saw video evidence — most recently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGfaJZAdfNE"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Mad Money&lt;/em&gt; segment&lt;/a&gt; — of Holmes’ dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMJXkY"&gt;To make sure those recordings weren’t the only way the jury heard her voice, Holmes testified in her own defense. I have seen speculation that she did this because she is a master persuader. I don’t think that’s quite right — not least because Holmes wasn’t persuasive when she was unrehearsed. Holmes testified because it was the only way she could assert control over the trial, just as she made a point of controlling prospective investors’ &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%202065/Trial%20Exh.%202065%20Email.pdf"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823361/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial-cross-examination"&gt;s of Theranos tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZHeMF"&gt;In her direct testimony, I saw only a glimmer of the charmer I’d been promised. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22792606/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-witness-stand-surprise"&gt;first day she was on the stand&lt;/a&gt;, I thought we’d get a &lt;em&gt;tour de force&lt;/em&gt;. She was smiling, confident, relaxed. The early days of Theranos were happy memories for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DyE3Ka"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The net effect was of watching someone realize in real time exactly how strong the case against her was &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocsq9a"&gt;When she was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799756/elizabeth-holmes-pfizer-logo-confession"&gt;asked about the testimony she’d heard in the trial&lt;/a&gt;, she seemed to get increasingly nervous — and her strategy of blaming others for Theranos’ problems didn’t feel especially compelling. The net effect was of watching someone realize in real time exactly how strong the case against her was and how weak her explanation sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgCvR2"&gt;Frequently, when she was cross-examined, Holmes told the court &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823361/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial-cross-examination"&gt;she didn’t recall&lt;/a&gt; a conversation, text, or email. Sometimes this sounded flimsy — but sometimes it sounded like a natural response to being asked questions about events and conversations that took place more than five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuuoSl"&gt;On the final day of her direct testimony, Holmes pivoted from distancing herself from Theranos’ operations. She said that she’d been raped at Stanford, and it was part of why she’d dropped out. Her face turned pink; she almost sobbed. This was the beginning of Holmes trying to change the narrative that the prosecution had presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj0GzB"&gt;The Stanford incident wasn’t part of Theranos’ official founding lore. She wasn’t just starting a company — she couldn’t stand to be at Stanford anymore. “I decided I was going to build a life by building this company,” she said. Building a new company also meant building a new identity: a founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="d6rIJz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You are the company,” Balwani texted Holmes in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTh9So"&gt;That made a few other things click into place. &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205704/Trial%20Exh.%205704%20Email.pdf"&gt;Emailing Rupert Murdoch,&lt;/a&gt; the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal,&lt;/em&gt; to try to kill John Carreyrou’s story wasn’t &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;extreme. But hiring private investigators and Fusion GPS to harass Carreyrou and his sources was unusual. Once she admitted the company was about building a new identity, it made more sense. (“You are the company,” &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387G/Trial%20Exh.%205387G%20Text.pdf"&gt;Balwani texted Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.) It wasn’t just that Carreyrou was exposing Theranos — he was ripping away part of her very self&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZZ7ta"&gt;In one exchange, prosecutors made this connection explicit. According to a set of notes Holmes said she took while Balwani raged at her, he said, “I don’t enjoy being in a company that’s not going to win... fucking mediocre quality of this piece of shit company.” Prosecutor Robert Leach asked Holmes if that was Balwani telling her about the problems with the company. Holmes replied, “He’s telling me about problems with me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfWSUR"&gt;Her performance on the stand when she talked about Balwani was compelling. Certainly the jurors were rapt. Holmes also had some contemporaneous documents to support her allegations: a &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207734/Trial%20Exh.%207734%20Notes.pdf"&gt;handwritten memo by Balwani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207534/Trial%20Exh.%207534%20Notes.pdf"&gt;her notes as he talked&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387F/Trial%20Exh.%205387F%20Text%20Messages.pdf"&gt;some text messages&lt;/a&gt;, including one where Balwani said, “I have molded you,” and chastised her for speaking in her “giddy” voice. She also testified that Balwani didn’t tell her to lie to investors, business partners, or the press. Instead, she said, “He impacted everything about who I was, and I don’t fully understand that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAoOEL"&gt;The prosecution responded by presenting texts where Balwani deferred to her or where Holmes overruled him. In &lt;a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387B/Trial%20Exh.%205387B%20Texts.pdf"&gt;a message from April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Balwani wrote to Holmes, “I am worried about overexposure without solid substance.” Holmes replied, “That media is why we are getting Americare,” an insurance company. (Presumably, there was some kind of deal, but more details weren’t offered in court.) She went on to suggest using the media to “drown out and refute the crap.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="vwtdOn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It is hard to say what happened in Balwani and Holmes’ private relationship, not least because it was secret&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3m64Mg"&gt;In July 2015, Balwani again objected to Holmes’ PR strategy, something he’d deferred to her on: “I do dislike the direction u have taken with all this PR and all legal work.” He even offered to leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5smgj"&gt;And after seeing Holmes speak at a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/elizabeth-holmes-discusses-theranos-at-wsjdlive-2015/20CE68A0-CAEE-48E0-BAB4-FD6C47D283BE.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, Balwani wrote, “Worried about your ‘all fingersticks on our technology’ comment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mS5TU1"&gt;It is hard to say what happened in Balwani and Holmes’ private relationship, not least because it was secret. But the texts where Balwani protested Holmes’ strategies show that he didn’t call &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the shots at Theranos. In some of the documents we saw, when Balwani laid into someone, it was because Holmes had encouraged it. In the business relationship, she appeared to be the dominant partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwjfeq"&gt;The evidence also pointed to Holmes’ need for control. Press strategies are about control — Holmes even dictated &lt;em&gt;Fortune &lt;/em&gt;journalist &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;Roger Parloff’s word choice&lt;/a&gt;. The defense has noted multiple times that Holmes never sold a share of her Theranos stock; she also lost everything she’d invested. The defense pointed to this as proof she believed in Theranos’ tech. Well, maybe. But she was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/8W5FAVfMOfNalo3tYR10"&gt;also making a salary of $400,000 a year in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. What would she need to sell her stock for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4uovh"&gt;Founding a company, being its CEO, and owning the majority of its stock (with super-voting rights, no less) put her in total control. She could have, as she admitted on cross-examination, fired the entire board of directors if she wanted. Her testimony about abuse was aimed at obscuring that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZAyo0"&gt;Domestic abuse can warp a person’s self-image. But this isn’t a domestic abuse trial, and we have only tiny glimpses of what went on in Holmes’ and Balwani’s relationship. The jury may also be instructed to disregard it. Once the defense had rested, prosecutors told Judge Edward Davila to expect a filing to strike Holmes’ abuse testimony from the record. (The gist: without an expert witness to put that testimony in context, it is irrelevant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEWKOF"&gt;Even if they are told not to consider it, the jury still &lt;em&gt;heard &lt;/em&gt;those allegations. But the image Holmes presented of herself in that testimony — thoroughly under Balwani’s control, down to the last details of what she ate and who she saw  — ran counter to the image she projected, down to her posture: &lt;em&gt;immaculate&lt;/em&gt; self-control, a leader. That image is a lot closer to the person we saw calling the shots in their texts and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;sending subordinates emails at 1AM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5gXCgc"&gt;The question is whether the jury will notice that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft tempts software pirates with 50 percent discount on Office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIwpP_9lPmcvzKD3edaeIw9xQ9Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248712/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31Wchq"&gt;In a bold bid to turn digital crooks away from a life of crime, Microsoft is offering a 50 percent discount on its Office suite to some people using pirated versions. &lt;a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2021/12/03/pirated-versions-of-office-are-getting-a-discount-offer-for-a-microsoft-365-subscription/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghacks &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that a new message in the Office ribbon bar is appearing on pirated Office apps, tempting people with a 50 percent discount on a genuine Microsoft 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHxaWg"&gt;The message links to an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fbuy%2Fget-genuine-b%3Focid%3Dprod_unlicensed_cons_fuel_acq_getgenuine50_buy%26rtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official Microsoft website&lt;/a&gt; that claims “pirated software exposes your PC to security threats.” Microsoft warns Office pirates that they run the risk of running into viruses, malware, data loss, identify theft, and the inability to receive critical updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uw3INNGnDbIpxTMYywVAmk0sxrc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23075428/officepiratednotification.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ghacks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 50 percent discount notification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m33Z85"&gt;The discount brings the price of a Microsoft 365 Family subscription down to just $49.99 for the first year, or $34.99 for a year of Microsoft 365 Personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoBoMn"&gt;Microsoft has used “get genuine Office” banners in its productivity suite for years, but it’s rare to see the software maker offer big discounts to convert pirates into paid customers. There doesn’t appear to be a discount for the perpetual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704168/microsoft-office-2021-features-pricing-release-date"&gt;$149.99 Office 2021 version&lt;/a&gt;, either. Like the rest of us, pirates are being persuaded to move to Office subscriptions instead, as Microsoft seeks to boost its subscriber numbers way beyond 50 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp launches cryptocurrency payments pilot in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMeRn7jtTHoSnUs2kV9iQEvnHN8=/0x0:1683x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70248672/FGHzidMVcAEqPAY.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bX9D7N"&gt;WhatsApp has launched a new pilot that lets a “limited number” of people in the US send and receive money from within a chat using cryptocurrency. The feature is powered by Novi, Meta’s digital wallet that launched as a pilot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734487/facebook-novi-digital-wallet-pilot-program-payments-diem-cryptocurrency"&gt;six weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, with payments made using &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/paxos-renames-its-stablecoin-from-pax-to-usdp/#:~:text=Paxos%20Standard%20is%20now%20Pax,remains%20fundamentally%20identical%20to%20PAX.&amp;amp;text=Sending%20money%20is%20as%20easy,from%20one%20wallet%20to%20another."&gt;Pax Dollars (USDP)&lt;/a&gt;, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar issued by Paxos. The news was announced by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/skasriel/status/1468722859648307201"&gt;Novi’s incoming head Stephane Kasriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1468724981886427138"&gt;WhatsApp’s Will Cathcart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzA14T"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.novi.com/WhatsApp"&gt;Novi’s website&lt;/a&gt;, sending a payment works much like sending any other attachment in WhatsApp. You access the feature via the paper clip icon on Android or the + icon on iOS, and then select “Payment” from the menu that appears. Novi’s site notes there are no fees for sending or receiving money, no limits on how often payments can be sent, and no fees to keep a balance in your Novi account or to withdraw it to your bank account. Payments are transferred instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w20vbf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There's a new way to try the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/novi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Novi&lt;/a&gt; digital wallet. Starting today, a limited number of people in the US will be able to send and receive money using Novi on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, making sending money to family and friends as easy as sending a message.    &lt;a href="https://t.co/dGz3lejri7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dGz3lejri7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stephane Kasriel (@skasriel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/skasriel/status/1468722859648307201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZU3Qh"&gt;The Novi pilot was originally available in the US and Guatemala, but &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-announcing-the-novi-pilot-program-in-the-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that users in Guatemala won’t be able to access the new WhatsApp payments functionality. Instead, they’ll have to continue using the standalone Novi app. Payments do not affect WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption, which is in place by default for all personal conversations. The WhatsApp Novi pilot is available in both English and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLL5UQ"&gt;The new pilot has its roots in Facebook’s (now Meta’s) much-hyped cryptocurrency plans, which were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18716326/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-blockchain-irs-starbucks"&gt;officially announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Facebook (as part of the Libra Association) planned to develop and launch a cryptocurrency called Libra, which would be pegged to a basket of low-volatility assets rather than any one specific currency. This would integrate with a Facebook-developed digital wallet called Calibra. The whole system was designed to offer a way to send money around the world with lower fees than traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWVENu"&gt;These plans have shifted considerably since then. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755078/libra-diem-name-change-cryptocurrency-facebook"&gt;Libra has become Diem&lt;/a&gt;, the Libra Association has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910330/mastercard-stripe-ebay-facebook-libra-association-withdrawal-cryptocurrency"&gt;lost several of its most high profile members&lt;/a&gt; and become the Diem Association, and Calibra has become Novi. Perhaps most notably, Novi has ended up launching without the Diem cryptocurrency. Instead, Pax Dollars are the work of a separate company &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_Trust_Company"&gt;called Paxos&lt;/a&gt;, and Meta is relying on cryptocurrency exchange &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-power-crypto-custody-for-facebooks-novi-90dc8d3f5830"&gt;Coinbase as its custody partner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtSlFm"&gt;Meta’s then head of Novi David Marcus said that the company is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447443250728962"&gt;still committed to Diem&lt;/a&gt; when he announced the launch of the Novi pilot in October. “We intend to launch Novi with Diem once it receives regulatory approval,” Marcus tweeted. David Marcus subsequently said he was leaving the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810220/facebook-crypto-david-marcus-novi-diem-meta"&gt;at the end of the year&lt;/a&gt;. He has called the pilot of Novi in WhatsApp “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1468716985789796354"&gt;the best farewell gift from the best team ever!&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ4ain"&gt;While WhatsApp’s US payment plans revolve around Novi and cryptocurrency, elsewhere in the world it’s already offering payments using traditional fiat currencies. The feature got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552325/whatsapp-payment-service-india-launches-regulatory-approval-upi-graded-ncpi"&gt;widespread rollout in India last year&lt;/a&gt;, and has also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22420029/whatsapp-payments-brazil-launch-regulations-fight"&gt; launched in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
