    <title>US admits Xiaomi isn’t a ‘Communist Chinese military company’ after all</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9m2EFh"&gt;The US has formally removed Xiaomi from its trading blacklist. The US District Court for the District of Columbia issued a final order yesterday that vacated the Department of Defense’s designation of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company” (CCMC), which would have prohibited Americans from investing in the Chinese consumer tech giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9M4GMQ"&gt;“The Company is grateful for the trust and support of its global users, partners, employees and shareholders,” a Xiaomi spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The Company reiterates that it is an open, transparent, publicly traded, independently operated and managed corporation. The Company will continue to provide reliable consumer electronics products and services to users, and to relentlessly build amazing products with honest prices to let everyone in the world enjoy a better life through innovative technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQ7x0i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The blacklisting was described as ‘arbitrary and capricious’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kegxF6"&gt;The US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231786/trump-administration-blacklists-xiaomi-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; the CCMC designation on January 14th, in the final week of the Trump administration. Xiaomi sued the government the following month, and in March won a preliminary injunction blocking the designation, with a judge describing the blacklisting as “arbitrary and capricious.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22431838/xiaomi-us-blacklist-remove-trump-lawsuit"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; Xiaomi and the DoD announced that they’d come to an agreement to resolve the matter among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aslnUi"&gt;While Xiaomi has managed to get out of its tangle with the US government, the Biden administration hasn’t given any indication that Trump’s sanctions targeting Huawei will be lifted. Huawei’s consumer division has been crippled by the resulting inability to do business with companies based in the US, but the company also makes network equipment that several politicians have accused of posing a national security threat. This week founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei reportedly sent an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452580/huawei-software-pivot-us-sanctions-ren-zhengfei"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt; to staff saying that Huawei should pivot to software as a way to get around US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amnesty International calls for Google to halt cloud business in Saudi Arabia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbKDtmt2zQyQxLWAZOekUAlWxiI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343408/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A6JeUa"&gt;Amnesty International is teaming up with 38 other human rights groups and individuals &lt;a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/google-must-halt-plans-to-establish-cloud-region-in-saudi-arabia/"&gt;to call for a halt&lt;/a&gt; to Google’s plans to set up an enterprise cloud business in Saudi Arabia because of concerns over the country’s human rights track record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyVNx3"&gt;The joint statement — signed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Media Matters for Democracy, among others — calls for Google to end its plans in Saudi Arabia until the company conducts a public human rights assessment and makes it clear what kinds of government requests for data it won’t honor. Even more important, the letter writers state, is conducting that investigation in the open, actually consulting with the people Google could inadvertently help Saudi Arabia to hurt, and speaking to groups in the country who can better understand the issues there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmN9Ul"&gt;The organizations cite several human rights violations that they argue should give Google pause. Saudi Arabia has a documented history of seeking to spy on and violate its citizen’s privacy, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952335/twitter-employees-saudi-arabia-spying-arrests"&gt;allegedly recruiting Twitter employees&lt;/a&gt; to spy on the company from within. It’s also taken extreme and violent measures to silence dissent from people in positions to criticize, most recently with the murder and dismemberment of &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; journalist &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/10/17/17989638/jamal-khashoggi-murder-wsj-nyt-dismember"&gt;Jamal Khashoggi in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3Okoy"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-cloud-announces-new-regions"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; it was making Saudi Arabia one of its new “Cloud Regions” in 2020, with plans to build cloud infrastructure and partner with Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to resell enterprise cloud services. The announcement sparked a response from activists groups like &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/google-cloud-in-saudi-arabia-human-rights-concerns/"&gt;Access Now and the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, particularly because Google’s original blog post included a quote from Snap, the creators of Snapchat, promoting the business, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/google-cloud-saudi-arabia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The quote has since been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hplPdH"&gt;According to Access Now, Google told concerned groups that it had conducted an independent human rights assessment of its future cloud region and taken steps to address issues it had identified. But the company didn’t share what those issues were or what it did, motivating in part the groups and individuals calling out the company today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>USB-C is about to go from 100W to 240W, enough to power beefier laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="usb-c" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfPGJesdR1-knr-FiIU3Kq5eAxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342740/vlad-savov-computex-usb-c-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tD3Vf4"&gt;Soon, the majority of portable PCs &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; need to be equipped with an ugly barrel jack and a proprietary power brick to charge. &lt;a href="https://usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-21"&gt;The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) has just announced&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-c-upgrade-delivers-a-whopping-240w-for-gaming-laptops-and-other-power-hungry-devices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that it’s &lt;em&gt;more than doubling&lt;/em&gt; the amount of power you can send over a USB-C cable to 240 watts, which means you’ll eventually be able to plug in the same kind of multipurpose USB-C cable you currently use on lightweight laptops, tablets, and phones to charge all but the beefiest gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXBIkF"&gt;Previously, the USB-C Power Delivery spec tops out at 100 watts, and it’s definitely held the industry back a tad — for example, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;my own Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; can technically charge over USB-C, it needs 130W of power to charge and run at full bore simultaneously. Some manufacturers have sold off-spec USB-C adapters (I have a Dell dock that outputs 130W), but they don’t always come bundled with machines and generally have a fixed, non-detachable cable to prevent against misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OOYLBI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Leaving 100W behind&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BJFjy9"&gt;But with 240W of power — something that the USB-IF is calling “Extended Power Range” or EPR for short — you could theoretically charge an full-fat Alienware m17 gaming laptop over USB-C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FP2MX"&gt;You’ll need new USB-C chargers and cables to take advantage of the new spec, of course, though you should hopefully be able to tell which is which: “All EPR cables shall be visibly identified with EPR cable identification items,” reads part of the USB-IF’s requirements for the new spec. A cable will need to support up to 5A and 50V to be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RINDgV"&gt;Judging by the photos below, it looks like manufacturers may need to tweak their charger designs as well:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Je4SzM6dk6tl925_VIrP_ysL0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539782/epr_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Svmwh"&gt;There will still be exceptionally beefy laptops that demand more than 240W of power, of course. 330W power supplies still come standard with some machines, and there are always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/22/15672294/acer-predator-21-x-review-gaming-laptop-9000-gtx-1080"&gt;exotic notebooks that require more than one power supply to function&lt;/a&gt;. Gaming desktops generally require far more power, with a 650W PSU or higher PSU required for the latest desktop graphics cards, and 240W &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/14/22230943/ps5-xbox-series-x-s-power-consumption-study-nrdc#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20not%20provided%20official,slightly%20lower%20at%20340%20watts."&gt;may not be &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; enough for the latest game consoles&lt;/a&gt; from Sony and Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4rstM"&gt;On the other hand, some computers are getting more efficient as the years go by. Case in point: the colorful new iMac &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fimac-24%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453936%2Fusb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comes with a 143W power adapter&lt;/a&gt;. In a year or two, it’d be a viable candidate for USB-C power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1LHlW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero 6 and Pro 6 owners are now getting Apple’s HomeKit security features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eero 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZRxpe6AmJTfRembxdj0gg1Nl6ZE=/0x0:1162x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342649/eero6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaRHCK"&gt;Owners of Amazon’s Eero 6 and Pro 6 routers will now be able to isolate their HomeKit IoT devices from the rest of their home network and the wider internet, thanks to a new integration with Apple’s HomeKit that’s now rolling out (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/eero-6-routers-homekit-support/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new feature is coming as part of a firmware update, and makes the routers some of the first Wi-Fi 6 systems that support Apple’s integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdrph"&gt;The added feature may be welcome, but it’s probably not a surprise for those who have been paying attention: Eero’s other, cheaper routers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/2/26/21154531/amazon-eero-routers-apple-homekit-support-internet-connection-security"&gt;updated to support it in February, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and an Eero Support account &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/jnyua3/got_new_eero_6_pro_no_homekit_support/"&gt;mentioned in November&lt;/a&gt; that the router was going through Apple’s certification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdjsQQ"&gt;Setting up your Eero (or any other supported routers) with HomeKit lets you manage how much data your other HomeKit devices are allowed to share over the network. If, for example, you had some smart window blinds that were a bit shady, you could use HomeKit to only allow them to talk to your local HomeKit Hub, and not connect to the internet (or other apps). It’s a niche benefit, to be sure, but if you were holding off on an Eero 6 purchase until it was available, it looks like the time has finally come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbIgjS"&gt;It’s worth noting that, to use the feature, a separate HomeKit Hub is required: this can be either an Apple TV, HomePod (regular or Mini), or iPad that stays in the house. If you want to activate HomeKit on your Eero router, the company &lt;a href="https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036319531-How-to-use-HomeKit-with-your-eero-Network"&gt;has a support page&lt;/a&gt; laying out all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of Amazon employees call for Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy to support Palestine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MmzNnvHAcG5k0tu8EBNvT0TXa0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342425/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8bQtTD"&gt;More than 500 Amazon employees have signed an internal letter to Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy calling for the company to acknowledge the plight of the Palestinian people. The move comes after Israeli airstrikes devastated Palestinians in Gaza, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-truce-between-israel-hamas-begins-mediated-by-egypt-2021-05-20/"&gt;leaving 248 people dead&lt;/a&gt;. Hamas and Israel have since agreed to a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zCTFy"&gt;“We ask Amazon leadership to acknowledge the continued assault upon Palestinians’ basic human rights under an illegal occupation... without using language that implies a power symmetry or situational equivalency, which minimizes and misrepresents the disruption, destruction, and death that has disproportionately been inflicted upon the Palestinians in recent days and over several decades,” employees wrote. “Amazon employs Palestinians in Tel Aviv and Haifa offices and around the world. Ignoring the suffering faced by Palestinians and their families at home erases our Palestinian coworkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnqd35"&gt;Employees want the company to terminate business contracts with organizations that are complicit in human rights violations, like the Israeli Defense Forces. In April, Amazon and Google &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-picks-amazons-aws-google-flagship-cloud-project-2021-04-21/"&gt;signed a $1.2 billion cloud computing contract&lt;/a&gt; with the Israeli government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeYbSg"&gt;The note echoes similar petitions from workers at Apple and Google. On May 18th, Jewish employees at Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441236/jewish-google-employees-support-palestine-letter-anti-zionism-israel"&gt;penned a letter to Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt; calling for the company to “reject any definition of antisemitism that holds that criticism of Israel or Zionism is antisemitic.” Two days later, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;note from Muslim employees at Apple&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgYISa"&gt;Muslim tech workers say executives have been slow to voice support for Palestinians, or condemn the violence in Gaza. Many feel their CEOs are choosing to ignore Israeli human rights abuses because the situation is fraught. The result, according to multiple sources, is that Muslims in tech feel undervalued and ignored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6DNuN"&gt;Read the entire letter from Amazon employees below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uqoHZM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10518685"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t0mdFJ"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jaguar I-Pace is Google’s first electric Street View car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jvQ-CY8bZFn66rBgRb-s9Lhm4I=/0x115:2776x1966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342344/Jaguar_I_PACE_x_Google_Street_1b.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yo0Hgo"&gt;Google finally has its first all-electric vehicle for capturing Street View. The tech giant and Jaguar Land Rover announced today that they have collaborated to rig up an all-electric I-Pace SUV with the equipment required to capture Street View imagery, and deployed the car in Dublin, Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ii5hbB"&gt;The I-Pace will also collect more general Google Maps data, and it will be outfitted with air quality sensors from Aclima — something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/29/9067171/street-view-car-air-quality-detection-google-aclima"&gt;Google has done with its Street View cars for the better part of the last decade&lt;/a&gt;. The I-Pace will collect “street-by-street air quality” data in Dublin, measuring nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as fine particles. Google will make the data available to the Dublin City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ureA9b"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover and Google are no strangers. Sibling company Waymo — which began as an autonomous vehicle project inside Google but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13936782/google-self-driving-car-waymo-spin-off-company"&gt;was spun out in 2016&lt;/a&gt; — uses Jaguar I-Paces in its &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/03/waymo-jaguar-i-pace-black/"&gt;self-driving car tests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtSoc9"&gt;“We’re always looking for opportunities to improve our fleet of vehicles and there is the potential to increase our EV fleet size in the future, but no updates to share at this time,” a spokesperson for Google said when asked whether the company plans to use any more electric cars for Street View. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVcT6K"&gt;Launched in 2018, the $70,000 I-Pace gets around 246 miles on a full charge (after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21003647/jaguar-i-pace-software-update-range-bump-12-miles"&gt;software update increased the range in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philo is the latest live TV streaming service to get a price hike</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezTqVe"&gt;Philo has become the latest live TV option for cord-cutters hoping to skirt cable contracts to get a price bump — but there’s a workaround for current subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja9dwm"&gt;Beginning June 8th, Philo’s monthly subscription cost for incoming customers will hike to $25 from $20. But those who are subscribed to the service before that date will be able to keep their plans at the current cost with no change, Philo CEO Andrew McCollum said in a Tuesday &lt;a href="https://blog.philo.com/posts/package-and-price-changes"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s blog. To offset the price increase, Philo will be increasing its unlimited DVR storage period to a full year, up from 30 days, and existing customers who’d like to upgrade their storage will be able to bump up to the new price tier if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QueStn"&gt;McCollum cited an increase in contract fees with content partners as being behind the price change. Philo is “relentless in our focus on keeping our price low,” McCollum said, but the company “can’t offset these rising costs indefinitely, and this change reflects that reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMEl18"&gt;Philo’s hardly the only cable alternative of late to get a price hike. Other live TV cord-cutting services that have seen their subscription prices rise over the last couple of years include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309678/fubo-tv-subscription-price-increase-cost-family-plan-standard-youtube-disney-warnermedia"&gt;Fubo TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt;, all of which currently start at around $65 per month before any additional premium add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4b4ccs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Philo is seeing its first official price hike since launching in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UthzVw"&gt;Philo reported last November that it had reached &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/streaming-tv-philo-launches-whimsical-170000482.html"&gt;800,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it’s substantially smaller than larger live TV services like YouTube TV and Hulu with Live TV, both of which have subscriber figures in the millions. It hasn’t technically seen a price hike since its launch back in 2017 (though it did initially offer a cheaper “skinny” tier that cost $16 per month before &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/philo-discontinue-cheaper-skinny-bundle-1203194495/"&gt;the plan was axed&lt;/a&gt; in 2019). And at $25, it still remains one of the cheapest ways to access live and linear TV, particularly given its unlimited DVR and 63 live channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa0TVG"&gt;But with Philo, you will be missing out on some premium features available on other services. For example, the service doesn’t include dedicated live sports channels, but some of its channels do occasionally run live sports programming. It also lacks local news channels, and its live channels only stream in 720p resolution while on-demand programming streams in 1080p. Philo also doesn’t have originals, though a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that original programming “is something we may consider in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKWLLs"&gt;If you’ve been considering a Philo subscription, now’s the time to get it. June 8th is swiftly approaching, and that extra $5 a month starts to add up — particularly when accounting for any number of other subscriptions you may already be paying for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA for US Congresspeople: Please do not enter your phone’s passcode on TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 looks great. The new design feels both modern and classic." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIM4IFgjVzP_Qy-U19nbpKnIROA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341948/vpavic_4243_20201017_0088.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jn082c"&gt;Hello again, it has come to my attention that Republican Senator Ted Cruz and I are in perfect alignment on one issue: if you enter your iPhone passcode on live TV, you need to change the passcode. This means you &lt;em&gt;in particular&lt;/em&gt;, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEq677"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I recognize it’s happened before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7yehk"&gt;I honestly didn’t think anyone needed to explain this, particularly since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/11/17964848/kanye-west-iphone-passcode-trump-iplane-apple-meeting"&gt;Kanye West accidentally revealed his passcode&lt;/a&gt; (000000, in case you are curious) during a video with then-president Donald Trump in 2018. But here we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfd31R"&gt;If you are a member of the US federal government, you are a desirable target for all kinds of hackers, most of whom do not have your best interests at heart. Your phone stores a lot of sensitive data about where you go, who you talk to, and so on that can be used to target you for nefarious purposes. Also, since it is usually with you, if spyware is installed, you are potentially now giving God-knows-who access to your camera and your microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vt2AAm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz to Sen. Richard Blumenthal after he held up his iPhone and entered in the pass code on live TV: “Senator Blumenthal, I would note you put out on CSPAN the code on your iPhone, so you might want to change that now.“ &lt;a href="https://t.co/yNor7oC2ia"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yNor7oC2ia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveGuest/status/1397283551364661249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D8f884"&gt;I am hammering on this very obvious thing because of Blumenthal’s response. “My life is an open book,” he said. Okay, look, assuming Blumenthal has nothing to hide other than some old photos of him making bad sartorial choices — you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don’t want people to get into your phone! &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2016/09/whos-stalking-what-know-about-mobile-spyware"&gt;Spyware is real, and it’s scary&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nejmnz/when-technology-takes-hostages-the-rise-of-stalkerware"&gt;Survivors of domestic abuse&lt;/a&gt; certainly know this.) If you’re regularly handling important affairs of state, you should &lt;em&gt;definitely &lt;/em&gt;try to make it harder to surveil you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Il3GQI"&gt;And then! Blumenthal says something worse! “I recognize it’s happened before,” he says. &lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt; Sir. Entering your passcode on TV &lt;em&gt;one time&lt;/em&gt; is too many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvFmGi"&gt;Look, I recognize no actual congresspeople are going to read this — I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"&gt;I warned about Venmo a month ago&lt;/a&gt;, and then it turned out &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;the actual &lt;em&gt;President&lt;/em&gt; had a public Venmo feed&lt;/a&gt;. I recognize that lawmakers are busy and important and maybe not as up on opsec as we might wish — but can we get them some competent staffers, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers demand company quit polluting near communities of color</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7AOxgGDXM8Y7mSCdYiOjxTjy2J8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341910/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qa8Zu1"&gt;Hundreds of Amazon tech workers are pressuring Amazon to quit polluting — especially in  communities near its warehouses. More than 600 workers signed a &lt;a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/Xsul4-F6BUuVi_MofTP5YA2"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; asking Amazon to bring its pollution down to zero by 2030. They also called on the company to prioritize deploying zero-emissions technologies near the communities hit hardest by Amazon’s pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJCvMJ"&gt;The petition was started after Amazon rejected a shareholder resolution asking the company to report how much pollution it emits in communities of color. Amazon says the proposal was similar to a resolution that was voted down by shareholders last year. Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCVx00"&gt;Amazon’s warehouses have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;mushroomed&lt;/a&gt; around working-class communities&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;predominately made up of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;households of color, activists say. Those warehouses are &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/san-bernardino-county-california-air-pollution-logistics-industry/"&gt;magnets for pollution&lt;/a&gt; from diesel trucks, trains, and planes that are constantly moving goods to and from the warehouses for the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;e-commerce giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AByJ9P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They show up with warehouses and delivery trucks that worsen our roads, our air”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgOF4S"&gt;“Amazon shows up without informing the community about their encroachment. They show up with warehouses and delivery trucks that worsen our roads, our air.” Paola Dela Cruz-Perez, a youth organizer for the nonprofit East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice said during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNWsJB2cTI0"&gt;shareholder briefing&lt;/a&gt; held today. “Amazon has been expanding their operations in Southeast L.A. neighborhoods like my own by exactly understanding how environmental racism works, and choosing to profit from this oppression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFEGjF"&gt;The workers organizing the petition are part of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. “As employees, we are alarmed that Amazon’s pollution is disproportionately concentrated in communities of color,” they said &lt;a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/Xsul4-F6BUuVi_MofTP5YA2"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We want to be proud of where we work. A company that lives up to its statements about racial equity and closes the racial equity gaps in its operations is a critical part of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPL1HZ"&gt;It’s not the first time Amazon employees have pushed the company to create better environmental policies. In 2019, more than 7,500 workers backed a shareholder proposal asking Jeff Bezos to create a comprehensive climate change plan for the organization. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/22/18635604/amazon-shareholder-meeting-2019-climate-change-proposal"&gt;While the proposal was ultimately shot down&lt;/a&gt;, it marked the first time tech workers had used their stock to push for real change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r1sfb"&gt;Amazon workers have led a wave of employee activism in the tech industry, specifically related to Big Tech’s impact on the environment. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/20/amazon-google-other-tech-employees-protest-support-climate-action/"&gt;thousands of workers at Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook&lt;/a&gt; walked out of work to protest a lack of action on climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOI4rh"&gt;Shortly before the walkout was scheduled to take place, Jeff Bezos announced he would be rolling out a fleet of electric delivery vans by 2024. The news did not change employees’ plans to protest, as they wanted to see stronger action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3wkDuN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Jeff Bezos has faced a lot of heat for flaunting Amazon’s environmental credentials while his business continues to pollute neighborhoods&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OWhxg0"&gt;In 2020, Amazon fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, two key organizers with the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. The company said the employees had violated a company policy which banned workers from speaking out about the business. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html"&gt;National Labor Relations Board has determined the firings were retaliatory and illegal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iZVyW"&gt;Jeff Bezos has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;faced a lot of heat&lt;/a&gt; for flaunting Amazon’s environmental credentials and promoting his own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321793/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-new-president-ceo"&gt;climate action fund&lt;/a&gt; while his business continues to pollute neighborhoods. “He has an opportunity to do so much with the funds that he has provided out there, although I would still consider it chump change compared to the wealth that he has accumulated off the backs of our people,” Gabriela Mendez, a community organizer with the nonprofit Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice (CCAEJ), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcvwtX"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2040, meaning that it won’t release more planet-heating carbon dioxide than it can capture or offset. But that commitment still leaves room for Amazon to keep producing some pollution, as long as it invests in carbon removal technologies, forest restoration, or other measures to cancel out its effects on the climate. The pledge also doesn’t address other harmful pollutants from tailpipes. Amazon workers are asking the company to completely eliminate emissions instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkyltV"&gt;Amazon does have other initiatives that could cut down CO2 and other pollution. By 2030, the company wants to roll out 100,000 electric delivery vehicles. Amazon also plans to run its operations on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;100 percent renewable energy by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gU7D7C"&gt;“We’re committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet, and using our size and scale for good. This includes investing heavily to build an environmentally-sustainable business and support the communities where we operate,” a spokesperson for Amazon said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFUp8j"&gt;Amazon shareholders will vote on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399329/amazon-shareholders-plastic-packaging-waste-pollution"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; on May 26th aimed at tackling the company’s plastic pollution. The proposal asks the company to report how much of its plastic packaging ends up in the environment, and comes after Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana"&gt;disputed estimates&lt;/a&gt; from the nonprofit group Oceana that 22 million pounds of its plastic waste polluted freshwater and marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEBEIH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government decides pipeline cybersecurity ought to be regulated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. Department of Homeland Security" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jJOUeP4gvloEm8vxipstfvo6oHY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341678/649149526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NgPfut"&gt;The hack of the Colonial Pipeline — which kneecapped oil availability on the East Coast for almost two weeks — was as disastrous as it was likely preventable. A branch of the Department of Homeland Security, however, is hoping to correct course by changing the rules on cybersecurity and disclosure for Colonial and other companies in the pipeline industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmsd94"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/25/colonial-hack-pipeline-dhs-cybersecurity/"&gt;As reported b&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Transportation Security Administration (yes, the same sub-branch of DHS everyone associates with taking their shoes off in airports) will be requiring pipeline companies to report breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, with additional rules on how to keep these critical infrastructure systems secure from digital threats arriving “in coming weeks.” Any sort of abnormality which could, say, cause a company to part with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;$4.4 million&lt;/a&gt; in ransom money, would need to be reported to both the TSA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrmCiN"&gt;Incidentally, guidelines already exist to keep these sorts of systems secure — following them was merely voluntary. Companies were also free to decline inspections of their systems by the TSA. (We’ve reached out to Colonial to see if it chose to duck any such inspection.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNHszQ"&gt;According to an anonymous source within the agency who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, failing to meet the forthcoming requirements is likely to result in financial penalties, though how much is unclear. They would have to be fairly substantial in order to change the essential calculus. As &lt;a href="https://walton.uark.edu/insights/why-companies-arent-investing-in-cybersecurity.php"&gt;Wharton researchers point out&lt;/a&gt;, the average cost of a breach in 2017 was just north of $7 million — not a massive expenditure compared to say, the price tag for implementing top-notch cybersecurity across a swath of legacy systems; they also found that “in the short run, the market jumps in fright after disclosure of a breach, but in a longer period of time (even just a month), there is hardly a difference between a breached and an un-breached company.” In short: a successful breach does very little to a company’s bottom line, either through immediate costs or longer-term stock valuation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hwVn2g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In short: a successful breach does very little to a company’s bottom line&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbxxO"&gt;Essentially, TSA’s new rules will need to have substantial power to inflict financial hardship, or companies probably will not have much incentive to change their lax habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mCzoQ"&gt;That these decisions are driven entirely by profits is nowhere better exemplified than by the Colonial hack itself, which did nothing at all to harm the actual systems responsible for delivering fuel: what was compromised, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;, was Colonial’s billing system, and the protracted shutdown was due largely to the company being unable to determine how much customers would have owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxVqoO"&gt;Even assuming pipeline companies are broadly cooperative, the TSA is setting itself up for a Sisyphean task of overseeing over &lt;a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/faqs/general-pipeline-faqs"&gt;2 million&lt;/a&gt; miles of pipeline with a staff — as of 2019 — of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/25/colonial-hack-pipeline-dhs-cybersecurity/"&gt;just five auditors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K74jZI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
