    <title>Facebook encourages hate speech for profit, says whistleblower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_GB8DFDxs2V5EqaZTlvK8KyrDD0=/387x0:2388x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69946435/7CF1506A_B241_40D9_9565_05E4C77C2DC7.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen appears on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjQkgB"&gt;The whistleblower behind the leak of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;an enormous cache of Facebook documents&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Frances Haugen, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/"&gt;went public on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, revealing more of the inner workings the most powerful social media platform in the world. Revealing her identity on national television, Haugen described a company so committed to product optimization that it embraced algorithms that amplify hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNTay4"&gt;“It’s paying for its profits with our safety,” Haugen told &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; host Scott Pelley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4boPU"&gt;According to a since deleted LinkedIn profile Haugen was a product manager at Facebook assigned to the Civic Integrity group. She chose to leave the company in 2021 after the dissolving of the group. She said she didn’t “trust that they’re willing to invest what actually needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5cFvGm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was conflict... between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PV1Jdl"&gt;Consequently she leaked a cache of internal research to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the hopes of driving better regulation of the company. She noted that she had worked at a number of companies, including Google and Pinterest, but that “it was substantially worse at Facebook” due to the company’s desire to put its profits over the welfare of its users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJrYKb"&gt;“There was conflict... between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” Haugen told Pelley, “and Facebook chose over and over again to optimize for its own interests — like making more money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSIrpG"&gt;While the company repeatedly claims it is helping stop hate speech, at least on its own products, one internal Facebook document leaked by Haugen says, “We estimate that we may action as little as 3-5% of hate and ~0.6% of V&amp;amp;I [Violence and Incitement] on Facebook despite being the best in the world at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ruHTer"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” said an internal document&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4KuvT"&gt;Another document was even more blunt. “We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ4FXB"&gt;Haugen claims the root of the problem is the algorithims rolled out in 2018 that govern what you see on the platform. According to her they are meant to drive engagement and the company has found that the best engagement is the kind instilling fear and hate in users. “Its easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,” Hagen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfYOL5"&gt;At the time, Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions"&gt;presented the algorithm changes as positive&lt;/a&gt;. “We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaTR4c"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting on Haugen’s concerns, the result was a sharp turn towards anger and hate. “Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” said one internal memo quoted by the Journal, assessing the effects of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITqMKf"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; began publishing its findings from the cache under the name “The Facebook Files” in September. One report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;alleging Facebook had research proving Instagram harmed teenage girls&lt;/a&gt; has since led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;. Ahead of the hearing Facebook attempted to change the narrative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, which reproduced two of the reports referred to in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irvkLs"&gt;Ahead of the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; report, Facebook attempted the same deflections in a different form. Facebook Vice President of Global Affair Nick Clegg appeared on CNN’s &lt;em&gt;Reliable Sources&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ReliableSources/status/1444730430461251585?s=20"&gt;to defend the company&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday afternoon, just hours before Haugen would appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsEpXw"&gt;“I think that’s ludicrous,” Clegg said of the allegation that social media was responsible for the January 6 riots. “I think it gives people false comfort to assume that there must be a technological, or technical, explanation for the issues of political polarization in the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bkYb9"&gt;Haugen ended the interview by calling for regulation of social networks more broadly, something Facebook itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/19/21142478/facebook-regulation-content-moderation-singapore-pakistan"&gt;has called for&lt;/a&gt; in more limited form. She is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/facebook-whistleblower-testify-us-senate-hearing-next-week-lawmakers-say-2021-09-29/"&gt;scheduled to appear before a Senate Commerce&lt;/a&gt; panel on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Eternals, Welcome to Earth, The Girl in the Woods, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9rfnfdYaZO_96uwjg-qkqoGrPD0=/371x0:1546x783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69945868/eternals.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eternals comes to theaters November 5th | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHpUqVktG74&amp;amp;ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment" target="_blank"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6bQzf"&gt;So we had the big heel turn that’s been hinted at all season, plus some big moments for two of the show’s couples, which made &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s penultimate episode of season two very stressful to watch (for me, at least). I have no idea how they will wrap it all up in the finale; I think we’re headed for a cliffhanger on at least one front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93QeWc"&gt;There’s too much good on streaming right now, it’s really a nice problem to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSAITj"&gt;Here’s this week’s trailers roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJ7tMu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHpUqVktG74?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pBbLLZ"&gt;Eternals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2cqgG"&gt;A brand-new trailer for Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; has some of the action sequences we’ve seen in prior teaser/trailers, plus, a first look at Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, along with his husband and son, apparently the first queer couple in the MCU to appear on the big screen (h/t &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Poc55U2RPMw&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for that detail). To recap: The&lt;em&gt; Eternals&lt;/em&gt; are mega-hero guardians who have been waiting to jump in and help humanity and have decided the time is now. Also starring Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, and Kit Harington, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxgnYe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0MTCXgil1M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="THroja"&gt;Welcome to Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6gnhiT"&gt;Will Smith opens this trailer with a confession: he’s never climbed a mountain or swum in a lake and is beginning to think he might be missing something. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Earth&lt;/em&gt; is a six-part series from National Geographic— with its usual stunning location photography— that follows Smith on a trip around the world to some out-of-the-way places. It arrives on Disney Plus In December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDXFqP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKJOsy3Kf18?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PjMonH"&gt;Sexy Beasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="a60CKY"&gt;This ... unusual dating show where people wear elaborate animal/monster/creature costumes and makeup to hide their looks from potential suitors so they can be judged only on their personalities is back for a second season for some reason. The trailer leans all the way in to the weirdness, using &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/7/21/22587027/sexy-beasts-netflix"&gt;quotes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/06/netflixs-sexy-beasts-is-a-dating-show-fever-dream.html"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; like “A sign of the end times” and “the stuff of nightmares, truly,” which sort of begs the question: did we really need a second season? Clearly Netflix thought so. Season two of &lt;em&gt;Sexy Beasts&lt;/em&gt; premieres October 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="knrChD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7MudPmb8s8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oJKX6o"&gt;The Girl in the Woods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dDEU0V"&gt;A girl in the Pacific Northwest escapes from a colony of mysterious people who live behind a door in the woods, and guard the world from monsters. Krysten Ritter signed on to direct some episodes of the series, which stars Stefanie Scott, Misha Osherovich, Sofia Bryant Will Yun Lee, Reed Diamond, and Leonard Roberts. &lt;em&gt;The Girl in The Woods &lt;/em&gt;comes to Peacock October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZoZcTY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Poc55U2RPMw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2ytEGa"&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="goxsb0"&gt;We got a teaser for this western about rival outlaw gangs back in June, but here’s our first official trailer and a release date for the impossibly star-studded &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall. &lt;/em&gt;We get a little more backstory for Nat Love and why he’s gunning (literally) for Rufus Buck, who just broke out of a train car where he was imprisoned. Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, Idris Elba, Delroy Lindo, Damon Wayans, Jr. and Regina King star in&lt;em&gt; The Harder They Fall,&lt;/em&gt; coming to Netflix November 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Ocxy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Europe-Japan mission to Mercury sends back photos of the planet’s cratered surface</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q7ZgZtt25Cm3_ktf6aJNgys4Fe8=/3x85:1021x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69945193/Hello_Mercury.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BepiColombo mission snapped this photo of Mercury on October 1st. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2021/10/Hello_Mercury" target="_blank"&gt;ESA/BepiColombo/MTM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3n2YD0"&gt;Photos from a fly-by of Mercury, the least-explored planet in our solar system, show ithas a crater-riddled surface that resembles Earth’s Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeTle2"&gt;The photos came from BepiColombo, a joint mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) that launched from Europe’s Spaceport in 2018. The mission has two linked orbiting spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter. The mission is planned to reach Mercury’s orbit in late 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZD0PR"&gt;BepiColombo aims to gather more information about Mercury and its composition, and how it evolved so close to our Sun. Temperatures on Mercury can exceed 350 degrees Celsius, or about 660 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fazrvd"&gt;ESA explains where the craters came from and what the surface of the planet is believed to be like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VOxC8w"&gt;One theory is that it may have begun as a larger body that was then stripped of most of its rock by a giant impact. This left it with a relatively large iron core, where its magnetic field is generated, and only a thin rocky outer shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqRKtU"&gt;Mercury has no equivalent to the ancient bright lunar highlands: its surface is dark almost everywhere, and was formed by vast outpourings of lava billions of years ago. These lava flows bear the scars of craters formed by asteroids and comets crashing onto the surface at speeds of tens of kilometers per hour. The floors of some of the older and larger craters have been flooded by younger lava flows, and there are also more than a hundred sites where volcanic explosions have ruptured the surface from below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="b6HoXH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello, Mercury!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This splendid view of part of Mercury's northern hemisphere was captured by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ESA_MTM?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ESA_MTM&lt;/a&gt; about 10 mins after &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MercuryFlyby?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MercuryFlyby&lt;/a&gt; close approach, from a distance of 2420km. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jjGKrsQXDH"&gt;https://t.co/jjGKrsQXDH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ExploreFarther?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ExploreFarther&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EMhMJ5tKiN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EMhMJ5tKiN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bepi (@ESA_Bepi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ESA_Bepi/status/1444218331595169795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bLq88W"&gt;BepiColombo is named for Italian scientist &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESA_history/Giuseppe_Bepi_Colombo_Grandfather_of_the_fly-by"&gt;Giuseppe “Bepi” Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, who helped develop the gravity assist procedure that the first spacecraft sent to Mercury, NASA’s Mariner 10, used in 1974. The fly-bys allow the spacecraft to use Mercury’s gravity to enter the planet’s orbit. Friday’s fly-by of Mercury was the first of six planned before it enters the planet’s orbit for closer study. BepiColombo will also build on data collected by NASA’s Messenger mission, which orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EM7if1"&gt;As the spacecraft get closer to Mercury, it will be able to take higher-res images. More images from Friday’s fly-by will be available in the coming days, ESA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gICFi4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SNL says what we were all thinking in its billionaire Star Trek sketch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Launch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpoIbEfAhiAwUAVP76_nr0eZx9k=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69944523/1329693390.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft lifts off from the launch pad on July 20th. | Photo by Joe Raedle / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omwaS7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; returned this weekend and the show wasted no time taking aim at the weird &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;billionaire space tourism race&lt;/a&gt; that unfolded over the past few months. Guest host Owen Wilson played former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a sketch about a fictional new show called &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Ego Quest, &lt;/em&gt;about “the voyages of the SS New Shepard and its crew of random weirdos,” whose mission is “to just sort of fly around space goofing off in a ship that looks like a penis,” according to the voiceover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5lNg4"&gt;You’ll recall the real &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22580542/jeff-bezos-space-launch-live-stream-time-date-blue-origin-ns16-new-shepard"&gt;Bezos traveled to the edge&lt;/a&gt; of space in Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket in July, along with a crew that included his brother Mark (played in the sketch by Wilson’s brother Luke), 82-year-old pilot and space legend Wally Funk, and Dutch high school student Oliver Daemen. But Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin Galactic, beat Bezos to space by few days when he took a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;trip aboard his company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22667339/spacex-inspiration4-first-all-civilian-crew-dragon"&gt;SpaceX sent its first crew of private citizens&lt;/a&gt; into space earlier this month, but CEO Elon Musk didn’t join them for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOT9c7"&gt;In the SNL sketch, Branson (Alex Moffatt), flying nearby in a ship with purple mood lighting, challenges Bezos to a race after they exchange some standard bro greetings for a flight the voiceover refers to as “a midlife crisis of cosmic proportions,” in which they accidentally wreck into the international space station. But wait, danger lurks around every corner: Suddenly Bezos’ ship is being pelted by photon torpedoes and yes of course it’s Elon Musk (Mikey Day, doing a spot-on impression of Musk’s speaking style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKZQnW"&gt; “Space is only big enough for one white, weird billionaire,” “Musk” tells “Bezos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zW9Gdf"&gt;In reality, of course, neither Bezos or Musk has had much of a sense of humor about the other’s space aspirations. “You cannot sue your way to the moon,” the real &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699254/musk-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-code-confernce-2021"&gt;Musk told journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; in an interview last week while discussing Bezos and Blue Origin. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700600/amazon-elon-musk-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-spacex-lawsuits"&gt;Amazon sent&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; a 13-page PDF&lt;/a&gt; list that included all the times SpaceX has filed lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqrH5Z"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; sketch took one last jab at Bezos before it wrapped: an Amazon employee (Kenan Thompson) beams aboard Bezos’ ship to deliver a package, and before he beams out asks to use the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2WSvh"&gt;Wilson-as-Bezos tosses him a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;plastic bottle.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford and GM working toward settlement over the term ‘Cruise’ for hands-free driving</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="brMA7O"&gt;Ford and General Motors told a federal judge they’re planning to settle a trademark battle over the term “Cruise” to describe hands-free driving. Attorneys for the automakers said they’re working out the terms of the settlement and &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22897484/cruise_vs_ford_settlement_notice.pdf"&gt;asked the court for a conditional dismissa&lt;/a&gt;l. The two sides will report back within 60 days if they’re unable to come to an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEsNfw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist feature in April. The legal skirmish began in July, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591805/gm-cruise-lawsuit-trademark-infringement-hands-free-driving-autonomous"&gt;GM filed a trademark infringement lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the name BlueCruise was too close to its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise, as well as Super Cruise, the name of the hands-free driving tech GM introduced in 2017.  GM said in its complaint that the two the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to come to agreement. GM said it introduced Super Cruise in 2012, and its Cruise self-driving subsidiary has been in business since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0yuxU"&gt;In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/14/22624945/ford-dismiss-cruise-gm-lawsuit-driver-assist-blue-cruise"&gt;Ford filed a motion&lt;/a&gt; to have the suit dismissed, arguing that the term “cruise” had been been in “ubiquitous use” for 50 years as a term for driver-assist features, a term that consumers don’t associate with any one carmaker. A Ford spokesperson called GM’s trademark claims “meritless and frivolous,” adding that Ford had petitioned the US Patent and Trademark Office seeking to have GM’s trademarks of “Cruise” and “SuperCruise” rescinded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXvDjy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLGqQG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A very big eagle escaped from the National Aviary in Pittsburgh and is still at large</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AC4-4nlfGeJaL5K95CU8tEj9ZUw=/0x81:940x708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69942472/kodiak_the_stellers_sea_eagle.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kodiak (Kody) the Steller’s sea eagle, who escaped the National Aviary in Pittsburgh September 29th | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/National_Aviary/status/1444319155843477508?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;National Aviary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJJcYY"&gt;A Steller’s sea eagle &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/kodiak-the-stellers-sea-eagle/"&gt;escaped from its enclosure&lt;/a&gt; at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh last Saturday, and despite the valiant efforts of the Aviary staff, and numerous sightings in the local neighborhood &lt;a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/kodiak-the-sea-eagle-still-missing-in-pittsburgh-has-had-quite-the-weekend/Content?oid=20270465"&gt;posted to social media&lt;/a&gt;, Kodiak —Kody to his friends— is still on the loose and we are all a little worried about him, to be perfectly honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDIQfo"&gt;This is a bird that would be difficult to miss: he’s large (although in Pittsburgh we probably wouldn’t call him “giant” because “Giant Eagle” is a grocery store chain here), with a yellow beak, white tail and white feathers on the tops of his wings. He’s bigger than a bald eagle, and has a wingspan of about six feet. Kody has been spotted in and around the Pittsburgh neighborhood where the Aviary is located, which seems like a good thing. But he’s been tough to catch because you can’t just toss a net over him and call it a day, as licensed falconer Richard Lawson &lt;a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/outdoors/2021/09/30/National-Aviary-Stellers-sea-eagle-missing-bird-Kodiak-Kody-search-Pittsburgh-falconry/stories/202109300130"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; &lt;/em&gt;a specialized (and obviously humane) trap is going to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZVeai"&gt;The Steller’s sea eagle (&lt;em&gt;Haliaeetus pelagicus&lt;/em&gt;) typically weighs between 13 and 20 pounds, and stands about four feet tall. It has no natural predators, &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/our-birds/?category=30"&gt;according to the Aviary&lt;/a&gt;, but Kody has lived in captivity for 15 of his 16 years, so he may be a little rusty on the whole hunting/prey thing. Steller’s sea eagles eat fish, and more fish, “scavenged mammals” (ew) and even other birds “when fish is in short supply.”  And in case you wondered, they’re named for German naturalist &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-W-Steller"&gt;Georg W. Steller&lt;/a&gt;, who encountered the birds on a visit to Alaska in 1741.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdvQfN"&gt;The Aviary has been posting updates to social media and getting tantalizingly close to retrieving Kody, but he’s eluded them so far. I was half-hoping Kody might make some kind of majestic appearance at the Steelers’ game last Sunday since Heinz Field is not far from the Aviary, and the team was at home against the Bengals (we’re not going to talk about that game today, though). Alas, he did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mb6Kcc"&gt;On Thursday, the Aviary’s animal care experts camped out to monitor his roost in a high tree in the North Park area of the city, and they confirmed he was in good condition. They tried to entice him with some food, but he didn’t come down. But look at this handsome, handsome boi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SRH2Wa"&gt;Many people— including me, before I moved to Pittsburgh a thousand years ago— don’t know what a hidden gem the National Aviary is, or, that it’s in Pittsburgh. &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/programs-encounters/animal-encounters/penguin-encounter/"&gt;Their penguins&lt;/a&gt; are usually the big celebrities (hi, this is &lt;a href="https://www.nhl.com/penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;), but they also have very cute— as well as very large—owls, eagles, flamingos, falcons, and canaries among other birds. You can sign up for educational “animal encounters” with many  of the birds— I recall visiting when my son was little; we sat in a large auditorium where some birds of prey were flying around, and we got like a popsicle stick with some food on it (I would prefer not to think about what the food actually was) and you’d hold it up until one of the birds swooped down to eat it. Extremely awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muZhhM"&gt;If you are in Pittsburgh and see Kody call the National Aviary at 412-323-7235. Don’t try to approach him, you run the risk of scaring him off. And when the Aviary team shows up, stay out of their way. They want to get him safely home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC will give away free superhero NFTs to people who register for its FanDome event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zyzyQjsnVl0jvuQvWs-LCHjUOWA=/0x100:600x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69942002/superman.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Superman cover that may be among the NFTs available from DC | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/09/29/dc-x-palm-nft-faqs" target="_blank"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qmmik8"&gt;DC is giving away free non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of its superhero comic book covers to people who register for its October 16th FanDome event. The NFT drop is set for October 5th, and those who &lt;a href="https://www.dcfandome.com/"&gt;register for FanDome&lt;/a&gt; will receive one free, randomly-selected NFT, and become eligible for a second free NFT if they post about their first one on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqYbkl"&gt;The NFTs will come in three levels of rarity; common, rare, and legendary, and will include Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Harley Quinn options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YXr6Up"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LxfZpw"&gt;DC is working on the NFTs with Palm NFT Studio, which the comic maker chose for its “environmentally sustainable and energy efficient” technology, which let the company mint “millions of NFTs for fans with near zero cost,” &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/news/press-releases/dc-partners-palm-nft-studio-epic-digital-collectibles-drop-dc-fandome-2021lm-nft-faqs"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The companies aren’t saying how many comic-book cover NFTs are planned. “This drop pays homage to our 87 year history while visualizing a future in which NFTs play a foundational role in novel ways of interacting with DC content and unlocking new experiences,” DC’s Jim Lee said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBO69C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397238/fandome-dc-zack-snyder-justice-league-batman-robert-pattinson-black-adam-gotham-knights"&gt;Last year’s virtual FanDome&lt;/a&gt;, the first ever for DC Comics and Warner Bros., provided first-look trailers for Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, and Robert Pattison’s turn as &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;. It drew an estimated 22 million views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0PM36"&gt;This year’s lineup is expected to include a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, as well as previews of upcoming movies &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, &lt;/em&gt;new details about the next seasons for its shows &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn, Batwoman, Superman &amp;amp; Lois, and Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, and the next chapter of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite — Batman&lt;/em&gt; crossover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NBCUniversal and YouTubeTV reach agreement to avoid dropped channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the NBC Sunday Night Football..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pkam8ki9vKonbOaWjIQxK5Od5G4=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941898/1224647361.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5IhHkm"&gt;After YouTube TV and NBCUniversal announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;a “short” extension&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday to keep more than a dozen channels on the live TV service, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal say they have finalized a deal — meaning NBC-owned channels will stay put on YouTube TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfn9sz"&gt;“We’re thrilled to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying the full NBCUniversal portfolio of channels,” according to a Saturday &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;update to YouTube’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. “That means you won’t lose access to any of their channels, and YouTube TV will continue to offer 85+ networks for $64.99. We appreciate NBCUniversal’s willingness to work toward an agreement, and we also appreciate your patience as we negotiated with them on your behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imfEEA"&gt;With a deal reached just days after it looked as though the channels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695937/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-carriage-dispute"&gt;could get dropped&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV users will still have access to a dozen-plus channels that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9uT75t"&gt;NBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FXM4fG"&gt;Bravo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6kLUEx"&gt;CNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzHULB"&gt;E!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2YViN7"&gt;Golf Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uD9Jpf"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRIX6q"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4akJE3"&gt;SYFY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Jx8NK"&gt;Telemundo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tx1jfb"&gt;The Olympic Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nh0mtc"&gt;Universal Kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F0LgTZ"&gt;Universo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CLBb8"&gt;USA Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DoKsAs"&gt;Plus, regional sports networks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G9EjTj"&gt;NBC Sports Bay Area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gauL3"&gt;NBC Sports Boston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPTSH"&gt;NBC Sports California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YwwI4q"&gt;NBC Sports Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3okHSr"&gt;NBC Sports Philadelphia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bGCh71"&gt;NBC Sports Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rYhCfK"&gt;SNY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTwmA"&gt;YouTube TV had said that should the service lose the channels, it would have lowered its prices by $10 per month. But with a deal reached, the price will stay the same — and YouTube TV users will still be able to find their TV within one app without needing to subscribe elsewhere to get coverage from NBC-owned properties.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla sold 241,300 cars in the third quarter while other automakers saw big drops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vk3uAyDhCruPDSB7hU60ipYseao=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941646/tesla_model_3_0638.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Li5RpP"&gt;Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars — a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year. It’s the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales"&gt;sold 367,500 in all of 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CDS0d"&gt;The company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter. General Motors, the largest automaker in the US, said &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/01/gm-sales-chip-shortage-suv/5934699001/"&gt;Friday morning&lt;/a&gt; that it only sold 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter — a 33 percent drop from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LlJaq"&gt;Tesla has avoided similar problems in part because it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk"&gt;sourcing different semiconductors and rewriting software on the fly&lt;/a&gt; to make those chips work in place of the ones not currently available. Beyond that, the company continues to see strong sales in China, where it started making and selling vehicles in early 2020. The Model Y SUV has also become a popular option in the United States, and Tesla &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/23/tesla-tsla-starts-model-y-deliveries-europe/"&gt;just started selling them in Europe, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPVdxY"&gt;Even more production is set to come online in the coming months, too, as Tesla has built an enormous part of its factory in Austin, Texas and is finally making it through some of the last approvals to start operating its new plant outside Berlin, Germany. That’s despite delaying some products, like the Cybertruck and second-generation Roadster. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 seems okay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czowgV8suHZPSI1rQovgTmrYi_c=/8x0:2552x1696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69941409/twarren__windows11_sharper.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ReSjqZ"&gt;Microsoft’s next version of Windows, Windows 11, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;is coming October 5th&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways, it’s already here — the free update has been available for Windows Insiders to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22544024/windows-11-download-how-to-preview-microsoft"&gt;download and test&lt;/a&gt; for months, and recent versions like the Release Preview will likely be indistinguishable from the final operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5P92D7"&gt;We’ll have a full review from Tom Warren next week, but in the meanwhile we thought we’d give you a look at how &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; at large feels about upgrading to the new OS — by asking every other prominent Windows user on the team to install the most recent version on their own home computers, and gathering their impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cazXC"&gt;Here’s how it’s going so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0Ee63R"&gt;On a home-built desktop (Core i7-7700K, RTX 3060 Ti) and a 2017 Dell XPS 15 laptop (Core i7-7700HQ)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jYPqBL"&gt;Windows 11 insists my desktop’s 7th-gen Intel CPU isn’t good enough, despite having practically every feature (and quite a bit more performance) than the lowest end 8th-gen chips on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;compatibility list&lt;/a&gt;. But that didn’t stop me from installing a copy of Windows 11 right over my copy of Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindowsinsiderpreviewiso" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;by using the ISO image&lt;/a&gt; — I just needed to turn on my TPM module and enable Secure Boot in my motherboard’s BIOS, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686457/windows-11-health-check-compatible-supported-cpu-old-pc-waiver"&gt;click through a scary warning message&lt;/a&gt;. (Windows disqualified my 7th-gen laptop and forced me to do a clean install, though, so I did a dual-boot there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LO8z4"&gt;Since then, it’s been a practically painless upgrade. Almost everything was exactly where I left it, and almost everything works just the way I’d expect, including PC games. (Wallpaper Engine did forget how to load new wallpaper at first, and there were a few times my system failed to wake from sleep.) My XPS 15’s fingerprint reader and nose-hair webcam are still terrible, but they’re no worse than they were on Windows 10 — Windows 11 pulled down all the drivers I needed automatically once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQkirC"&gt;But nothing feels much &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, either, so I don’t see any reason to upgrade. HDR is still a mess, and I’m with Tom on the Windows 11 taskbar: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673266/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-features-missing-design-changes"&gt;it’s a giant step back&lt;/a&gt;. It’s annoying to have to launch an app before I can pin it to my taskbar, and annoying to have to manually toggle on every icon I want in my system tray. Why do I have to launch an entire new window to adjust the volume mixer? Is there a reason why my audio devices are in a different place? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lUYvw"&gt;But I haven’t found enough wrong with Windows 11 to bother uninstalling it and going back. — &lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hNktbB"&gt;On a 2019 Dell XPS 13 7390 laptop (Core i7-10710U)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XfApY3"&gt;I had a particularly bad time upgrading my last computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10 — I ended up having to wipe the system and start from scratch — so I was relieved and, to tell the truth, a little surprised at how smoothly this upgrade to Windows 11 went. Everything still works, and continues to work, so there’s no reason to do a panicked return to Windows 10. The only glitch I’ve experienced so far is that, just after upgrading, both the Chrome and the Edge browsers refused to show Facebook, but a reboot fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze3Sra"&gt;That being said, I am not thrilled with the new taskbar and Start menu. While I never got around to really customizing the Start menu &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673266/microsoft-windows-11-taskbar-features-missing-design-changes"&gt;the way Tom does&lt;/a&gt;, I did like the look of the tiles, and because I’m a rabid organizer, I really liked the way I could group the tiles to reflect the way I was working, and regroup them whenever I needed to for my current projects. This new taskbar, with its real lack of customization options, feels a little like Microsoft no longer trusts its users to be knowledgeable enough to handle a more complex menu system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9EY3K"&gt;I’m just starting to explore Windows 11, so it’s possible I’ll find more things to like or dislike. But so far, it’s working fine for me — I’m just not sure I like it better. — &lt;em&gt;Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hQ4Puw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10785368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vLdfWU"&gt;On a home-built desktop (Core i7-4770K, GTX 980 Ti)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4h9pK1"&gt;I jumped through many hoops to install Windows 11 on my very unsupported, pre-TPM, non-Secure Boot personal desktop. I built this machine in 2014, upgraded it to a 980 Ti in 2015, and it has been my sole everyday personal computer for gaming and photography ever since. It’s been a solid performer on Windows 10 all these years, still meeting or exceeding minimum requirements for the games I play — of which I ask no more than 60 fps at modest settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u09ytk"&gt;To get Windows 11 installed, I used a Windows 10 ISO that I modified using part of the Windows 11 ISO, essentially tricking Windows 10 into upgrading to 11. The OS thought it was running a Windows 10 update, up until a Windows 11 login screen suddenly appeared. It all felt a bit dicey and very nerve-wracking, but it worked! It didn’t even require a wipe or clean install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IApdGu"&gt;So how does Windows 11 run on a seven year-old unsupported machine after going through a process like that? Surprisingly, a whole lot like Windows 10. If you covered up the user interface changes and aligned the Start Menu on the left, I might have a hard time telling the difference. Lightroom Classic runs about as fine with my full frame camera RAW files as it normally does, which is just a notch or two above infuriating, but passable. &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; still runs at a solid 60 fps. &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2 Resurrected &lt;/em&gt;is usually between 55-60 fps with a mix of low and moderate settings. There were a few small hiccups here and there when I first booted up some of those games, but Windows 10 was not without the odd gremlin. Now that I got through that iffy update process, I can summarize my feelings toward Windows 11 with one big shruggie. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTPXgd"&gt;I don’t dislike it. I don’t love it either, but it looks kinda pretty. Sometimes a fresh coat of paint is all you need, annoying start menus and taskbars notwithstanding. — &lt;em&gt;Antonio G. Di Benedetto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WF288Q"&gt;On a home-built desktop (Core i5-9600K, RTX 2070)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QOfoxX"&gt;Okay, so I had a feeling that installing on my DIY PC was going to be a &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;. I failed the PC health checkup. “But doc! I feel fine,” I felt like my PC was saying. As if I had zero things to do on this particular day, I decided I’d try pretty much anything to get my PC to pass the test so it wouldn’t put up a fight during the installation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDNV6y"&gt;The big hurdle I (and my PC) had to overcome was converting the boot drive’s partition table type from MBR to GPT. Do I remember choosing MBR when I installed Windows 10? Not at all. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt"&gt;Microsoft made a handy MBR2GPT.exe tool&lt;/a&gt; that can execute within Command Prompt, swiftly doing the lord’s work to my SSD while I poke around online. It might work for you. It did not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awkfCV"&gt;I kept failing the disk validation. Over and over. Running out of options, I made a bootable USB drive with GParted on it, with the hopes that it can do what this other tool couldn’t, so I could get on with my day. But at this point, I had already grown impatient at how long this stupid process was taking. I’m the only one who uses my PC! I don’t really need Secure Boot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26lSMz"&gt;In my fervor for trying to wrap it up quickly, I, you know, deleted my entire OS. Of course there were important files on it. No, I don’t remember what they are just yet (and I hope to never remember so that I don’t feel regret for my impatience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URjIJ5"&gt;The good news, I guess, is that I have Windows 11 now. It’s fine, but I was content with the idea of using Windows 10 for the rest of my life. It ran well, and I just didn’t really think about what could be since it did everything I wanted it to. I guess I took it a little too seriously when Microsoft said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;Windows 10 was the last version of Windows&lt;/a&gt;. — &lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FImFH3"&gt;Since my Windows 10 install is filled to the brim with things that would be a pain to re-set up and various hacks that keep everything running, I decided not to risk anything and installed Windows 11 on a separate partition. Switching between them, I can say that Windows 11 looks much nicer to my eye — except for the fact that you can’t put the taskbar on the top, because Microsoft hates me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiPzVQ"&gt;I don’t have hours and hours of stability testing, but throughout the beta it’s been mostly fine except for one infuriating bug — if I plug or unplug my computer from power, it’ll freeze for a few seconds, and the screen will flash black a few times. This doesn’t happen in Windows 10, and it’s been a problem since I first installed the preview. I’ve also just recently started having issues with my LG UltraFine 5K as well. It’ll go black for a few seconds every minute or two, though Windows doesn’t seem to register that it’s dropped off. I get that it’s a Thunderbolt display mostly made for Macs, but these issues haven’t cropped up in Windows 10. Until they’re gone from my test install, I’d really rather not upgrade to Windows 11 on my main partition. Other than those issues, though, it’s been like using a prettier version of Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFDKGU"&gt;One last quick note though: one of the things I was most excited about for Windows 11 was &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/speed-up-your-dotnet-and-cplusplus-development-with-hot-reload-in-visual-studio-2022/"&gt;Visual Studio’s Hot Reload feature&lt;/a&gt;, where you’d be able to quickly test changes to your code without having to rebuild it. It turns out that I have it on Windows 10 now, and it hasn’t worked the few times I’ve tried to use it. Ah well. —&lt;em&gt; Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UoIX9i"&gt;On a 2015 Surface Pro 4 (Core i5, 4GB RAM)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KBzKaQ"&gt;My Windows 11 journey was a bumpy ride. I started out with an outdated Windows 10 preview build on my Surface Pro 4, which meant I couldn’t get Windows Update to check my device’s eligibility for Windows 11. My device is from 2015 so it’s definitely out of the 5-year scope that Windows recommends for Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HVX9f"&gt;Since I don’t have anything of value on this device, I decided to wipe this puppy with a clean install of the Windows 11 Release Preview. I downloaded the ISO from Microsoft, then used Rufus to format my USB drive and create the bootable USB. I plugged in the USB and my little machine did the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4nkbM"&gt;The most notable difference between Windows 10 and Windows 11 for the SP4: my touchscreen is quite laggy if not entirely useless, especially at start-up. I have to use my mouse and keyboard to navigate the login, when I usually can swipe up to enter my password (now my Windows Pin). While some of the new features like Windows Snap work well, I was disappointed (though not surprised) that my default web browser Firefox doesn’t support it yet. Also, where is my list of apps? — &lt;em&gt;Gloria Sin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sRnrOR"&gt;On an Alienware R10 (Ryzen 5600X, RTX 3070, 32GB RAM), a 2020 Dell XPS 13 (Core i7-1165G7, 16GB) and a 2015 XPS 13 (Core i5-5200U, 8GB)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UhiMGB"&gt;One of my machines is old enough that it originally shipped with Windows 8, and I was surprised to find it didn’t meet Microsoft’s minimum supported specs for Windows 11. It has Secure Boot and TPM 2.0, but the Core i5 CPU is a few generations too old for their liking. Despite that, performing a clean install was as easy as ever and it flew by without so much as a warning. Windows 11 performs just as well on that old laptop as Windows 10 ever did — and much better than Windows 8 — despite the limitations imposed by just 8GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUo1B4"&gt;On a more modern version of the same XPS 13, I never looked back after installing a beta version of Windows 11. Other than that minor snafu with the Start menu disappearing one night, it didn’t have any problems. On that machine more than any other I appreciate the various tweaks to the UI, it feels at home and performs like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91PeZj"&gt;On my desktop is where I ran into the biggest snag — Tom’s pet issue about the lack of clock display on all monitors — but also one of the most significant benefits. A new &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/apply-snap-layout-menu"&gt;Snap Layouts&lt;/a&gt; feature makes it much easier to align Tweetdeck, Chrome, and Slack on my main screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjpxO3"&gt;The only thing that made me regret upgrading wasn’t on these computers, and it’s not a problem with Windows 11. While trying to downgrade back to Windows 10 on a different computer I was giving to a friend, the installation process ran into a still-unfixed driver issue with the Windows 10 setup process and blue screened. If there’s a chance you might have to roll back, then don’t forget you’ll be doing it to an older/finickier OS, and one that annoyingly pops up Cortana for some reason. Otherwise, I didn’t see any problem with updating right away. — &lt;em&gt;Richard Lawler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xacmyM"&gt;On a home-built desktop (Ryzen 9 5900X, RTX 3090)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="htHXoZ"&gt;Compared to some of my colleagues’ tribulations, my process to upgrade to Windows 11 was mercifully simple. Outside of making sure that all my files were backed up on an external hard drive and then securely locked away in a shielded bunker and a certain amount of trepidation, everything from start to finish mostly went off without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNULoh"&gt;The now Cortana-less setup is definitely an improvement, but I’m still peeved by the amount of preferences and services I need to opt in/out of. C’mon Microsoft, if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a million times, stop trying to make OneDrive work for me, it’s not going to happen. I could understand this barrage of questions if I was performing a fresh installation, but if I’m upgrading, I would’ve expected it to remember my preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqaD7T"&gt;Once I’d finally gotten my preferences where I wanted them and booted up, the most apparent change was the default placement of the start menu. Having the little Windows icon in the center of the taskbar took a little getting used to, but after using it for a while, I can’t imagine putting it anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcRLpp"&gt;While I’m glad that the start menu is far less cluttered I wish Microsoft would give us more freedom to customize that space. Why let me get rid of the recommended tab if I can’t use that space for something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMI1sA"&gt;These are all minor quibbles of course, considering the hoops that some of my colleagues had to jump through. But all things considered, I’m glad I upgraded to Windows 11, and I’m happy with the direction Microsoft is taking. — &lt;em&gt;Alice Newcome-Beill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QwP1p0"&gt;On a home-built desktop (Ryzen 5 5600X, RTX 3080) and a Razer Blade 14 laptop (Ryzen 9 5900HX, RTX 3070)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9qr5wr"&gt;To be honest with you, I can’t tell you exactly why I upgraded. I use my desktop exclusively for gaming, and despite Microsoft’s insistence that Windows 11 is the best Windows yet for gaming… I’m not sure there’s a lot to back that claim up. But I upgraded anyways and, what’s this? A version of Windows that is maybe possibly actually &lt;em&gt;attractive&lt;/em&gt;? Sure, there are spots you can find that reveal a pre-glowup Windows (my favorite: somehow Windows Media Player was the default media player for MP4s? Woof, what an app) but overall, I can say that something about Windows 11 is just fundamentally more pleasing to be around. Having used Mac OS from ~2001 until 2017 every day, it has been hard for me to admit just how important that user environment was to my overall satisfaction using those computers for extended periods of time. But with Windows 11, Microsoft has made meaningful progress towards providing a desktop computing environment that appears to be designed by actual professionals. Kudos! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNGL28"&gt;And that was enough to convince me to install it on my new work laptop, which I spend &lt;em&gt;a lot more time with&lt;/em&gt;. In that environment, I pair it with a 32” external display. And while I’m not plugging and unplugging my laptop as much as I may have in the past (I don’t have anywhere to be anymore!) it has been an improvement to have apps return to their previous locations, for the most part. This is the dumbest, lowest-hanging fruit “feature” but Microsoft wasn’t too embarrassed to highlight it, so I’ll report back here: 36-year-old operating system developed by trillion dollar company does basic task sufficiently. Hurray? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2JAgp"&gt;One last observation: Microsoft, I do not want to use OneDrive or Teams. Seriously, cut it out, it’s weird. — &lt;em&gt;Chris Grant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tIvAmj"&gt;On a home-built desktop (Core i9-9900K, RTX 3080)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uGDyX2"&gt;Replacing Windows 10 with 11 felt like I’d gotten a brand new computer. Part of this may be because I had a new monitor — but it’s also the OS! It just feels cleaner and faster. There are still plenty of little quirks that irritate me. Menus that haven’t been updated, and others that seem to been annihilated entirely (I will miss you super detailed and super ugly and half hidden Power Management Menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJbC99"&gt;But ultimately it just feels like an upgrade. Maybe because &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; feels more stable on it then Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VryYY"&gt;But perhaps I can’t be trusted for an opinion on this. I like the Chromium-based Edge browser &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; enjoy the task bar being center stage. — &lt;em&gt;Alex Cranz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
