    <title>This leak shows that Sony’s noise-canceling earbuds could fit in your ears better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yp5Ak0u8iUrKXB94JkzGq_9PjxE=/0x54:1280x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856308/1000XM4.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8jFcLY"&gt;Sony’s upcoming WF-1000XM4 earbuds may have been shown off in a leak, with a slimmed-down design. &lt;a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/741/741151.htm"&gt;The leak from &lt;em&gt;MyDrivers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/sony-wf-1000xm4-design-leaked-wf-1000xm3-sucessor/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MySmartPrice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) claims to show the sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;Sony’s very good WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; — and if it’s real, it seems like a nice design upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj5iD7"&gt;The new purported design does away with the large, Popsicle-stick-like design that sticks out of the user’s ear, and instead goes with a more modern style of bud that fits in your ear — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="quR3nx"&gt;The leaked image shows a copper accent cylinder that acts as a design flair similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/walkman/nw-wm1a"&gt;its modern, high-end Walkmans&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll likely have to wait for an official announcement to find out its purpose — whether it’s a charging port, microphone array for active noise cancellation, or something else entirely. At the moment, though, I can’t help but hope that this leak is real, as these are a considerable improvement over the old model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Malaysian news site fined $124,000 for five reader comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MALAYSIA-MEDIA-COURT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_MtHIrbKpQ7wmmvqMyuP8tRgRQ=/4x0:4596x3061/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856120/1231247672.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WSaXE6"&gt;A Malaysian news site was fined the equivalent of nearly $124,000 for five comments below an article. News outlet &lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/malaysiakini/status/1362681271470551045"&gt;raised money&lt;/a&gt; to cover the fee of 500,000 ringgit, but human rights advocates say it was targeted for its reporting on government corruption, and they worry that the case could chill political speech online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hPpD5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/world/asia/malaysia-press-freedom-guilty.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the verdict on Friday, when a panel of judges found &lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; guilty of contempt of court. &lt;a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/532693"&gt;The outlet argued&lt;/a&gt; that it wasn’t responsible for reader comments, and it removed them after police warned that the comments illegally insulted Malaysia’s judiciary. But the court said it should have preemptively moderated the comments and never allowed them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knFm1b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malaysiakini&lt;/em&gt; is a prominent independent outlet, and it’s earned international accolades for its reporting over the past two decades. It’s faced &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54277437"&gt;periodic legal harassment&lt;/a&gt; within the country, though, culminating in the contempt of court charges that were filed last year. Co-founder Steven Gan also faced charges and a possible prison sentence. Gan’s situation was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/business/media/freedom-digital-news-sites-autocrats.html"&gt;compared to that&lt;/a&gt; of Filipino journalist Maria Ressa, whom authorities accused of “cyber libel” after her site &lt;em&gt;Rappler&lt;/em&gt; published critical reporting. But unlike Ressa, who was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/876943655/philippine-journalist-maria-ressa-found-guilty-of-violating-cyberlibel-law"&gt;convicted last year&lt;/a&gt;, Gan was acquitted of personal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAPEC6"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that this case was the first of its type brought against a news outlet in Malaysia, and Amnesty International Malaysia called it “a grave setback for freedom of expression in the country.” But Malaysia’s internet crackdown echoes an international push to make sites legally responsible for what users post — including in the United States, where lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;have taken aim&lt;/a&gt; at a rule offering blanket protection against liability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon rainforest fires got even worse last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BRAZIL-ENVIRONMENT-FIRE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYLmVJ6bQU_dSUIBJXJrXcX8G4k=/0x92:4494x3088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855922/1228063125.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smoke rises from an illegally lit fire in a section of Amazon rainforest, south of Novo Progresso in Pará state, Brazil, on August 15th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Carl de Souza / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q65FYa"&gt;Fires in the Amazon reached devastating new levels in 2020, new NASA satellite imagery shows. The space agency developed a &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147075/a-new-tool-for-tracking-amazon-fires"&gt;new tool&lt;/a&gt; to track fires from space after Brazil’s Amazon suffered a record-breaking year of fires in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELU7zn"&gt;Specialized sensors on satellites collect visible and infrared imagery, which NASA uses to detect thermal anomalies — basically hotspots caused by fire. Its satellites found 1.4 million of those anomalies in the Southern Amazon last year, compared to 1.1 million in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEyaq0"&gt;“Fire activity was up significantly in 2020,” Douglas Morton, chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147946/fires-raged-in-the-amazon-again-in-2020"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; today. “All types of fires contributed to the increase, including deforestation fires and understory fires, the most environmentally destructive types.” The effects of these kinds of fires can last for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWe3R_naXe3El1DwG64x0JGWYF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320513/amazonburnedwide_vir_2020_lrg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA grouped fires into four different types marked on this map: fires caused by deforestation to make way for industry (red), uncontrolled fires that burn the understory of the forest (green), fires burning in savanna-grasslands (blue), and small fires set by subsistence farmers to clear land (purple). NASA looks at the duration, intensity, and movement of fire “hotspots” to identify what kind of fire is burning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZG6JT8"&gt;Fires caused by deforestation were up 23 percent in 2020 compared to the year before. These blazes are started intentionally to clear parts of the rainforest to make room for cattle ranching and farming. This was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836891/amazon-fires-brazil-bolsonaro-rainforest-deforestation-analysis-effects"&gt;the main culprit behind catastrophic fires in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when deforestation in the country hit an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-deforestation/brazil-amazon-rainforest-deforestation-hits-11-year-high-in-2019-government-data-idUSKBN1XS1PK"&gt;11-year high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1HOck"&gt;There was a steep 60 percent rise in the most destructive kind of fire: uncontrolled understory fires that spread from a blaze that might have been intentionally set. Large fires aren’t natural in the Amazon’s wet terrain. In a typical year, fires are primarily the result of people setting chopped-down, dried-out trees aflame. But this year, drier conditions in the southeastern Amazon made it easier for human-made blazes to escape into parts of the rainforest that hadn’t been cleared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdnkI1"&gt;“As a result, the scale of the fires in this area was extraordinary and devastating,” Morton said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Clearing the rainforest to make way for ranches and agriculture is a process that can take several years of logging and burning." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QypQYW_POMGOj5IGXpkD3geKSdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320532/deforestationtimeseries_2013_2018.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clearing the rainforest to make way for ranches and agriculture is a process that can take several years of logging and burning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw3A8f"&gt;The numbers are even more alarming considering how bad 2019 already was. That year, Brazil suffered a more than &lt;a href="http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/portal-static/situacao-atual/"&gt;80 percent jump&lt;/a&gt; in the number of fires compared to 2018, according to the country’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Since entering office in 2019, Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has worked to &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20210123-brazil-indigenous-leaders-sue-bolsonaro-for-killings-and-ecological-destruction"&gt;open up the Amazon to more development and set aside less land for Indigenous tribes&lt;/a&gt; and conservation efforts. NASA found that &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/amazon-deforestation-falls-where-land-is-under-indigenous-control/"&gt;Indigenous territories saw fewer fires&lt;/a&gt; compared to other lands without protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfpSOO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elRI7X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Crew Dragon performing ‘beautifully’ on ISS as NASA eyes a backup ride</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dXqrkXmF6TRzYBtEoUh8JZZ6zDY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855875/50953553088_6da480ba2a_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Russia’s Progress 77 cargo resupply ship is seen approaching the International Space Station through the window of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. | NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kmtr2l"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon astronaut taxi is doing “beautifully” so far in its first operational, long-duration stay on the International Space Station, NASA’s human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The capsule, named Resilience, sent three NASA astronauts and a Japanese astronaut to the station last November, and a trivial housekeeping task is the only unexpected hiccup faced by the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BG68Yx"&gt;“We’ve been very, very happy with how things are going,” Lueders said in an interview. “The only minor thing we had was we’re getting some little bits of lint on the seal” where Crew Dragon connects to the ISS, she added. Astronauts have been floating in and out of the spacecraft for months, leaving behind a buildup of lint and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KN73np"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I can handle having housekeeping issues”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dGEtvw"&gt;SpaceX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21565237/spacex-crew-1-dragon-launch-success-falcon-9-nasa"&gt;launched the Crew-1 mission&lt;/a&gt; on November 15th carrying Commander Mike Hopkins, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Shannon Walker and Soichi Noguchi, a Japanese astronaut. The mission marked SpaceX’s first fully operational mission under its NASA contract after nailing its final test milestone last summer with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21350663/nasa-spacex-crew-dragon-astronauts-bob-behnken-doug-hurley-splash-down"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; of two US astronauts, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOnig4"&gt;Some extra dust is definitely not the worst problem NASA and SpaceX could face on a $100 billion orbital laboratory that has housed astronauts in low Earth orbit for over 20 years. “I can handle having housekeeping issues,” Lueders said. Astronauts have been using a vacuum to suck out all the lint, but for a longer-term fix to the pileup, a tiny cover was trucked to the station on the NG-15 cargo resupply mission, launched Saturday by Northrop Grumman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2uWXR"&gt;NASA and SpaceX have been closely monitoring Crew Dragon’s health in space as it tallies 98 days docked to the ISS — the longest duration for a human-rated US spacecraft. Perhaps most intimately familiar with the capsule is Hopkins, who’s been using Crew Dragon as his bunking quarters while others sleep elsewhere on the station. (Lueders made clear that Hopkins wasn’t solely to blame for all the dust — “don’t make me get in trouble with Mike Hopkins, Joey!”)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCFWc33GxPo7FEAmHiLj3E61dMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320567/50902727167_f0845a77a0_k.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon “Resilience” spacecraft is seen docked to the International Space Station’s Harmony module.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6MpT8X"&gt;SpaceX’s next mission, Crew-2, is slated for April 20th, reusing the capsule that flew Behnken and Hurley for the DM-2 mission. NASA decided to allow SpaceX to reuse its capsules for astronaut flights last year, setting the stage for a rigorous refurbishment and certification process for SpaceX. It’s similar to what the agency will go through with Boeing’s Starliner, Crew Dragon’s rival capsule that’s still in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FXZhRy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;refurbishing astronaut capsules in “dragonland”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KJsqn"&gt;That refurb process will take place in Florida, where the company used to refurbish its old Cargo Dragon vehicles. Lueders said SpaceX engineers call their Kennedy Space Center refurbishment facilities “Dragonland.” SpaceX has already added infrastructure for Crew Dragon refurbishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1ynJLC"&gt;NASA still needs a backup seat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lmC4dj"&gt;Even though Crew Dragon Resilience is doing well on the ISS, and the upcoming Crew-2 launch is on schedule for April, NASA still wants to have a backup plan. The station’s other three crew members are two Russian cosmonauts and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, who are due to return to Earth in April on the same Soyuz capsule they rode in on last year. If the Crew-2 spacecraft runs into problems before its April flight, NASA will need another option to get an astronaut to the ISS. Otherwise, they risk leaving the station with no NASA crew members for the first time since the station was first occupied in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIlfIT"&gt;The agency announced earlier this month that it’s seeking another seat on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft as a safety net. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278958/nasa-axiom-soyuz-russian-commercial-crew-spacex"&gt;NASA was in talks with space infrastructure startup Axiom Space&lt;/a&gt; to book that Soyuz seat, instead of buying directly from the Russians — only the second time in the decades-long NASA-Russia relationship to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaoAm9"&gt;Lueders said the US company (without specifically naming Axiom, because the talks were ongoing) reached out to NASA with its own proposal and offered the backup solution. So, as a legal formality, NASA issued a notice saying it’s looking to buy a Soyuz seat because — as Lueders put it — “one of our commercial providers out there said ‘Hey, there’s a commercial opportunity for me here,’ so they gave us an unsolicited proposal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEJ5LY"&gt;Axiom’s chief executive, Michael Suffredini, co-founded the Houston-based company in 2016 after spending 10 years as NASA’s ISS program manager. It’s unclear whether Axiom had already owned the Soyuz seat it’s selling to NASA or whether the Houston-based company is currently going through the process with Roscosmos to buy it. Roscosmos (Russia’s space agency) and Axiom both declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHhzjO"&gt;No matter the arrangement, the dealmaking and seat swapping is poised to give NASA the assurance it needs to keep a US astronaut on the ISS. NASA and the State Department are “in the final stages” of coming up with an agreement with Roscosmos to fly Russian cosmonauts on future flights of SpaceX’s or Boeing’s capsules in exchange for flying more US astronauts on Soyuz spacecraft, Lueders said. Nailing that agreement has been a yearslong process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qckd5"&gt;“We were hoping it would happen a little bit sooner, and so unfortunately it wasn’t happening in time for the April Soyuz seat,” Lueders said. That delay gave Axiom a chance to make a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNaHHI"&gt;“If you said, ‘Kathy, what’s your logistics dream?’ I would say every vehicle going up to the ISS needs to have a US crew member on it, and we believe every US vehicle going up to have a Russian crew member on it,” Lueders said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys04Dc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction February 22, 1:20PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated a cargo version of Crew Dragon that launched in January was the same spacecraft used in a previous uncrewed test mission, DM-1. The DM-1 spacecraft was destroyed in a testing explosion in 2019, and the cargo Crew Dragon was a new vehicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen are now co-hosts of a Spotify-exclusive podcast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qU4_UVGSegGnc_KbiaqewgGLVJk=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855787/_SNY2355.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZxhDp8"&gt;Barack Obama is getting into the podcast game. Today, Spotify announced that the former president and rockstar Bruce Springsteen — yes, you read that right — will host a show called &lt;em&gt;Renegades: Born in the USA&lt;/em&gt; exclusively for the audio platform. They’ll discuss “race, fatherhood, marriage, and the state of America,” per a press release, and the first two episodes premiere today for both free and premium Spotify users. The first season will contain eight episodes total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49JvfQ"&gt;Higher Ground, the production company owned by Michelle and Barack Obama, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655475/spotify-signs-podcast-deal-with-the-obamas-production-company"&gt;signed a deal&lt;/a&gt; with Spotify in 2019, committing themselves to creating exclusive podcasts for the platform. &lt;em&gt;Renegades&lt;/em&gt; is the second of those shows. &lt;em&gt;The Michelle Obama Podcast&lt;/em&gt; debuted this past summer on Spotify and was later made available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494284/spotify-michelle-obama-podcast-release-exclusive"&gt;across platforms&lt;/a&gt;, including Apple Podcasts. Spotify has said the show was the biggest Spotify Original show “in history,” but it hasn’t shared specific numbers. Presumably, this show will be just as big, if not bigger, giving Spotify even more of a chance to bring people over to its platform for podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile just brought back a true unlimited data plan with 5G and no throttling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDgbCAqNAIeyRHBvOHBQ-5Kz3W4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855699/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDBh15"&gt;T-Mobile has just announced a new monthly phone plan called Magenta Max that the company says is designed for the era of 5G. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fstories%2Fmagenta-max&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295466%2Ft-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to this press release&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile claims Magenta Max is “the first and only 5G consumer smartphone plan that can’t slow you down based on how much data you use.” That makes it sound like the carrier is doing away with what’s known as deprioritization, where your speeds are subject to slowdown after you exceed a certain amount of data in a billing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuw1DY"&gt;“T-Mobile has lit up the highest-capacity 5G network available — a network so powerful it can start unleashing the power of 5G to deliver unlimited premium data,” the company said.  Magenta Max promises “unlimited 4K UHD” video streaming compared to the DVD-quality (or 1080p at best) limit that comes with many unlimited plans. T-Mobile is also extending the company’s “Netflix on Us” promotion to single-line customers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0-wI8Q_HvbP_ntwWv_Xf5KfwWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320564/max.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95rEr5"&gt;Magenta Max takes the place of the previous Magenta Plus plan and will be available starting on February 24th. It includes 40GB of high-speed tethering data, plus the usual T-Mobile perks like free in-flight Wi-Fi from Gogo, extensive international coverage, and Scam Shield protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KPA93Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VA4WAj"&gt;T-Mobile says pricing is “$57 per line per month for three lines with autopay and monthly taxes and fees included.” For a limited time, that’s dropped to $47 per line per month for three lines. Single-line customers will have to pay more at $85 per month with autopay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWVMpe"&gt;A lot of this has a “too good to be true” sound to it, so I’m also on the lookout for any asterisks or limits that T-Mobile isn’t talking about on the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fInXA9"&gt;Alongside Magenta Max, T-Mobile is also making changes to the core Magenta plan. It’s bumping up the monthly deprioritization ceiling to 100GB from the 50GB it’s at currently. Customers will also get more high-speed tethering data: it’s now 5GB compared to 3GB before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Avengers: Endgame directors’ production company signs overall deal with Spotify </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dOcN_Amil1APhrcja3SBd4YU48g=/151x0:1747x1064/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855433/Screen_Shot_2021_02_22_at_9.00.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4vH7qy"&gt;Anthony and Joe Russo’s AGBO production company is entering the audio space in a new multiyear deal with Spotify, following its massive success with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526664/netflix-movies-billion-dollar-box-office-blockbuster-ted-sarandos-earnings"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extraction &lt;/em&gt;on Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and the upcoming Tom Holland-led feature &lt;a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/cherry/umc.cmc.40gvwq6hnbilmnxuutvmejx4r?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000&amp;amp;itscg=MC_20000&amp;amp;itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;amp;mttn3pid=a_google_adwords&amp;amp;mttnagencyid=1625&amp;amp;mttncc=US&amp;amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019895_1-491374017553-c&amp;amp;mttnsubkw=120033862727_kwd-330092397590_CJq46RN4_&amp;amp;mttnsubplmnt="&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cherry &lt;/em&gt;on Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejR8Kn"&gt;The directors, best known for their work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as sitcoms like &lt;em&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/em&gt;, will produce several series for Spotify. The move comes at a time when Spotify is trying to assert itself as the dominant podcast platform. With the Russo brothers, known for their specific type of blockbuster storytelling, the company is looking “to tell more stories that have the power to span generations and territories.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liM9CW"&gt;Spotify has signed other deals with storytellers and celebrities in recent months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453026/spotify-chernin-entertainment-partnership-first-look-podcast-ip"&gt;Chernin Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-01-21/spotify-and-ava-duvernays-array-partner-to-produce-scripted-and-unscripted-podcasts/"&gt;Ava DuVernay&lt;/a&gt;, and, most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; have all signed deals with Spotify to produce exclusive content for the platform. While many people may still use Spotify as a music-only platform, the company hasn’t hidden its ambitious podcasting goals, where executives are hoping to boost subscriber numbers and advertising revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWB8KG"&gt;Spotify hasn’t announced if the Russo brothers are already working on their first series for Spotify or if everything is still in early stages of development at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC Comics is launching a podcast universe on Spotify </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6EQPKEJ5AiwmoCoPhucDFWd0BM=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855429/dc_spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdIQYp"&gt;DC is launching another universe to tell its superhero stories — but this time, it’s not on HBO Max or Cartoon Network: it’s on Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eei277"&gt;The publisher is working on nine shows for Spotify, including shows about Catwoman, Wonder Woman, the Riddler, Batgirl, Superman and Lois Lane, and more — although DC creative director Jim Lee didn’t give too much more information about what those shows entail right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqAYHQ"&gt;Spotify and DC Comics signed a podcasting deal last June. The multiseries, multiyear deal was part of a bigger partnership between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294489/spotify-dc-comics-podcast-exclusive-deal"&gt;Spotify and DC Comics’ parent company&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia. The first project out of the partnership is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493298/spotify-dc-comics-batman-podcast-bruce-wayne-premiere"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman Unburied&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will explore the “darker aspects of Bruce Wayne’s psychology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGflmD"&gt;Competition within the podcasting space has heated up over the last few years. DC Comics’ biggest competitor, Marvel, &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/podcasts/marvel-entertainment-and-siriusxm-enter-a-major-multi-year-deal-to-create-original-podcasts-for-siriusxm-and-pandora"&gt;has its own podcasting deal&lt;/a&gt; with Pandora. The company also has a deal with podcasting platform Stitcher for several series. Both Pandora and Stitcher are owned by SiriusXM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uECgKl"&gt;It’s a good time for all three companies, as there’s more superhero content than ever before and interest from millions of people to find and devour new content. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202992/dc-films-multiverse-batman-wonder-woman-aquaman-hbo-max-dceu-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;shows like &lt;em&gt;GCPD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pacemaker &lt;/em&gt;coming to HBO Max (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;spinoffs of &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;), it’s a perfect opportunity to have content, well, everywhere. (Not to mention &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League &lt;/em&gt;is just around the corner.) For example, Jeffrey Wright will take on a role in a DC Comics &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jeffrey-wright-starring-in-batman-podcast-from-hbo-max-exclusive"&gt;podcast show for Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, but he’s also Detective Jim Gordon in &lt;em&gt;The Batman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jy7XVH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify HiFi is a lossless streaming tier coming later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dRpWCiVtheHUbyN9uvHc4w3pjOU=/158x0:1835x1118/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855332/Screen_Shot_2021_02_22_at_11.29.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1sCH4"&gt;Spotify is going hi-fi. Well, “HiFi.” It’s taken longer than competitors like Tidal and Amazon Music, but today, the leading subscription music service announced a new lossless streaming tier that will allow listeners to get the most from their digital music library. The news came at the company’s Spotify “Stream On” virtual event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCiu0i"&gt;Spotify HiFi will be available later this year and “will deliver music in CD-quality, lossless audio format to your device and Spotify Connect-enabled speakers, which means fans will be able to experience more depth and clarity while enjoying their favorite tracks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Ubjjf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W07MvWbuWkI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvJorF"&gt;Spotify has done small tests of higher-quality streaming in the past, but now it’s going to launch the feature more widely — with the caveat that it’ll be available only “in select markets.” Pricing is yet to be announced. Higher-quality streaming has apparently been among the top requests from its customers; as it stands today, Spotify tops out at 320kbps audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHW4MD"&gt;Amazon rolled out Amazon Music HD &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20869526/amazon-music-hd-lossless-flac-tier-spotify-apple"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The lossless plan costs $14.99 per month (or $12.99 for Prime customers), a premium over the standard Amazon Music Unlimited service. Tidal, which has supported high-resolution audio since its very beginning, is priced slightly higher at $19.99 monthly for the “Hi-Fi” plan. Tidal offers what it calls “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2Fmasters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295273%2Fspotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal Masters&lt;/a&gt;” that can even exceed high-resolution 96 kHz / 24 bit audio. Smaller services like Qobuz have also sought to appeal to audiophiles with lossless streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pheala"&gt;Apple Music, on the other hand, still lacks any kind of lossless streaming tier, despite Apple selling the very high-end AirPods Max headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ACCGYzU2wR3-6BaupyrR4XrSoRA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68855298/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In the US, 5G remains a work in progress, despite carriers waving “5G Mission Accomplished” banners for years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The fourth industrial revolution will not be televised&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2rF2Fy"&gt;After an introduction from Consumer Technology Association president Gary Shapiro, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg takes the stage. He wears a simple black T-shirt with an unmistakable red check and begins delivering his keynote speech. The topic at hand is 5G, something Vestberg speaks about enthusiastically. The keynote covers the eight “currencies” of 5G, features a professional athlete, and highlights how 5G will transform the drone industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPtmvC"&gt;That was CES 2019. It was also CES 2021. Verizon hasn’t been alone in fueling the 5G hype machine; AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile have been talking up their 5G networks for years. Now, it’s showtime. With major flagship phones and a lot more budget devices supporting it, this is the year when a critical mass of phone buyers will finally see for themselves what all this talk is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaXFel"&gt;Here’s the bad news: if they’ve been listening to the hype, they’re going to be disappointed. We’ve been promised a fourth industrial revolution with fantastical things like remote surgery and driverless cars. Instead, what we have now is widespread 5G that’s more or less the same speed as (or even slower than) 4G and super-fast mmWave 5G in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; parts of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; major cities with highly limited range. So where is this 5G future we’ve been promised? The truth is that it’s coming along, but it will materialize more slowly and in less obvious ways than what we’ve been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uEFYKL"&gt;Spectrum wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dzciVm"&gt;To understand the complicated 5G situation in the US right now, you first need to know that there are low-, mid-, and high-band frequencies that carriers can use. Low-band is slower but offers widespread coverage. High-band, often called mmWave, is very fast but extremely limited in range. Mid-band sits in a sweet spot between the two, with good range and better-than-LTE speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXZ3ph"&gt;If you were building a 5G network from scratch, you’d probably want a bunch of mid-band spectrum, right? The trouble is, spectrum is a limited resource. &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/authors/sascha-segan"&gt;Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;, lead mobile analyst at &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; and a wealth of 5G knowledge, sums up part of the spectrum problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjjNjv"&gt;“Our government did not make the right channels available to the carriers,” he says. “Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have basically just been using leftover odds and ends of their 4G spectrum... putting the 5G encoding on these leftover bits and bobs so they can pop a 5G icon on the screen. And the performance is meaningless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hRkK5K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s kind of like having that super fast sports car and you’re stuck on the Santa Monica freeway.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xixtRf"&gt;The technology Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are using to get nationwide 5G coverage is called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), which allows 4G and 5G to coexist on the same spectrum. That helps carriers make the transition from one technology to the other, but it comes at a cost. Michael Thelander, president and founder of wireless industry research firm &lt;a href="https://signalsresearch.com/"&gt;Signals Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, sums it up this way: “It’s kind of like having that super fast sports car and you’re stuck on the Santa Monica freeway. You can’t experience the full capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sv52l"&gt;T-Mobile, on the other hand, doesn’t need to rely on spectrum sharing as much as the other two, thanks to its acquisition of Sprint and its mid-band spectrum. That has given it an edge in its 5G offerings thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD5bmM"&gt;By early 2022, though, we will likely see Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T catching up. A swath of mid-band spectrum known as C-band went up for auction in late 2020. And while we don’t know which companies won which blocks of spectrum, we know those two carriers, in particular, spent big; bidding &lt;a href="https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107"&gt;topped out at over $80 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uw17dY"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VsP8hz"&gt;The networks might not be firing on all cylinders yet, but more and more mobile devices are ready for them. In fact, by the end of the year, it may be harder to find a non-5G phone than one that supports the technology. Not only do Apple and Samsung’s flagship phones support 5G across their lineups, but it’s also making its way into more midrange and budget devices, thanks to new 5G-ready low-end processors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiBmo5"&gt;More people than ever will buy a 5G phone this year — likely not because they really wanted 5G, but because the phone they were going to get anyway supports it. The good news is that there really isn’t a downside to buying a 5G phone now if it’s time to upgrade. The “5G tax” that put a higher price tag on 5G phones over the past couple of years seems to be disappearing, and we haven’t noticed any other drawbacks like excessive battery drain in our testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 series includes 5G connectivity across the lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sPWa6a"&gt;So what’s the reaction like so far from, say, someone who bought an iPhone 12 — not for 5G, but because it’s the new iPhone? “They’re frustrated and angry,” says Segan. “With both Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, because of what I’ll call technical difficulties, their nationwide 5G is often slower than their 4G. So people are getting these iPhones and they’re finding that frequently they have worse performance than they had before 5G.” The “technical difficulties” he refers to include DSS in Verizon’s case and the limitations of the narrow 5MHz band that AT&amp;amp;T often uses for its 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5fWGR"&gt;That’s not great. But a couple of factors will make a difference over the next year. First, that C-band spectrum will start coming online around the end of the year. If you’re one of the frustrated owners of an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21, there’s good news: your phone is already approved to use C-band, so if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T, you should see speed improvements when that happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u7PitC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re finding that frequently they have worse performance than they had before 5G”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MvPKH7"&gt;Not all 5G phones support C-band, though. Those that don’t will need a software update to use it, and there’s no guarantee that your phone’s manufacturer will offer one. Inexpensive 5G models, in particular, may not see a C-band update, even if they have the hardware to support it. Phone makers need to apply for Federal Communications Commission approval to enable it and may be less likely to bother with the cost of this step for phones with a shorter lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFIJxS"&gt;The other factor is something that will likely happen sooner than C-band becoming available: large gatherings. That’s when Segan thinks Verizon’s Ultra Wideband could really shine. “When we’re all vaccinated, I think people are going to be desperate... for all of these dense, crowded, communal experiences that we will have been missing for a year and a half. And so Verizon should be working on applications and experiences right now like the thing they did at the Super Bowl, or what they’ve talked about doing at Disney World, that you can only do on Ultra Wideband.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4L8b2T"&gt;Again, that will depend on your 5G phone supporting the right &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of 5G — not every 5G phone supports mmWave. The aforementioned iPhone and Samsung flagships do, and other Verizon models that support are denoted as “UW.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oDOGa4"&gt;Where are our jetpacks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ftsEj7"&gt;And what about the stuff of CES keynotes like remote surgery and self-driving cars? That’s on the way, too, but it’ll take longer. Thelander explains: “The first focus of 5G was really a feature called ‘enhanced mobile broadband’ and that’s just getting fast data speeds to the consumer on their smartphone. Things like factory automation and the functionality behind that, that was really developed afterwards, so it lags, from a standardization perspective.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TCL 10 5G UW" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-45gdo6AJkDTvjeyQhEZkf3YK80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990050/cfaulkner_201023_4258_0009.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first focus of 5G has been to boost mobile data speeds for consumers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uvow5O"&gt;Getting the technology piece sorted out is only half of the equation. “Once you’ve got a certain feature or functionality defined in a standard, now a vendor has to go out and build that functionality, then you have to test it, and then you have to have the industry adopt it,” Thelander says. “The technology may be there, the standard may be there, it may work fine, but it has to be implemented and rolled out. And you have to have the business case for it. How do you make money off of it? All those types of things… it just takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SQZrz1"&gt;Despite networks constantly waving their “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mission-accomplished"&gt;5G Mission Accomplished&lt;/a&gt;” banners in TV commercials over the past year, 5G is very much still a work in progress. It’s going to get better, but how soon that happens for you depends on a lot of factors: which phone you have and what bands it supports, which network you’re on, where you are, and what you’re doing. It seems clear now that there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte"&gt;never really was a “Race to 5G”&lt;/a&gt; — just technological progress as usual, which is often slow, confusing, and uneven. That’s a little bit harder to sell in a keynote or a commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
