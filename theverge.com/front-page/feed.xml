    <title>Sonos partners with Audi to bring its audio tech to cars</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOuxWq"&gt;Sonos has partnered with Audi to equip the automaker’s Q4 E-Tron with sound, a first for the California-based audio company best known for home speakers. The news was confirmed Tuesday by Sonos CEO Patrick Spence after Audi published images of the Q4 E-Tron’s interior showing the Sonos logo. &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/sonos-audi-partnership"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt; the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYh0Qf"&gt;On Tuesday, Audi published a trove of shots showing off the interior of its next EV, the Q4 E-Tron. While the German carmaker emphasized its new augmented reality heads-up display, others took note of the Sonos logo, despite no mention of the collaboration in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7WIM8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10383842"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FgAIc"&gt;“We want to be in all the different categories of audio, and a big chunk of that is in auto,” said Spence during the Q&amp;amp;A of a &lt;a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2021/Sonos-Investor-Event/"&gt;scheduled investor event&lt;/a&gt;. “Our first partnership of bringing our sound experience to automobiles is with Audi.” The Sonos CEO and former RIM executive said that more details of the Audi partnership will be shared “shortly,” presumably at the Q4 E-Tron launch event in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK99w4"&gt;With the announcement, Sonos joins a long list of audio companies that have made the jump to autos, including Bose, Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins, and Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen. The partnerships are seen as a way for home audio companies to diversify revenue sources, and for automakers to use brands known for premium audio to sway your buying decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKrUey"&gt;The news follows the Tuesday launch of Sonos’ most portable speaker to date, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319251/sonos-roam-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;$169 Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;. Sonos is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office"&gt;rumored to be working on headphones&lt;/a&gt; as the company broadens its focus from whole-home audio to providing sound anywhere you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYe1se"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has 18GB of RAM and a rear-facing OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xU7BKq-g8xVhFCvkMdSg7K2Fa6Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940445/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7O1TxR"&gt;Asus is going big with its latest gaming phones. The ROG Phone 5 lineup will start shipping this month across the globe, costing 799 euros (around $950) for the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage. Every configuration has a 6.78-inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 300Hz touch sampling rate. Also, the headphone jack has made a comeback after being absent from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a quad DAC in tow for hi-res audio. (In case you’re wondering where the ROG Phone 4 went, Asus skipped over the number four, like OnePlus did, due to its similarities with the word “death” in some Asian languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hemsoR"&gt;The most notable changes from the last generation are exclusive to some even more expensive configurations, the ROG Phone 5 Pro and Ultimate (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;which I published a review of&lt;/a&gt;) that release in April for 1,199 euros (approximately $1,420) and in May for 1,299 euros (about $1,583), respectively. Both of these models have double the storage and more RAM (starting at 16GB in the Pro and going all the way up to 18GB in the Ultimate); come in limited edition colors; and have two additional ultrasonic touch sensors than the standard model, located near where your ring fingers might rest while holding the phone in landscape mode. You’ll also get a case and a clip-on AeroActive Cooler 5 fan attachment with purchase with either the Pro or Ultimate phone (which adds two more buttons attached to the fan.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IG0kJe"&gt;The new Asus gaming phones aren’t huge departures from their predecessors, though the hardware and software are more refined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;I reviewed the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, and while it delivers on its promises to be a spec and feature juggernaut in some clever ways, paying $1,580 for it seems steep. Even the $950 base configuration isn’t what I’d consider affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMz3EQ"&gt;The Ultimate and Pro include “ROG Vision,” a feature that pushes premade or custom text or graphics to its rear-facing OLED screen. It’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, allowing you to personalize your phone if you want. The standard ROG Phone 5 simply has a backlit ROG logo, which some might find to be just enough pizazz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0hESauBGwuXXO05RRb5bE2v-xY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354178/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00012.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pIhpxO"&gt;I go into all of the features in the review. But if you’re just passing by and want to know all about the specs, I’ve attached a handy table just for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate review: overkill</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a mystifying phone with a steep price tag&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FWmeum"&gt;It’s reductive to refer to the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate as &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;a phone, even if it is one. Sure, it runs Android 11, and it can take calls, snap pictures, and do all of the other stuff every other phone can do. But if its edgy looks and tiny monochromatic OLED screen mounted on its back didn’t already give it away, this phone is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm7OXX"&gt;This is Asus’ latest attempt (technically its fourth, but it’s skipping that number in the name for superstitious reasons) at building a console-like experience into a phone for a niche but thriving global crowd of mobile gamers. It offers more power and customization than other large-screened phones, both in terms of hardware and software. It’s a real spec sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5c0Dw"&gt;For example, it has multiple USB-C ports to let you charge it in either landscape or portrait mode. This model also includes a snap-on fan cooler (its sole job is to keep the phone from overheating when you overclock it), and the fan packs USB-C passthrough charging, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and two remappable trigger buttons. In addition to that, there are some ultrasonic sensors around the phone that can replace some touch controls to make games feel more like you’re using a controller. And for this year’s model, its Armoury Crate app can boost its processor and graphics speed, increase the screen’s refresh rate, and more on a per-game basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BL7tXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10382537"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XsosXV"&gt;The Ultimate is Asus’ highest-end ROG Phone 5 coming in May for 1,299 euros (which is around $1,583). But other less expensive options will ship before then, starting in March for around $950. How does Asus justify the $600 price delta? This is the only configuration that has a matte white colorway with a few blue details sprinkled around the phone. And it’s the only one in the lineup — and perhaps the only phone other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;RedMagic’s new 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; — that has 18GB of RAM. It’s an impressive spec to find in a phone, but I’m still searching for a use case that requires having this much RAM. The cheaper versions of the ROG Phone 5 ship with 16GB and 12GB of RAM, respectively, which I’m betting doesn’t make a huge difference in performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l1DHHm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10382540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rG56aG"&gt;The Ultimate, in particular, seems to be made for only the most diehard of ROG fans. The phone comes with a laptop-sized box filled with a ROG-themed ball cap, towel, face covering, stickers, and more goodies. Aside from the aforementioned specs, the ever-so-slightly less expensive (but still around $1,420) ROG Phone 5 Pro, coming in April 2021, is very similar to the Ultimate. Both phones include two additional ultrasonic sensors on their backs near where your ring fingers might rest while holding them in landscape mode, as well as the rear-facing OLED screen I mentioned earlier called “ROG Vision.” It’s a thumb drive-sized display that’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, possibly attracting even more eyeballs at this bizarre-looking phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8BuFXAogjiciePCr5tO1d9IoN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357615/mask_up.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t really think of what else to do with ROG Vision, so I made a PSA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxl0z"&gt;Asus provides preloaded messages and graphics to use for the display that are situational depending on whether you’re gaming, charging the phone, or getting a call on your phone, to name a few, but you can crop your own images to fit within the display, as I did. Anything from a scrolling message with emoji to an image will work, and you can customize it further with an animation, like a static fade or fireworks. It’s like a souped-up version of the LEDs that companies put on the outside of flip phones, or even on Samsung’s Z Flip. The standard ROG Phone 5 has an RGB-backlit ROG logo instead. Some might actually prefer that to having the extra screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jUs82o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10382527"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9KsE5"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a better gaming phone than its predecessors, as well as the competing devices I’ve tried so far from Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Black Shark&lt;/a&gt;. For one, it’s the most powerful option out there with the Snapdragon 888 processor and its 18GB of RAM. Every device in the lineup starts with 512GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage, so it flies with opening apps, switching between them, and for other tasks that access storage. Its 6.78-inch FHD+ (2448 x 1080) OLED screen is one of the best I’ve ever used, even if it’s far too large to be my ideal size. Asus kept the 144Hz refresh rate (which automatically adjusts per app for efficiency by default) from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, but its touch latency is down to 24 milliseconds here with a 300Hz touch sampling rate, meaning it checks 300 times per second to see where you’ve touched it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063061/oneplus-8-120-hz-high-refresh-rate-screen-pete-lau"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro has a 240Hz sampling rate&lt;/a&gt;, for context. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;The new RedMagic 6&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to be far more affordable than the base ROG Phone 5 configuration uses similar display tech, but with a faster 165Hz refresh rate and a faster 500Hz touch sampling rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veyvt9"&gt;The specs and display used in each ROG Phone 5 make playing games look sharp and run smoothly, and some other features elevate the experience further, whether you’re gaming or watching movies. I particularly love the dual front-facing speakers. They offer the best stereo separation I’ve heard from a phone — to the point where, in most situations, I’m just as pleased to listen to audio aloud at home as I am through headphones. Speaking of, this year’s device sees the return of a 3.5mm audio jack that was missing from the 2020 ROG Phone 3. Asus brought it back with a vengeance, too, equipped with an ESS ES9280AC Pro quad DAC for hi-res audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joa1UySTEX9Ia-WFeaS_O8GGpDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357064/gamegenie.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Game Genie overlay offers instant access to system info and settings with a swipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TSpkT"&gt;Asus has spent the year refining its Armoury Crate game launcher-meets-dedicated console UI. Its looks haven’t changed dramatically since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20896952/asus-rog-phone-ii-review-android-gaming-phone-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Phone II&lt;/a&gt;, but in case you’re hearing about this for the first time, it’s filled with so many useful features for gamers. It lets you make a “scenario profile’’ for each game, where you can tweak settings to get more out of each game and, in turn, squeeze more performance from the ROG Phone 5. A profile consists of things like what refresh rate you want the screen to run at, and how much you want to amp up the power of the processor, graphics chip, and RAM. It even lets you turn off network switching, as well as background data and app syncing on a per-game basis. If you’re familiar with gaming on PC, the closest parallel is Nvidia’s GeForce Experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD1CH1"&gt;A big part of this software — and one of the more compelling features of the phone itself — is configuring AirTriggers. These ultrasonic sensors embedded within the phone can be mapped to emulate buttons so you don’t need to use the touch screen as often. All of the ROG Phone 5 models have sensors along the right edge, so they feel like triggers when you’re holding them in landscape mode. The Ultimate and Pro models add two additional touch sensors near where my ring fingers rest on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZLYieS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10382549"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9a4qX"&gt;As a way to avoid using clumsy touch controls, AirTriggers are still as handy and clever as ever. Being able to map the jump and attack commands in games like &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; actually makes those mobile ports fun to play for me. What’s great is that games don’t need to support controllers for the feature to work. While a game is running, you can move an AirTrigger cursor onto whichever command you’d like to create a “button” for on the phone. In the settings, you can choose whether you want to tap or swipe to issue the command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVb21X"&gt;I’ve barely scratched the surface in terms of the settings you can tweak. In addition to AirTriggers, you can map motion controls to execute commands. And by clamping the included AeroActive Cooler 5 fan onto the phone, it affords two extra trigger buttons that can be mapped to your liking, plus a kickstand. There’s just &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; customization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AeroActive Cooler 5 snapped on. I have my middle fingers resting on the mappable triggers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QZpaJR"&gt;Outside of gaming on a PC, I’m in the “controller or bust” camp, and thus, I don’t usually want to suffer through touch controls to play the latest Android games. AirTriggers makes the experience better, no doubt, but it’s still not enough to convert me. Thankfully, for people like me, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate (and the other new models) supports some modern controllers, like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller, Sony’s DualShock 4, or Google’s Stadia controller. Impressively, the software lets you remap the controls for any mobile game onto those controllers. It detected my Xbox controller immediately when I connected it with an OTG adapter, and mapping the buttons was simpler than I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bauGjkOzCSny8HLoDmof6GV1c-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357258/genshinmapping.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s easy to map on-screen controls to a controller through the Game Genie function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmyjhj"&gt;As for the actual phone stuff, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a high-end phone through and through. It has responsive haptic feedback at every turn, whether you’re getting text messages, tapping your way through Asus’ ROG UI interface (its game-themed twist on Zen UI, which is refined as ever), or using the AirTriggers in a game. Asus told me that it tuned its haptics in-house, and compared to some other Android phones I’ve used, it doesn’t buzz loudly or rattle the phone. It’s what I hope more phone haptics feel like once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;Qualcomm and Lofelt roll out their haptics framework for other devices running the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;. But as Asus proved with this phone, a company can make good haptics if it wants to. This device has a 6,000mAh battery inside that’s split into two 3,000mAh cells, which Asus says helps with lower charge and discharge temperatures. Additionally, it allows the phone to recharge at 65W speeds, but it lacks wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The selfie cam is fine, but there’s some lens flare above Becca’s head, and the details are a little soft. Some people may like that, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ri3Fy1J78DFStaUnhPxWOh7lfVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357250/rogphone5ultimateportrait.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portrait mode is totally serviceable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xu9pgX"&gt;Asus has committed to launching the ROG Phone 5 lineup globally, but it hasn’t shared a specific launch date in the US or official pricing, which is why I’ve been going off a euro conversion. However, the company told me that all of these phones will work on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T, and to that end, they support these carriers’ sub-6GHz 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="PB9gZC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10382481"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="evccUQ"&gt;It’s amazing to see what a manufacturer can do when it isn’t worried about making the thinnest design with the best cameras, or stuck on meeting an ultra-competitive price point as the likes of Samsung, Apple, and Google are. Asus wasn’t afraid to get weird here, and that weirdness comes through in several ways that make it a good fit for gamers chasing after the most powerful phone in existence at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK1VPu"&gt;Though, the value here falls apart completely if you think about it too much. For the $1,580 that this phone costs, you could build a very good PC or get a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch together with change left over. Outside of paying for a phone data plan, this would add about $65 to that if you finance it with monthly payments over a two-year period. While this phone definitely has a leg up on the competition when it comes to power and software features, it’s not worth paying this much to get them. And if you just want to stream games via the cloud with Microsoft’s xCloud service or with Google Stadia, you only need to spend a fraction of this cost to get a phone that can do game streaming well. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdgHOlLWcRVY9Rb32zyALR7BehM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354177/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stock wallpapers are actually great this time around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qYdOzO"&gt;Like every gaming phone I’ve checked out yet, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is stuck in this weird place of being a very capable device that somehow delivers on its many promises, yet it still doesn’t feel worth the money. For average people who play the occasional game, either directly from their phones or through game streaming services, buying a cheap clip to fasten a controller to your phone will probably be a good enough solution. There are also some comfortable controller setups for iPhone and Android (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbones-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone’s Go&lt;/a&gt; and Razer’s Kishi for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) that can turn most phones into more of a Nintendo Switch-like experience that requires less fuss and far less of an investment than Asus’ ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will relaunch its Lite app in 170 countries with support for Reels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfFVYpywtSEOd1M73gemotupwhk=/1x0:3241x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940373/Instagram_Lite__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qI89VL"&gt;Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17512874/instagram-lite-app-developing-world-low-data-usage"&gt;launched its smaller Lite app&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 only to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/instagram-lite-shuts-down-in-advance-of-a-relaunch/"&gt;pull it from the Play Store&lt;/a&gt; in spring of last year. Now, the app’s getting a relaunch with new features and a slightly larger file size. Instagram announced today that the app will start rolling out on Android to 170 countries, including the US, through the Play Store, and that the new app requires only two megabytes, compared to the regular Instagram app’s 30MB. (The original Lite app only required 573 kilobytes, however, so it’s definitely larger than that.) No iOS version is planned for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLBZZS"&gt;This bigger size allows for new features, though, including the ability to send direct messages and record and post videos. It also prominently features the Reels tab on the homepage while forgoing the shopping tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rznfHc"&gt;In a briefing, Instagram Lite product manager Nick Brown said the team has “no plans” to bring shopping to Instagram Lite, but that Reels had “a lot of engagement” in India, which is why the team decided to keep that tab in this iteration of the Lite app. (TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;is banned in India&lt;/a&gt; currently and has reduced its team there, so Reels has had a chance to blossom without the competition.) Users won’t be able to make their own Reels from the app, however. They also can’t use augmented reality face filters, although the team is “absolutely” exploring it. Other, less data-intensive creation tools, like stickers, GIFs, and text can still be applied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBeMWz"&gt;For now, the app doesn’t have ads, although Brown tells&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the team is “committed to offering the full suite of monetization tools.” He and the team want to “take the space and time — that everything we launched in Lite we can fully support and that it is just as good of an experience as it is in the regular Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zA2agi"&gt;Many companies have launched smaller, pared-down versions of their apps for users around the world who might share phones or use older devices with less storage. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8730883/facebook-lite-slow-network-developing-world-android"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its Lite app in 2015 while TikTok &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/tiktoks-quietly-launched-lite-app-has-reached-over-12-million-downloads-since-august/"&gt;launched its version&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. For companies that need to be global in order to grow, a smaller app is one way to bring new users on board. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s long-awaited new webcam reportedly arriving at Surface spring event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T3EuMdZg2cAuVfD6ucBQwboNjBk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940361/vpavic_190404_3378_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C webcam on Microsoft’s Surface Hub 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sCdoLo"&gt;Microsoft is reportedly planning to release a new webcam this spring. The software giant has previously offered a variety of webcams under its LifeCam brand, but Microsoft hasn’t updated these significantly for 10 years. &lt;a href="https://petri.com/microsoft-to-unveil-new-webcam-this-spring"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Petri &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that a Surface event will take place this spring, and a new webcam will be on the agenda alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319854/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-specs-features-release-price-leak"&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1Mpyv"&gt;The webcam will reportedly include a privacy cover and support high dynamic range (HDR). While Microsoft uses 4K USB-C webcams on its Surface Hub 2 device, this new webcam is rumored to skip 4K support. It’s not clear what resolution will be supported, or whether it will support Windows Hello facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9ol4ccAVRpp6JBsiiG9deAnmEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358907/1313577f_2a54_4414_8bce_a2e8deb8ebc0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s old LifeCam webcams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FkDhy7"&gt;Whether Microsoft choses to use the Surface branding on this new webcam also remains to be seen. Microsoft’s Windows and devices chief, Panos Panay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17931724/microsoft-surface-studio-modular-usb-c-webcam-panos-panay-interview-2018"&gt;hinted all the way back in 2018 in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company was looking at releasing Surface-branded webcams. “Look at the camera on Surface Hub 2, note it’s a USB-C-based camera, and the idea that we can bring a high fidelity camera to an experience, you can probably guess that’s going to happen,” hinted Panay at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxQfK3"&gt;This isn’t the first time a new Microsoft webcam has been rumored. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/22/18152996/microsoft-windows-xbox-webcam-windows-hello-features-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thurrott &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that two new webcams would arrive in 2019, one for Windows and one for Xbox. Those webcams never launched, and consumers and businesses have been relying on webcams from Logitech, Razer, and others instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgIt1z"&gt;Webcams quickly became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;the gadget of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, as consumers flocked to buy the devices to work from home during the pandemic. Prices of webcams also shot up briefly early on in the pandemic, before supply caught up and demand settled towards the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s secret home robot Vesta reportedly in ‘late-prototype stage’ of development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP-GzawSE8xB5RpNiMlpolysTv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940282/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ER5gJ3"&gt;Amazon appears to have reached the “late-prototype stage” in the creation of its secretive home robot codenamed Vesta, claims a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-lab126-vesta-project-grows-but-insiders-are-concerned-2021-3?op=1&amp;amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4&amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The device has been under development for around four years and now has more than 800 employees working on it, says the publication. If the robot launches, it will be one of Amazon’s biggest and most ambitious new products, in the mold of the Echo, Kindle, and Fire Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OpWhX"&gt;Indeed, it’s comparisons to the latter device, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9292695/amazon-fire-phone-sales-end"&gt;failed smartphone project&lt;/a&gt;, that seems to be concerning some of those involved in Vesta’s development. “People are very skeptical — we’re worried it could turn into another Fire Phone,” one of six anonymous sources cited by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; as “directly involved in the project” told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQGY0Pj6kVKelOmcDxD3YJTv-O8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324194/dseifert_210219_4433_0012sq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vesta is reported to have a built-in screen like some of Amazon’s recent Alexa devices. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ge2ujl"&gt;As with any unannounced device of this scale, there is an abundance of unanswered questions and uncertain details. The basic premise, though, is that Vesta will be an Amazon Echo on wheels: a voice-activated assistant that can navigate your home, respond to your commands, and interface with other smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ7d9K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report contains a number of intriguing and speculative details, including the suggestion that the device is the size of “two small cats” — about 10 to 13 inches wide (your conversion may vary depending on your cats). The robot will reportedly be equipped with a screen, microphone, and several cameras. Additional features could include sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, and air quality; a “small compartment” for carrying objects; and a “waist-high retractable pole with a camera” which could be combined with machine vision tech to help users find items around their house like keys and wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_7f5sFnL4zzu944aChX1Jv84z8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21906023/20200921_image_blog_flyingcamera_sidebyside_2910x1637_fcc_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon owned-Ring announced a home surveillance drone last year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EuOCh"&gt;Vesta, which is named after the Roman goddess of the hearth, shows Amazon’s ongoing drive to embed its products in the heart of customers’ homes. Over the years, the company has launched a number of devices attempting to extend its reach into kitchens and bedrooms, from the discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/20/15840814/amazon-dash-wand-alexa-review"&gt;Dash Wand&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed users to order grocery products by scanning barcodes, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;Always Home Cam&lt;/a&gt;, a mini-drone announced last year by Amazon-owned Ring that provides mobile surveillance around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gISqC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says Amazon has been developing Vesta as a “top priority,” but that early sales projections are modest. “Amazon could initially launch it as a limited invite-only product, similar to what it did with its fitness band Halo, according to these people,” says the publication. This could prevent the company from squandering resources on unsold-inventory. Even mobile robots won’t get up and sell themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx2rt3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon announces Z9 flagship mirrorless camera in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tb7woiZCzprr9pqUBW_CD9Azw8w=/1x0:892x594/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68939863/z9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4SLmd"&gt;Nikon has &lt;a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/0310_z_01.htm"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; development of the Z9, its highest-end mirrorless camera to date and the first in the Z-mount line that the company describes as a flagship. Actual details are thin, but Nikon promises that it will deliver “the best still and video performance in Nikon history” upon release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OKdut"&gt;From the single image released, the Z9 looks like a cross between the current mirrorless Z7 and the D6 full-frame DSLR, with a built-in vertical grip. Nikon says the Z9 uses a newly developed full-frame sensor and a new image processing engine, with support for 8K video “as well as various other video specifications that fulfill diverse needs and workflows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDFZMG"&gt;That’s about it for details so far, except that Nikon says the Z9 will be released in 2021. Nikon tends to announce the development of its highest-end cameras this way, with full launches following a few months later. The D6, for example, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848720/nikon-d6-announced-no-details"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; to be in development in September 2019, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134272/nikon-d6-specs-price-release-date-announced"&gt;full reveal&lt;/a&gt; happened in February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Of course John Legere bought an $888,888.88 NFT from Steve Aoki</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="john legere assets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HgXuscLvVcAvLl2ormpORzSXPfs=/97x0:912x543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68939232/johnlegere_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ageKjQ"&gt;Of course John Legere, the former CEO of T-Mobile, has jumped into NFTs by spending $888,888.88 on one made by Steve Aoki, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/steve-aoki-john-legere-t-mobile-nft-music-1139134/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s nice to know he’s keeping busy after stepping down from T-Mobile’s CEO gig on April 1, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qk6Wo"&gt;The NFT in question is called “hairy.” It’s a 36 second-long video, featuring music — which &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone &lt;/em&gt;describes as “soundscapes in harmony with digital animations” and I would describe as “if Darude were making music from inside a Game Boy” — and this visual:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SEyIsF3LPr8_qa932wHVkKQcLPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358091/hairy___Carly_Bernstein_kr6a67_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Steve Aoki&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A portion of the &lt;/em&gt;Hairy&lt;em&gt; NFT.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3JS10D"&gt;Not only is Legere’s ownership of the video permanently embedded in the blockchain, but he’ll also get a screen in some acrylic that will display the NFT, &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/collections/aokitudiscoauction"&gt;as long as he doesn’t sell it in the next two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xv7yBKk8ZjGeQ9qx2Izsf5Jg560=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358191/pjimage___2021_03_05T155446.972_jvdsx2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Steve Aoki&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This display screen is also included in the package.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pS6vDe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGQfoN"&gt;Aoki is probably best known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20835774/monsta-x-steve-aoki-k-pop-play-it-cool-youtube-future-of-music-dani-deahl"&gt;his music career&lt;/a&gt;. The NFT is the latest in a series of Aoki’s eclectic projects, which include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278140/steve-aoki-capcom-street-fighter-arcade-cabinet-clothing-line-remix-dim-mak"&gt;a branded &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter II&lt;/em&gt; arcade cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, and several &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mIydP1sQs"&gt;Samsung commercials&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, his collection of NFTs with Antonio Tudisco visuals brought in $4.25 million, with Legere’s purchase as the biggest of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will host another Unpacked event on March 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NVocjJD4ydVmghhKgbpxTkhpBBI=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938959/Galaxy_Awesome_Unpacked_Invitation.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gcY3B9"&gt;Samsung has just announced an Unpacked event coming up on March 17th, 2021, its second for the year so far. The invitation calls the event “Galaxy Awesome Unpacked.” Between recent A-series leaks and the chaotic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLTrNq2MnBM"&gt;“awesome”-themed promotional video&lt;/a&gt; for last year’s models, it seems safe to assume that we’ll see the Galaxy A52 and A72 devices debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TVi4IB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0654Hm8Z6I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8RuIw"&gt;An entire event dedicated to unveiling midrange devices is a little unusual, but the leaked information we’ve seen thus far has pointed to Samsung taking these phones very seriously.  The A52 5G looks like it will receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309330/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-security-updates-leak"&gt;monthly security updates&lt;/a&gt; — something Samsung has tended to reserve for higher-end phones — and spec leaks have indicated we can expect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;high-refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DINTpF"&gt;If nothing else, we can hope that Samsung will bring the energy from last year’s unusual video to keep the event entertaining. You can watch by tuning in to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung"&gt;Samsung’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; on March 17th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. And please accept our apologies for embedding last year’s ad for the A51 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rovc4Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLTrNq2MnBM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Security startup Verkada hack exposes 150,000 security cameras in Tesla factories, jails, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/inHr_fsnZrHH1aqPs9cQ7OiyZdI=/252x0:2397x1430/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68938588/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_5.07.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verkada&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0nG8k6"&gt;Verkada, a Silicon Valley security startup that provides cloud-based security camera services, has suffered a major security breach. Hackers gained access to over 150,000 of the company’s cameras, including cameras in Tesla factories and warehouses, Cloudflare offices, Equinox gyms, hospitals, jails, schools, police stations, and Verkada’s own offices, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfru9C"&gt;According to Tillie Kottmann, one of the members of the international hacker collective that breached the system, the hack was meant to show how commonplace the company’s security cameras are and how easily they’re able to be hacked. In addition to the live feeds, the group also claimed to have had access to the full video archive of all of Verkada’s customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9lYXV"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, a Verkada representative commented: “We have disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent any unauthorized access. Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this potential issue.” Following &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s request to Verkada, the group lost access to both the company’s live feeds and archives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oaW5MN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Surveillance company harassed female employees using its own facial recognition technology","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21535089/surveillance-company-verkada-harassed-female-employees"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zemcsr"&gt;The hack was apparently relatively simple: the group managed to gain “Super Admin”-level access to Verkada’s system using a username and password they found publicly on the internet. From there, they were able to access the entire company’s network, including root access to the cameras themselves, which, in turn, allowed the group to access the internal networks of some of Verkada’s customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAeRd4"&gt;Verkada prides itself on offering internet-connected security cameras, promising a Silicon Valley “software-first approach” to make security “as seamless and modern as the organizations we protect.” The cloud-connected cameras include a slick, web-based interface for companies to monitor their feeds and offer (optional) facial recognition software, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCQfHB"&gt;The company has also come under fire in the past for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21535089/surveillance-company-verkada-harassed-female-employees"&gt;accusations of sexism and discrimination&lt;/a&gt; after an incident in 2019 where a sales director used Verkada’s office security cameras to harass female co-workers by secretly photographing and posting pictures of them in a company Slack channel. In response, Verkada’s CEO offered members of the Slack channel a choice between leaving the company or having their stock options cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeJKxh"&gt;The list of clients that use Verkada is broad: in addition to companies like Tesla and Cloudflare, the group gained access to Verkada cameras inside Halifax Health, a Florida hospital; Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut; Madison County Jail in Huntsville, Alabama; and Wadley Regional Medical Center, a hospital in Texarkana, Texas. In addition to the camera footage, the group also says that it was able to access the full list of Verkada’s thousands of customers and its private financial information. &lt;/p&gt;
