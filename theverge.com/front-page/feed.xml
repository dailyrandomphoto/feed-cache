    <title>Google links Android phones to Chromebooks with new Phone Hub feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtVbpSlFwJvTAKl95CB_OlZBbc0=/0x0:1686x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936690/PhoneHub.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Phone Hub feature in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qU9Hs0"&gt;Google is marking 10 years of Chromebooks by unveiling new features for Chrome OS today. The biggest addition is a new Phone Hub feature that connects an Android phone to a Chromebook. It allows Chrome OS users to respond to texts, check a phone’s battery life, enable its Wi-Fi hotspot, and locate a device easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhMf9B"&gt;Phone Hub is packed into a taskbar widget that even expands to show you recent Chrome tabs that you have been browsing on your phone. It looks like it will be a super useful feature for Android and Chromebook owners. Google is also enabling its Wi-Fi Sync feature on more devices, allowing you to connect to Wi-Fi networks you’ve already configured and used on your Android phone and other Chrome OS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wyd9637fcuhcT5cUNdmwx0GgdRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357091/Nearby_Share.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS gets an AirDrop competitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m7gXiT"&gt;Another significant addition to Chrome OS is Nearby Share between Chromebooks and other Android and Chrome OS devices. Much like AirDrop, Nearby Share will let people send and receive files between devices. Google says this will arrive in Chrome OS in the coming months, finally providing its laptop OS with a full AirDrop competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESABWk"&gt;Elsewhere, Google is also adding in a new Screen Capture tool into the Quick Settings menu in Chrome OS. Like the name implies, this will let you record your screen or take screenshots and access them quickly in a “Tote” space from the Chrome OS Shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md0_MxcinOWJhtqD2ZhZVTrsGrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357085/Screen_Capture.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Screen Capture in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bKkI6zBujcHNbONNUEOV-NPhuc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357087/New_updates_for_Desks.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual desktops improvements in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UbgfBY"&gt;The Clipboard is also being improved in Chrome OS, allowing you to save five recent items to paste elsewhere without switching windows. The Launcher Key will provide access to this updated clipboard experience. Quick Answers is another new addition, which lets you right-click a word in Chrome OS to get a definition, translation, or unit conversion. It’s very similar to what exists in macOS today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SosV2E"&gt;Google is even improving the virtual desktops feature of Chrome OS — Desks. When you reboot a Chromebook, it will now restore all windows to their correct virtual desktops, and you can also right-click at the top of an open window to send apps to a different virtual desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSqy1RbZdlTuV8JE2T_t7r6bBcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357088/Clipboard.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS’s clipboard feature is getting a history feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5vgH4n"&gt;Most of these new Chrome OS additions are clearly playing catch-up to what already exists on Windows and macOS, but they’re welcome additions for those relying on Chrome OS every day. Google first launched a range of Chromebooks back in 2011 in a partnership with Samsung and Acer. There are now Chromebooks from every major PC maker, and Google is promising that 50 new Chromebooks will launch during 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey’s first tweet may fetch $2.5 million, and he’ll donate the NFTy proceeds to charity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chrome Hearts X Jordan Barrett Host Cocktail Party" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhApRPgqYDGWk33EUbZ7ICINCaw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936222/1151694547.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Victor Boyko/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2UWlw"&gt;Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1369326373035245581"&gt;now plans to convert the proceeds&lt;/a&gt; from the NFT auction of his first tweet to bitcoin and donate them to charity. The highest bid for the tweet is currently $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q12Fl5"&gt;The auction will end on March 21st, and he plans to donate the bitcoin to &lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/"&gt;Give Directly&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that lets donors send money directly to people living in poverty. He’ll be giving the bitcoin to &lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/africa/"&gt;Give Directly’s Africa Response fund for COVID-19 relief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLJwGI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ending this March 21st&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will immediately convert proceeds to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And send to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GiveDirectly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; Africa Response&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1369326373035245581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2vPKJb"&gt;Dorsey put up his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20"&gt;famous first tweet&lt;/a&gt; as an NFT (which stands for “non-fungible token”) on Friday evening, and bids quickly poured in, even though Dorsey hadn’t announced when the auction would end or that proceeds would be going to charity. The current highest bid was made Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="S6izmA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIW5lq"&gt;The winner will get a “digital certificate of the tweet,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kBx-HXY8ow_7bElsJZ6Sk3r2V9cQjSRdWFyKCUXZtAs/edit"&gt;according to an FAQ on NFT auction site Valuables&lt;/a&gt;, where Dorsey’s tweet is for sale. However, the tweet will remain viewable on the internet for free, assuming that Twitter or Dorsey himself won’t remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch may be adding a ‘brand safety score’ for streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bws8TspabzjbzxK2XyzL9vHFM7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936085/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Cybersecurity researcher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tayariCS"&gt;Daylam Tayari&lt;/a&gt; has found evidence in Twitch’s internal API that the site plans to implement something called a “brand safety score” for its streamers. That score would depend on a number of criteria: the streamer’s age, a rating given by Twitch staff, their ban history, the relationship the streamer has with Twitch, their automod settings, their partnership status, the ESRB rating of the game being played, and whether the stream is set to mature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rCsvgd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitch has added an automatic Brand Safety Score which grades how brand friendly every streamer is based on things like chat behavior, ban history, manual ratings by Twitch staff, games played, age, automod and more (See below).&lt;br&gt;1/5 &lt;a href="https://t.co/VBl4HjGv7t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VBl4HjGv7t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daylam 'tayari' Tayari (@tayariCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tayariCS/status/1369230902409097218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xYizKA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitch a couple days ago added to their GQL (internal) API endpoints (keyword to query the API) for a "brandSafetyScore" which is sent to advertisers for ads, sponsors and also probably for bounty purposes.&lt;br&gt;Check this tweet's images for screenshots of the API changes.&lt;br&gt;2/5 &lt;a href="https://t.co/cHUzvnl50s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cHUzvnl50s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daylam 'tayari' Tayari (@tayariCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tayariCS/status/1369230907312279553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J8d4EV"&gt;If Tayari’s research is indeed accurate — and here I should note that I have reached out to Twitch and will update this story if I hear back — this would represent a shift in the way that advertisers interact with streamers on the platform. Presently, one of the main ways that marketers work with streamers on Twitch is the site’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/bounty-board-program-information-and-faq"&gt;bounty board&lt;/a&gt;; select partners and affiliates in the US, UK, Germany, and France can choose from a list of paid opportunities to either play games or watch branded videos with their communities for automatic payouts. It’s a pretty slick system, one that streamlines and automates the (occasionally arduous) process of working with a brand and getting paid for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aedmY"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine that if Twitch does in fact implement a brand safety score for streamers that it would be used to expand the bounty program; it seems like a useful thing for brands to be able to compare streamers on that specific axis, at least. Then again, for streamers, it does mean the site is tracking you on yet another metric that may or may not be available for you to see. I can’t help but think about Uber and Lyft ratings, and how quietly insidious they can be: if your rating gets screwed up for whatever reason, you lose your ability to drive — to make money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter sues Texas attorney general to stop content moderation probe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbFZwk7hXnZlCeJkoC8a8bt5H3A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935929/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EaL1sZ"&gt;Twitter has sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton for opening an investigation into its moderation practices, arguing that the probe attempts to “intimidate, harass, and target Twitter” in retaliation for banning former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtBbI5"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.374770/gov.uscourts.cand.374770.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed the suit yesterday&lt;/a&gt; in California federal court. It’s asking the court to stop Paxton from demanding “volumes of highly confidential documents” on Twitter’s content moderation system. “Twitter sought for weeks to reach an agreement with AG Paxton that would put reasonable limits on the scope of this demand, but to no avail,” its complaint reads. “This retaliatory conduct violates the Constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIKTso"&gt;Paxton &lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-issues-civil-investigative-demands-five-leading-tech-companies-regarding-discriminatory"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Twitter — along with Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon — in January. In his announcement, he cited Trump’s ban from Facebook and Twitter as a “discriminatory” and “unprecedented” action. His office &lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2021/Press/Twitter-Parler%20CID%20011321.pdf"&gt;requested all files&lt;/a&gt;, including emails and other communication, related to content moderation on Twitter. (It also asked for communications related to the smaller social media platform Parler, despite the fact that Twitter hasn’t taken action against Parler’s account.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cLnEKc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter says the demands are meant to “intimidate, harass, and target” it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk7FoE"&gt;Twitter says it was exercising its First Amendment rights by refusing to publish Trump’s speech on the platform. And it says releasing internal moderation data would let bad-faith actors “carefully design their content to evade Twitter’s scrutiny,” drawing on confidential information. “While Twitter strives for as much transparency as possible, it cannot practically make every aspect of its content moderation practices public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73gxCY"&gt;Citing Paxton’s public statements excoriating social networks for banning Trump, Twitter calls the investigation a ploy to pressure private companies into allowing content that breaks their rules, something the First Amendment may prevent government officials from  doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3cjFW"&gt;In addition to Texas’ investigation of tech companies, Governor Greg Abbott recently backed a bill that would broadly &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2317860"&gt;ban large apps and websites&lt;/a&gt; from suspending users or removing content — a move that would also raise significant constitutional questions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends: Wild Rift open beta kicks off this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJRPeYwN-Ie5S_s0rXTLWxMxSoI=/566x0:4316x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935809/Key_Visual.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WVaZV8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915315/league-of-legends-wild-rift-mobile-console-launch"&gt;spinoff&lt;/a&gt; of the PC game, is heading into open beta in North America on March 29th, developer Riot announced today. The beta will be available for mobile devices on iOS and Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="got5Fw"&gt;Riot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915315/league-of-legends-wild-rift-mobile-console-launch"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; in 2019; it promised a March open beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220354/league-of-legends-wild-rift-open-beta-americas-release-date"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The game isn’t a true port but instead a “built from scratch” version with changed elements like the game’s controls and its maps. North American players will have “full access” to &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; as part of the beta, with room for more players to join. Although &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;’s open beta is currently only available to mobile players, the game is also expected to launch on consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4LAcp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; was initially expected to launch last year but was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wildrift/status/1320862775229382656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1320862775229382656%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdotesports.com%2Fnews%2Friot-executive-producer-explains-wild-rifts-delay-in-north-america-south-america-and-india"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; due to the coronavirus pandemic; a full release date has not yet been announced.

    <title>Fortnite’s new season will kick off with an ‘explosive’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYQP804EfxRohQnrXrdlUv7z4Zc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935772/Fortnite_20201201161314.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1Wc5T"&gt;A new season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is almost here, which can only mean one thing: a big in-game event. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/play-the-zero-crisis-finale-in-chapter-2-season-6"&gt;Epic detailed what players can expect&lt;/a&gt; when season 6 of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second chapter kicks off. It sounds pretty ambitious and even includes a story-focused solo experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BTtet"&gt;The event has been dubbed the “Zero Crisis Finale,” and here’s how Epic describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JKkCxC"&gt;Chapter 2 Season 6 launches on March 16th with the explosive conclusion of the events of season 5. When you first launch into the new season, you’ll play through the conclusion of Agent Jones’ mission in the Zero Crisis Finale. The aftermath of this event is sure to shape reality as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eaaa9C"&gt;Don’t worry, the Zero Crisis Finale is a solo experience and you can play through it whenever you first log in during the season. Want to watch it online first? We’ll share details soon on how you can watch the global premiere with everyone, beginning with our most ambitious story cinematic yet!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russia partners with China for lunar space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Full Moon In China" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Ad_mA7-ZiId5nJmsPAff89jrBI=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935768/1304458365.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Fdmpd"&gt;Russia and China have signed an agreement to build and work on an “International Scientific Lunar Station” orbiting the Moon, the countries’ space agencies announced Tuesday. The space powers had been in talks for months as Russia mulled over whether it would participate in NASA’s Gateway program, a rival lunar space station to be built by a coalition of other countries in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iat536"&gt;The International Scientific Lunar Station that Russia and China will work on is “a complex of experimental research facilities created on the surface and/or in the orbit of the Moon,” Roscosmos said in a statement. It will be designed to support a variety of research experiments “with the possibility of long-term unmanned operation with the prospect of a human presence on the moon,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qca3F"&gt;Like NASA, China has been courting international support for its own plans to put infrastructure on the Moon. It’s also sent several robotic Chang’e missions to the Moon, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18127180/china-national-space-administration-change-4-mission-lander-rover-far-side"&gt;first landing on the Moon’s far side&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178582/china-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission"&gt;swift sample retrieval mission&lt;/a&gt; in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3ZoMM"&gt;The lunar space station agreement, signed virtually between China’s space chief Zhang Kejian and Russia’s space chief Dmitry Rogozin, marks the latest development in Beijing’s efforts to explore the Moon alongside rivals like NASA, which is barred from working with China under a law passed by Congress in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et2MAe"&gt;Russia, which has maintained a decades-long &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21276881/nasa-spacex-iss-international-space-station-future-commercial"&gt;partnership with NASA on the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, has been reluctant to extend its space alliance with the US to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXffir"&gt;NASA stepped up its push to return astronauts on the Moon under the Trump administration through its Artemis program. Part of that push involved spearheading a multilateral pact called the Artemis Accords, an effort to set standards of behavior in space. Nine other countries have signed the Artemis Accords so far, but Russia is not among them, after the US sought to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-moon-mining-exclusi/exclusive-trump-administration-drafting-artemis-accords-pact-for-moon-mining-sources-idUSKBN22H2SB"&gt;exclude&lt;/a&gt; Moscow from early talks on the Accords last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mS1EmX"&gt;NASA secured agreements with the European Space Agency, Japan, and Canada for work on its Lunar Gateway, the planned space station orbiting the Moon. NASA did ask Russia to be a part of building that station, but Moscow decided that NASA’s request for Russia to provide an airlock for Gateway was “impractical,” a Roscosmos spokesperson said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15SlS7"&gt;“NASA presented the Russian-American Memorandum of Understanding to Roscosmos concerning the cooperation within the Gateway project. The MoU suggested that Roscosmos commits to provide a crew airlock module,” the spokesperson said. “After studying the draft document, the participation of the Russian side to the volume suggested by the US partners was deemed impractical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1RQ4H"&gt;Russia soon pivoted its attentions to China’s lunar ambitions. Cooperating with China became one of Russia’s “top priorities” last year, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GxERG"&gt;The Russia-China agreement greenlights joint development of their own lunar space station, which calls for “planning, demonstration, design, development, implementation, and operation of scientific research station projects, including project promotion to the international aerospace community,” a statement from the China National Space Administration said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXFQHF"&gt;It was unclear what specific technical contributions would be made by Russia, whose military-civil space agency has been investing in new launch infrastructure despite a domestic climate of budgetary rollbacks. Russia’s space budget &lt;a href="http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=289878940"&gt;ranks&lt;/a&gt; third globally, behind the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Towy1x"&gt;China also held talks with France’s space agency CNES as a “status check of the bilateral space cooperation between the two agencies,” &lt;a href="https://presse.cnes.fr/en/cooperation-spatiale-entre-la-france-et-la-chine-reunion-entre-le-president-du-cnes-et"&gt;CNES said&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Among cooperation on climate science, Beijing’s Kejian and France’s space chief Jean-Yves Le Gall also discussed “other potential areas for cooperation in relation to the Moon and Mars,” the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a PDF file </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_A9ogUx0RoFP9fC2HQyVF7er9ro=/169x0:2308x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935744/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_10.03.56_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzJBN9"&gt;Now that so many people are working remotely, it’s become more accepted than ever for official documents to be sent digitally — and most are sent as PDFs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwDwqX"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with the background of that format, PDF stands for portable document format and was created by Adobe in the early 1990s to allow people and organizations to create exact digital versions of paper documents. The idea was that the document was an exact, unchangeable copy of the original (while some PDFs can now be edited, you can create a PDF that cannot). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAOr1Z"&gt;Since then, PDFs have become a standard for sending official documents. If you need to send something with any kind of legality, you’ll probably be asked to send it as a PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ9yHP"&gt;You can create a PDF from a hard copy document by scanning it and saving the scan as a PDF. But what if you are looking at an online document and you need to save it as a PDF? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJVsdR"&gt;It’s really simple, both for Mac and Windows PC users. And it’s done the same way in both: you “print” the document to a PDF file. These directions are for printing a web document using the Chrome browser, but this works for any app that has a print function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tlNfYY"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xqlB5i"&gt;Click on “Print...”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To create a PDF, start by going to your Print function" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2X7HIszGXaqsarmdIJmMjV13a44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356410/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_9.39.36_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To create a PDF, start by going to your print function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="PWSgwz"&gt;The print window will pop up with a preview box on the left and a series of features on the right. Next to the “Destination” label, click on the drop-down menu and select “Save as PDF.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Make your destination “Save as PDF”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ll1_5yEVBylSagnZhqrsCNc6xVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356415/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_9.42.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make your destination “Save as PDF.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="aSDSOR"&gt;If you have a several-page document and you want to create a PDF only using a specific page or range of pages, click on the drop-down menu next to the “Pages” label, choose “Custom” and type in which pages you want to save. (This works exactly the same as if you were sending the pages to a printer.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to select which pages you want to save to your PDF" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rB5jBXlkdNv08zAUwdcrBd4XfCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356419/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_9.51.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to select which pages you want to save to your PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QWRYsQ"&gt;Note that when you print a webpage to a PDF, you will print the entire page, not just what is currently viewable in the browser. So it’s a good idea to check in the preview box what is being printed and only print the pages you need — it’s a lot harder to edit a PDF document later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RT4uhE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMDOAa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRtVv8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Self-flying drones are helping speed deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d7lQmIMRYxy1pVJapT3zCAxHGeM=/250x0:2950x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935684/GIzDjxi.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zipline’s drones fly autonomously to their destination, dropping packages off via parachute. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zipline&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vFqzsF"&gt;The threat of COVID-19 has prompted many countries to draft new and emerging technologies to fight the pandemic, with the latest example taking flight in Ghana. This month, COVID-19 vaccines were delivered by drone for the first time in the West African nation, allowing the medicine to reach remote areas underserved by traditional logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yx4Cw"&gt;Deliveries were made by US firm Zipline, which started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11367274/zipline-drone-delivery-rwanda-medicine-blood"&gt;couriering blood and drugs&lt;/a&gt; in Rwanda in 2016. Since then, the company has expanded its operations to Ghana in 2019 and the US in 2020, delivering medical supplies and PPE in North Carolina &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21270351/zipline-drones-novant-health-medical-center-hospital-supplies-ppe"&gt;last May&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Ghana’s government has tapped Zipline to deliver the first vaccines supplied to Africa&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by the COVAX initiative, a project launched with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure that developing countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRxa33"&gt;“The reason Ghana was the first country to receive the COVAX vaccine is that they had the strongest application, and the reason they had the strongest application is they can guarantee the delivery of this vaccine to any health facility or hospital in the country at low cost and very high reliability,” Zipline’s CEO Keller Rinaudo told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bXGIHynpgKZuIKtx-YlSxZkIQZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356163/DSCF5031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zipline&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zipline’s drones are transporting the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine using passive refrigeration. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9cjvR"&gt;Rinaudo, naturally, credits this to Zipline’s presence in the country. Zipline operates four distribution centers in Ghana, each of which is part drone airport and part medical warehouse, housing a fleet of 30 fixed-wing drones as well as medical supplies. The aircraft fly to their destination autonomously, drop off packages via parachute, and return home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g9QoBh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zipline says its drones can make deliveries to a third of Ghana’s population&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Anbkhh"&gt;Zipline says each distribution center can make deliveries in a 22,500 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; surrounding area (8,750 mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Since 2019, the company has made more than 50,000 deliveries in Ghana, including more than 1 million vaccines, and claims its services can reach 12 million people — just over a third of the country’s total population. Zipline’s drones can deliver to hospitals, but also to temporary mobile clinics that will be used to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine in the country’s more remote areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHwO6v"&gt;Traditional logistics are still playing a major part in Ghana’s vaccination efforts (the United Parcel Service delivers the COVID-19 vaccines to Zipline’s distribution centers, for example), but Rinaudo says the pandemic has showed the benefits of Zipline’s technology, particularly as the drones require minimal human interaction. “During the pandemic you had a lot of traditional models breaking down,” he says. “And the number of vaccines going through our system went up by a factor of ten during the first two, three weeks of lockdown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYS7ya"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines being delivered by Zipline in Ghana are the Oxford-AstraZeneca variety, which, unlike some other alternatives, requires only regular refrigeration at temperatures of 2°C to 8°C to maintain stability. This means Zipline can transport the vaccines using the insulation it already uses for couriering blood and other vaccine types. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YMFmVBhuYsrNn2ixWR9imN_9-K8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356186/DSCF4725.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zipline&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccine doses delivered by drone can easily reach medical facilities without reliable infrastructure links. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RhSBB8"&gt;Rinaudo says the speedy nature of drone delivery helps with the challenges posed by “cold chain logistics.” There’s no need to worry about traffic delays in the sky, he says, and the drones, which travel at 100 km/h, take only 30 to 40 minutes on average to complete each delivery. That means passive rather than active refrigeration is all that’s needed to keep the vaccines at the desired temperature. “Think ice box not refrigerator,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1WKZy"&gt;On arrival at their destination, Rinaudo says the vaccines “go straight into a refrigerator or straight into somebody’s arm.” Zipline received its first batch of vaccines last Tuesday, making 36 deliveries and distributing 4,500 doses in a single day within Ghana’s Ashanti region. By Thursday, the company said it had delivered “almost all of the 11,000 COVAX doses” it had to distribute. It’s a solid start, though it represents only a small proportion of the 600,000 total doses &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-ghana-receives-600-000-free-vaccine-doses-as-part-of-global-scheme-12227511"&gt;delivered to Ghana in February&lt;/a&gt; by COVAX. Over the coming 12 months, though, Zipline says it plans to distribute some 2.5 million doses across Ghana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J7NEjb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drones alone can’t vaccinate the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvQ8Az"&gt;Beyond the immediate benefits to recipients, the swift and equitable distribution of vaccines around the world remains an issue of global importance. Writing in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/07/africans-covid-vaccinations-pandemic-paul-kagame"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, noted that if vaccination programs only cover rich countries, then new mutations of the virus that causes COVID-19 will “continue to emerge at a more rapid pace” in developing nations. “The pandemic will rage on, crippling the global economy,” wrote Kagame. “In this context, the billions of dollars it would cost to distribute vaccines across the developing world is not particularly high, given the return on the investment.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk2x4E"&gt;And while drones by themselves certainly can’t solve all the challenges associated with delivering medical treatment to remote areas, Rinaudo says Zipline’s work shows they can certainly be part of a bigger solution. “The people who typically get screwed when it comes to healthcare are the people who this service can reach,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="u4RJTh"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734417653060377708" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer has knocked the prices down on a handful of Nintendo-published games for the Switch, such as &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734417829387057974" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734417862903164917" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; only physical cartridges have been discounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Qmof"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fshop-by-video-game%2Fsuper-mario%2F5324366_9160790&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03092021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has price-matched Best Buy, but the retailer has more games available and the option to buy either a digital or physical copy. Now if you plan to take advantage of these deals, you may use all of the Switch’s limited internal storage. Fortunately, SanDisk’s 200GB microSD card is on sale for as low as &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsandisk-200gb-microsdxc%2Fp%2FN82E16820173362" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$22 at Newegg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y59Mq9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVJ7Uf"&gt;Speaking of Nintendo Switch accessories, if you prefer using your Switch in handheld mode but don’t want to spend $70 on a new pair of Joy-Cons, the best alternative is Hori’s Split Pad Pro controller. Usually $50, you can buy this controller for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHori-Nintendo-Switch-Split-Pad-Pro-Ergonomic-Controller-for-Handheld-Mode-Officially-Licensed-By-Nintendo-Black%2F539959895&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03092021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Most notably, this accessory includes an actual D-pad and more importantly, these controllers are bigger and more comfortable to use. &lt;/p&gt;
