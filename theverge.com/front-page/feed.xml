    <title>Elon Musk: ‘Bezos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="spacex dragon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LupGikDJWurXjdAFMiJN791b25Q=/0x24:560x397/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782406/20120316-dragonrider.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UbgL0p"&gt;Elon Musk has criticized fellow centibillionaire and space cowboy Jeff Bezos for filing lawsuits against the former’s aerospace company SpaceX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRVbJO"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;Bezos’ space firm Blue Origin sued NASA&lt;/a&gt; after it lost a critical government contract to put astronauts on the Moon to SpaceX. This has had the effect of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632990/spacex-lunar-lander-contract-paused-blue-origin-nasa-lawsuit"&gt;delaying SpaceX’s own work on the project&lt;/a&gt;. And now, this week, Amazon has &lt;a href="https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-444868&amp;amp;f_number=SATLOA2020052600055"&gt;urged the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) to dismiss newly-submitted plans by SpaceX to launch another cluster of satellites to power its satellite internet service Starlink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MPeMB"&gt;Replying to a story about the latter complaint, Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1431126154195443714"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Turns out Besos [sic] retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3ScwVdxLhYmuAi5OLj5vJlnhZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808830/Screen_Shot_2021_08_27_at_9.33.11_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="brKNFb"&gt;The recent complaint from Amazon doesn’t seem to be a formal lawsuit but rather a letter of protest. And, technically, it’s not that Amazon doesn’t want SpaceX to launch more Starlink satellites at all, but that it thinks the company should be clearer in its plans to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtVfc5"&gt;Starlink is currently powered by around 1,740 low earth orbit satellites, which serve an estimated 90,000 customers. SpaceX is gearing up to launch a tranche of 30,000 second-generation satellites to improve the service, and so has to inform the FCC exactly where they will be positioned around the Earth. Amazon’s complaint is that SpaceX is asking the FCC to approve two entirely different orbital configurations to be chosen between later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKU1Ij"&gt;“SpaceX’s novel approach of applying for two mutually exclusive configurations is at odds with both the Commission’s rules and public policy and we urge the Commission to dismiss this amendment,” writes Mariah Dodson Shuman, corporate counsel for Amazon subsidiary Kuiper Systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysbOAO"&gt;Shuman says that having to grapple with two possible configurations “doubles the technical effort” faced by other operators — including Amazon’s Kuiper System, which has yet to launch any satellites of its own. These parties will have to review “interference and orbital debris concerns” raised by two separate satellite configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZgjwr"&gt;Shuman’s preference is that SpaceX should pick a plan and stick with it, and that approving two configurations sets a bad precedent by allowing future satellite operators to hedge their bets while creating more work for the entire industry. She concludes: “Accordingly, the Commission should enforce its rules, dismiss SpaceX’s Amendment, and invite SpaceX to resubmit its amendment after settling on a single configuration for its Gen2 System.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Azure cloud vulnerability is the ‘worst you can imagine’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hOTbXf40I2ULpfkbljj1avQV9jM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782400/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another day, another major Microsoft vulnerability.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1yCiA2"&gt;Microsoft has warned thousands of its Azure cloud computing customers, including many Fortune 500 companies, about a vulnerability that left their data completely exposed for the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrYwXY"&gt;A flaw in Microsoft’s Azure Cosmos DB database product left more than 3,300 Azure customers open to complete unrestricted access by attackers. The vulnerability was introduced in 2019 when Microsoft added a data visualization feature called Jupyter Notebook to Cosmos DB. The feature was turned on by default for all Cosmos DBs in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0PgOi"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://gotcosmos.com/about/customers"&gt;listing of Azure Cosmos DB clients&lt;/a&gt; includes companies like Coca Cola, Liberty Mutual Insurance, ExxonMobil, and Walgreens, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7bdljg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We were able to get access to any customer database that we wanted&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4R8CqW"&gt;“This is the worst cloud vulnerability you can imagine,” said Ami Luttwak, Chief Technology Officer of Wiz, the security company that &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases"&gt;discovered the issue&lt;/a&gt;. “This is the central database of Azure, and we were able to get access to any customer database that we wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfJ84n"&gt;Despite the severity and risk presented, Microsoft hasn’t seen any evidence of the vulnerability leading to illicit data access. “There is no evidence of this technique being exploited by malicious actors,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/microsoft-cloud-databases-vulnerable-for-years-researchers-say?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Microsoft told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an emailed statement. “We are not aware of any customer data being accessed because of this vulnerability.” Microsoft paid Wiz $40,000 for the discovery, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szIXEk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases"&gt;detailed blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Wiz says that the vulnerability introduced by Jupyter Notebook allowed the company’s researchers to gain access to the primary keys that secured the Cosmos DB databases for Microsoft customers. With said keys, Wiz had full read / write / delete access to the data of several thousand Microsoft Azure customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeMK80"&gt;Wiz says that it discovered the issue two weeks ago and Microsoft disabled the vulnerability within 48 hours of Wiz reporting it. However, Microsoft can’t change its customers’ primary access keys, which is why the company emailed Cosmos DB customers to manually change their keys in order to mitigate exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrOIpC"&gt;Today’s issue is just the latest security nightmare for Microsoft. The company had some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/31/22208401/microsoft-solarwinds-source-code-russian-hackers"&gt;source code stolen by SolarWinds hackers&lt;/a&gt; at the end of December, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;Exchange email servers were breached&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;implicated in ransomware attacks&lt;/a&gt; in March, and a recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560435/microsoft-printnightmare-windows-print-spooler-service-vulnerability-exploit-0-day"&gt;printer flaw&lt;/a&gt; allowed attackers to take over computers with system-level privileges. But with the world’s data increasingly moving to centralized cloud services like Azure, today’s revelation could be the most troubling development yet for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No More Heroes 3 is as stylish and shoddy as ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MCT4EtohdFkRoAJ5XMWJ_KdqhAo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69782076/07_Action1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Nq1Vs"&gt;I was having a good time with &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; until I somehow lost my save file. I don’t think it was the game’s fault, but unfortunately since it’s coming out today for the Nintendo Switch, I wasn’t able to finish it in time for a full review. I did get several hours into it, though, and it was already feeling like a worthy followup to the Wii original, which I was a big fan of back in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ky3e7Q"&gt;Developed by Grasshopper Manufacture, there wasn’t anything quite like the original &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, an action game that saw video game nerd protagonist Travis Touchdown climb the ranks of the world’s deadliest assassins through a series of increasingly ridiculous boss fights. The game also featured an open-world structure where you had to perform menial tasks like pumping gas in order to earn enough money to register for the battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DZPIp"&gt;2010 sequel &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle&lt;/em&gt; dispensed with the open world, opting instead for a more traditional action game structure. But &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; returns to the original game’s design, a change that makes it feel like a true follow-up — for better and worse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGtZsmZFI7kEybL3M869kFzMU38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808585/02_Boss2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NyEzCl"&gt;Before you get to hit the streets on your Akira-esque bike, you’ll need to play through &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt;’s opening moments, which set the scene in typically bombastic fashion. Rather than mere assassins, this time you’re taking on a league of alien superheroes that makes up the posse behind a powerful CEO and a Thanos-like supervillain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LiShJl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its technical performance is as varied as its influences&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TQC8Nd"&gt;Suffice it to say that &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly stylish. The aesthetic is like grindhouse theater meets ‘80s arcade, with deliberately grungey, low-res elements clashing with a pixelated neon UI; the opening moments of this game are like nothing you’ve ever seen. The game often feels like an extended running joke, satirizing everything from &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; to the “next episode” button on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIPZmk"&gt;Unfortunately, and in keeping with the original game, its technical performance is as varied as its influences. Combat in &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; looks and feels great — it runs at 60fps and has a satisfying crunch to it, with or without the recommended Wii-style motion controls. (I played much of the game just fine with buttons and sticks on a Switch Lite, although it’s more convenient to recharge your lightsaber-style weapon by shaking a Joy-Con.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkXAHXIS1rCzG3tGcoRA-7PWiIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808586/06_Slash4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qTWo1k"&gt;But once you’re outside of combat, the game gets much less smooth, and performance in the open world falls off a cliff. &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; can’t hold anywhere near a solid 30fps when you’re driving your bike around the city — the constant hitches and judders honestly made me feel a little nauseous at points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2eWyh"&gt;Director Goichi Suda pledged in the video embedded above to “deliver solid and stable performance,” so maybe a future update will improve the situation, because that was certainly not my experience. It was enough to make me wonder why Grasshopper wanted to include the open world in the first place. We’re not exactly talking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; here; this is a barren environment with very little to do. You’re mostly just grinding missions for cash to get to the next boss fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpp8dw"&gt;Still, I’m going to start &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes 3&lt;/em&gt; again from scratch, which should say something about how entertaining I found the chunk I did manage to play. The technical issues don’t obscure the sheer passion and energy that have clearly been poured into this project, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319867/deadly-premonition-2-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;unlike, say, &lt;em&gt;Deadly Premonition 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of the game does actually play well. As with the original &lt;em&gt;No More Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, if the strong combat and unique sense of style click with you, it’s worth powering through the open-world drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VMILQ"&gt;&lt;small&gt;No More Heroes 3 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available today for the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $100 million settlement agreement changes a key App Store rule for developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIws0cqrESJtDaW4vTXq-uP4JDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69781576/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61502r"&gt;A proposed agreement between Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652460/apple-class-action-lawsuit-monopoly-app-store"&gt;a class-action lawsuit representing US app developers&lt;/a&gt; includes a $100 million payout from Apple. The &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement"&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; also has Apple “clarifying” its policies to explain that iOS developers can contact their customers, with permission, using information collected inside their apps to tell them about payment options outside the App Store. The change is a shift to the anti-steering policy that has been a big point of contention between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple and its critics for years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TmUqp"&gt;The change, while potentially important for developers, isn’t quite as significant as it may seem. In an update to the App Store Guidelines in June, Apple already changed its rules to allow developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;to communicate with customers outside of their apps&lt;/a&gt;, but at that time, they weren’t allowed to contact users about alternate payment options using information obtained inside the app — they would have had to figure out how to obtain their contact info another way. If this proposed agreement is approved, that restriction would no longer be in place, which should make it easier for developers to reach out to users. Still, it’s not what many developers have been asking for: a way to let users know, &lt;em&gt;inside their app, &lt;/em&gt;that they don’t have to pay using Apple’s in-app payment system and incur its up-to-30-percent toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1XFgjO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The proposed $100 million payout would be split by developers who made less than $1 million per year from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCRkq9"&gt;Apple’s press release spins the entire settlement as a generous offer to developers, including the anti-steering change: “To give developers even more flexibility to reach their customers, Apple is also clarifying that developers can use communications, such as email, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app,” &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/"&gt;the company writes&lt;/a&gt;. “As always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Store. Users must consent to the communication and have the right to opt-out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiPlG1"&gt;The company is also making a number of other concessions as part of the proposed agreement for &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15721902/cameron-v-apple-inc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameron et al v. Apple Inc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the big one being a payout of $100 million, which will be split among small developers who earned $1 million or less “for all of their apps in every calendar year in which the developers had an account between June 4, 2015, and April 26, 2021.” Apple has decided to name this the “Small Developer Assistance Fund.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99SSei"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.smallappdeveloperassistance.com/"&gt;website for eligible developers&lt;/a&gt; isn’t fully operational yet (and may not be until the settlement is approved by a judge), but court filings show how the money could be distributed. A proceeds tier ranging from one penny to over $1 million sorts out the potential return, with developers in line for a minimum payment of between $250 and $30,000. That will vary depending on how many people submit approved claims, with leftover funds going to the Girls Who Code nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ciylng"&gt;One of the lawsuit’s named plaintiffs, Richard Czeslawski, &lt;a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement"&gt;says in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “...we’ve gained the ability to use contact information obtained from signups in our app to communicate with our users outside the app about purchasing alternatives to IAP. That’s a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMS3GM"&gt;Other points include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MxAvSc"&gt;A promise to keep the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows developers who earn less than $1 million in a year to apply for a reduced 15 percent commission from their sales, in place in its “current structure” for at least the next three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UbCuwt"&gt;The company will publish an annual transparency report about the App Store. Apple says the report will include “meaningful statistics about the app review process, including the number of apps rejected for different reasons, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, objective data regarding search queries and results, and the number of apps removed from the App Store.” It’s unclear when the first report will be released, but the company is committing to releasing the report for at least three years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4NMX3q"&gt;Developers will be able to set more than 500 price points for subscriptions, in-app purchases, and paid apps. Right now, they’re limited to fewer than 100, so the jump will allow developers to offer a wider range of prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OLFgtE"&gt;Apple is committing to keeping the current App Store Search system in place “for at least the next three years.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1431058415263039488?s=21"&gt;Tapbots developer Paul Haddad points out why&lt;/a&gt; that’s not necessarily what all developers want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JHR0UR"&gt;The company will add an unspecified amount and type of additional information about the app appeals process &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/"&gt;to the App Review website&lt;/a&gt; to “help developers understand how the appeals process works.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PqSZj7"&gt;The proposed changes come on the heels of another big App Store change announced Thursday: Apple announced that it will take a 15 percent cut of publishers’ in-app purchases and subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission"&gt;if they join Apple News&lt;/a&gt; instead of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hacker claims responsibility for T-Mobile attack, bashes the carrier’s security</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiK1Qi"&gt;A person claiming to be behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;T-Mobile data breach&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;exposed almost 50 million people’s info&lt;/a&gt; has come forward to reveal his identity and to criticize T-Mobile’s security, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105"&gt;according to a report by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. John Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;that he was behind the attack and provided evidence that he could access accounts associated with it, and he went into detail about how he was able to pull it off and why he did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiPTSg"&gt;According to Binns, he was able to get customer (and former customer) data from T-Mobile by scanning for unprotected routers. He found one, he told the&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt;, which allowed him to access a Washington state data center that stored credentials for over 100 servers. He called the carrier’s security “awful” and said that realizing how much data he had access to made him panic. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, it’s unclear whether Binns was working alone, though he implied that he collaborated with others for at least part of the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unWKVf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns called T-Mobile’s security “awful”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFRnna"&gt;The information the hacker gained access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii"&gt;includes sensitive personal data&lt;/a&gt;, like names, birthdates, and Social Security numbers, as well as important cellular data like identification numbers for cellphones and SIM cards. T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fadditional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F26%2F22643277%2Ft-mobile-hacker-data-leak-claims-responsibility-criticizes-security" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s “confident” that it’s “closed off the access and egress points the bad actor used in the attack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXOl4y"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105?page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;/a&gt; goes in depth into Binns’ history as a hacker. He claims that he got his start making cheats for popular video games and that he discovered the flaw that ended up being used in a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/satori-iot-botnet-operator-pleads-guilty/"&gt;botnet that attacked IoT devices&lt;/a&gt; (though he denies actually working on the code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vX0k93"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binns describes a troubled relationship with US intelligence services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gEbWj5"&gt;According to Binns, his relationship with US intelligence services is troubled, to say the least. A lawsuit that appears to have been filed by Binns in 2020 demands that the CIA, FBI, DOJ, and other agencies tell him what information they have on him. The lawsuit also accuses the government of, among other things, having an informant try to convince Binns to buy Stinger missiles on an FBI-owned website, attacking Binns with psychic and energy weapons, and even with being involved in his alleged kidnapping and torture. An FBI response to his lawsuit denied he was being investigated by the bureau for the botnet or having information related to the alleged surveillance, and abduction, and torture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4ArHL"&gt;Binns told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that one of his goals behind the attack was to “generate noise,” saying that he hopes someone in the FBI will leak information related to his alleged kidnapping. It’s not likely that Binns’ situation will be improved now that he’s shone a spotlight on himself as the person who hacked one of the US’s major carriers. However, if his reports about how he gained access to a vast trove of T-Mobile data are true, it paints a concerning picture of the carrier’s security practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Palantir invested $25 million in Faraday Future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0MNnGRzGYvKD6Jp-Ygh_h6DWNEU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69780537/19060IOVS_001_Header_final.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wOlpxH"&gt;Data-mining firm Palantir invested $25 million in Faraday Future shortly before the electric vehicle startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587530/faraday-future-nasdaq-ffie-spac-ipo-investors-funding"&gt;became a publicly traded company in July&lt;/a&gt;, according to a previously unreported Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001805521/000121390021044112/ea146046-s1_faraday.htm"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; filed late last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo9Zfd"&gt;In addition, Faraday Future signed a commercial contract to use Palantir’s software, according to one of Palantir’s &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001321655/000095012321010430/d175251d10q.htm"&gt;most recent SEC filings&lt;/a&gt;. Neither company disclosed how much Faraday Future is paying, though Palantir’s filing notes the contract will last between four and six years. Representatives for both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuFGZg"&gt;Palantir says its software is meant to serve as a “central operating system” for companies that need to sift through lots of data. Its customers have included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/21/14012534/palantir-peter-thiel-trump-immigrant-extreme-vetting"&gt;the US Customs and Border Protection agency&lt;/a&gt;, which used Palantir software to track immigrants during the Trump administration, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd"&gt;police departments&lt;/a&gt; around the country, which have used Palantir’s controversial predictive policing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XqTrzI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Palantir has recently invested in a number of startups — and sold them software, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tDVzkY"&gt;Palantir’s investment was part of the so-called Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) portion of the merger with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; (SPAC) that made Faraday Future public. PIPEs are essentially a fundraising round that happens concurrently with many SPAC mergers. Faraday Future raised a total of around $795 million in its PIPE, which included other investors like Geely, China’s largest private automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diE1Xj"&gt;Palantir’s participation in the PIPE is just the latest in a rash of investments the company has made in startups that are (or were) in the process of merging with SPACs. In some of those instances, Palantir has followed up its investment with a deal to sell its software services to the company in question, as &lt;a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue"&gt;was first reported in July by journalist Eric Newcomer&lt;/a&gt;. (One robotics startup, Newcomer reports, is paying Palantir $42 million to use its software, following a $21 million investment from the data-mining company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7V2tg"&gt;Faraday Future’s electric vehicles are going to create an incredible amount of data — at least, once they’re built. The company’s first vehicle, the FF 91 SUV, isn’t supposed to go into production until at least July 2022, and has been delayed for years as the company struggled. But when it exists, the electric SUV will be dotted with sensors and cameras meant to power an advanced driver assistance system in the near term and one day (perhaps) something closer to full autonomy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4lZpL"&gt;The inside of the FF 91 will be even more of a data-generation machine. There are cameras &lt;a href="https://www.ff.com/us/futuresight/building-FF91-user-experience-II/"&gt;in every seat capable of performing facial recognition&lt;/a&gt;, which will be used to quickly pull up all sorts of preferences for drivers and passengers, like their personalized app and media libraries, favored seating positions and climate settings, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLHrJ0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon TV app now available on Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-58mhMysu_3Mw13uh70rJqOFw8=/0x0:1602x1068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69780491/Screen_Shot_2021_08_26_at_3.55.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VH6MeB"&gt;The Switch still doesn’t have apps like Netflix or Twitch, but Nintendo decided to do us one better by &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pokemon-tv-switch/"&gt;announcing that Pokémon TV&lt;/a&gt; — the media app devoted to all things &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; — is now available on the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0N7Zb"&gt;Pokémon TV is an app that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; enthusiasts can use to watch episodes of the long-running cartoon series, videos offering tips and tricks to players, and competitive &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; broadcasts. The app launched in 2019 on mobile and smart TVs and is now available for free on Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6qlnh4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eefmgiP7Kfo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s0eha7"&gt;In addition to being able to watch episodes from all seven series of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; shows free of charge, the Pokémon TV app is also launching a Junior category with programming geared toward younger players and fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSBjAv"&gt;Twenty-five years after its debut in Japan, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; still enjoys an incredible amount of success. Last week, The Pokémon Company shared more information on its open-world, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;meets &lt;em&gt;Breath Of The Wild&lt;/em&gt; title,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630388/pokemon-legends-arceus-nintendo-switch-battle-system-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as updates on the forthcoming remakes &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Shining Pearl&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; got into the MOBA scene this year with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590249/pokemon-unite-nintendo-switch-hands-on-esports"&gt;wildly popular and surprisingly accessible &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokemon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;crushing the mobile market&lt;/a&gt; five years after its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1jhwe"&gt;Trainers who want to be the very best, like no one ever was, can download the Pokémon TV app from the Nintendo eShop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lbrzfj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Streamlabs launches monthly tipping service as an alternative to Twitch subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hLCAsDnKd8z_BP57HuVrxVNko4c=/479x0:1079x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69780449/monthly_tipping_ui_a_1090x400.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Streamlabs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgPj2B"&gt;Streamlabs, the popular livestreaming software company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20886060/logitech-streamlabs-obs-acquisition-twitch"&gt;owned by Logitech&lt;/a&gt;, is rolling out &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-unveils-new-way-for-viewers-to-subscribe-to-live-streamers"&gt;a “monthly tipping service”&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative way for streamers to earn money from their fans. Streamlabs Creator Subscriptions will offer streamers flexibility on what kinds of subscriptions they offer, and they will integrate directly into Streamlabs’ OBS software suite for streaming to Twitch, YouTube, or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4oail"&gt;&lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-monthly-tipping-tutorial"&gt;Using Streamlabs Creator Subscription&lt;/a&gt; seems about as simple as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026148/streamlabs-charity-twitch-mixer-red-cross"&gt;the company’s earlier donation tools&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/how-to-create-a-custom-tip-page-with-streamlabs"&gt;the tipping feature&lt;/a&gt; that already existed on the platform. Creators can enable or disable monthly tips in settings, along with setting specific subscription prices. There’s also the option to let a viewer tip whatever amount they want and send redeemable monthly tip notifications during a stream. Money from tips are deposited directly in creators’ PayPal accounts and Streamlabs says it doesn’t take a cut, though payments are subject to payment processing fees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTxPtmtMvnAOfDUa4Bs8VVfLWDA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22807535/0_6KK2z4_28jbsi19F.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Streamlabs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streamers can enable and disable monthly tips and pause payments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PyNA9M"&gt;As yet another method for streamers to earn money off their work, Streamlabs’ feature could be a meaningful one, especially in comparison to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;the 50 percent cut of subscription revenue Twitch offers&lt;/a&gt; through its platform directly — a feature that’s limited to Twitch Partners. In comparison, “Streamlabs Creator Subscription is open for anyone with a Streamlabs tip page, regardless of size or how often they stream,” according to Ashray Urs, Streamlabs’ head of product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOj95M"&gt;The relative openness of Streamlabs has come with its own problems, however. The company &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/streamlabs-streamelements-far-right-white-supremacy-monetize/"&gt;has struggled with moderating less savory uses of its payment features&lt;/a&gt;, particularly by white supremacist and far-right figures. As more of a payment manager than a payment processor, Streamlabs does have some built-in distance between it and the things its products are used for, leaving moderation to payment processors like PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Memynt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoIJ6n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEppf2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can stream Cruella for free on Disney Plus starting on August 27th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Emma Stone as Cruella de Vil. She has black and white hair and is dressed in a structured leather ballgown. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-hTb-MKAEWdTBpI0xpjH-JXREA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69780257/cru_24747_r2_79c1746d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DcjG5L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1135784/9358?subId1=VergeCruella082621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fcruella%2F2GJTZuO8I01c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; subscribers will finally be able to watch the Queen of Mean on the service at no additional cost beginning Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nswpll"&gt;The live-action origin story of Disney’s notorious Cruella de Vil will hit the service tomorrow after debuting simultaneously in theaters and on Disney’s Premier Access platform on May 28th. Premier Access releases typically run viewers an additional $30 on top of their monthly or yearly subscription costs to be able to access the film early. But &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1135784/9358?subId1=VergeCruella082621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fcruella%2F2GJTZuO8I01c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will officially join the Disney Plus library beginning this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L7Gkl"&gt;Emma Stone stars alongside a pack of &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/cruella-director-craig-gillespie-real-cgi-dogs/"&gt;sometimes real, sometimes CGI dogs&lt;/a&gt; in a spin on Disney’s animated &lt;em&gt;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&lt;/em&gt;. This one, though, is set in 1970s London and sees Stone take on fashion icon Baroness von Hellman. The plot deviates pretty significantly from the 1961 original, so don’t walk into Stone’s spin on de Vil expecting a mere live-action remake. Instead, Stone serves up an almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400212/cruella-review-disney-plus-emma-stone-101-dalmatians"&gt;Joker-like spin&lt;/a&gt; on Disney’s infamous dog murderer that leans &lt;em&gt;heavily&lt;/em&gt; into OG Cruella’s taste for the extravagant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cExXJO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DbnTIRNKipg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zj8JlO"&gt;The film centers on a young girl named Estella — who later becomes known as Cruella — with a flare for punk fashion in 1970s London. Along the way, she teams up with a pair of thieves, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400212/cruella-review-disney-plus-emma-stone-101-dalmatians"&gt;inexplicably develops&lt;/a&gt; a wicked personality, and ultimately becomes a revenge-hungry maniac with delectable taste in clothing. (Stone looks fabulous pretty much the entire movie.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xjj9V"&gt;Despite the film’s campy absurdity, it seems Disney is already working on a Cruella franchise. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/emma-stone-cruella-sequel-deal-with-disney-1234998854/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cited sources as saying that Stone had locked in an eight-figure payout for a Cruella sequel. Details about who’s attached to the project and when it’s projected to release, however, are still under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ULA stops selling its centerpiece Atlas V, setting path for the rocket’s retirement</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jOEqmz"&gt;United Launch Alliance won’t be selling any more of its workhorse Atlas V rockets, and it has stopped buying the launch vehicle’s Russian-made rocket engines for good, the company’s chief executive told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;ULA’s decision sets up the retirement of one of the US government’s most trusted launch vehicles and is expected to mark the end for Russia’s iconic — but controversial — RD-180 engine, an engineering marvel and a core source of revenue for Russia’s space program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzMOw9"&gt;“We’re done. They’re all sold,” CEO Tory Bruno said of ULA’s Atlas V rockets in an interview. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has 29 Atlas V missions left before it retires sometime in the mid-2020s and transitions to its upcoming Vulcan rocket, Bruno said. The remaining Atlas V missions include a mix of undisclosed commercial customers and some for the Space Force, NASA, and Amazon’s budding broadband satellite constellation, Project Kuiper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZraOW"&gt;First launched in 2002, the expendable Atlas V launcher was the centerpiece vehicle that helped cement ULA’s near-monopoly on national security satellite missions and some of NASA’s biggest space exploration initiatives, including all of the agency’s robotic missions to Mars. But when the US sanctioned Russia over its annexation of Crimea in 2014, Congress directed the Air Force to end its reliance on Atlas V because of its Russian-made RD-180 engines. Current law requires the Space Force (which manages much of the launch-related duties that used to be under the Air Force) to stop using Atlas V for Pentagon launches by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WNNag1"&gt;Bruno said three or four RD-180s are installed on Atlas V rockets for upcoming missions, and the rest are sitting in a warehouse. “We took early delivery, if you will, with the RD-180, so I can end that relationship and not be dependent upon [Russia] because that’s what Congress asked us to do,” he said. In all, the US has taken delivery of 122 RD-180 engines, generating billions in revenue for Russia’s space program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OulBVo"&gt;The last six RD-180 engines were delivered to the US in April, Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, has previously said. That month, Bruno’s Russian counterparts told the CEO that if ULA ever decides to buy more RD-180 engines in the future, they’d be willing to build more and sell. But with no plans for ULA to buy more, the RD-180 program will likely come to an end, Bruno said. He took Russia’s offer with a grain of salt, skeptical that Energomash, the state-owned manufacturer of the RD-180, would be able to restart its engine production line and testing regime after it closes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP59EZ"&gt;A spokesperson for Roscosmos, which speaks on Energomash’s behalf, declined to comment on whether RD-180 production is ending. The space agency’s former director, Igor Komarov, said in 2017 that Roscosmos has had “requests from some countries that are developing launchers and their expertise in space” to use the RD-180 engine, but those prospective engine customers remain to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7SHdv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Atlas V saw tough competition from SpaceX&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PfyBSA"&gt;The geopolitics of the RD-180 engine wasn’t the only reality setting Atlas V back. The rocket struggled to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9, a cheaper reusable rocket that chipped away at ULA’s monopoly on government launch contracts. Though a recent win for the rocket came in April when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391508/amazon-ula-rocket-launches-internet-satellites-kuiper"&gt;Amazon revealed it picked Atlas V&lt;/a&gt; to launch its internet-beaming Kuiper satellites into space. The value of the deal wasn’t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdraeF"&gt;ULA has slashed the price for Atlas V missions from roughly $187 million to around $100 million as competition from SpaceX mounted, but it never closed in on Falcon 9’s launch price of roughly $62 million. Once a dominant force for national security launches, ULA now competes head to head with SpaceX for lucrative Pentagon launch contracts. Last year, Space Force awarded billions to ULA and SpaceX to launch 30 to 35 missions for the Pentagon between 2022 and 2027, with ULA getting 60 percent of the workload and SpaceX getting the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08hSyA"&gt;For those Pentagon missions, ULA will mainly use its next-generation lower-cost Vulcan rocket, the replacement for Atlas V. Vulcan will use BE-4 engines under development by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin — but those engines have been delayed, further pushing Vulcan’s launch debut from late 2021 into early 2022. Development issues with the engine’s turbo pump and excessive vibrations that would occur while the engine was test-firing were the main factors for the delays, Bruno said, but they’ve since been resolved. “What is pacing us now is just building hardware,” he said, expecting delivery of the first flight-ready engines by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T0hrNq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Obviously we’re concerned, but we’re engaged with ULA”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ngnX26"&gt;The Space Force is weighing whether it’ll need to come up with “backup options,” should BE-4 delays continue into next year, Gen. Jason Cothern, the deputy commander of Space Force’s rocket acquisition unit, said Wednesday. Those options could include shifting some of Vulcan’s workload under its share of Pentagon launches to SpaceX, but officials are waiting to make a move on any contingencies until next year to see how the final chapter of BE-4 development plays out. “Obviously we’re concerned, but we’re engaged with ULA and they’re heavily engaged with Blue Origin to bring it along,” Cothern said, adding “we’re cautiously optimistic” that the flight-ready BE-4 engines will be delivered to ULA by year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
