    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The biggest government fleet is about to start turning over — but the replacements aren’t as green as many hoped&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3J9H7n"&gt;The United States Postal Service (USPS) recently revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;a new mail truck&lt;/a&gt;, which is good because the current ones are prone to breaking down and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3ezx4/post-office-delivery-trucks-keep-catching-on-fire"&gt;catching fire&lt;/a&gt;. But a chorus of people — including members of Congress, environmental groups, and even President Joe Biden — are not happy that most of the replacements will be powered by gasoline, not batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE7d8a"&gt;Sticking with gas doesn’t make much sense in a world where electric vehicles are growing increasingly popular and governments outside the US are laying out timelines for banning gas vehicles. The short stop-and-go routes that most mail carriers take are well-suited for electric vehicles, even ones without an abundance of range. The USPS &lt;a href="https://about.usps.com/what/corporate-social-responsibility/sustainability/report/2020/usps-annual-sustainability-report.pdf"&gt;doesn’t break out its fleet emissions&lt;/a&gt; in its sustainability reports (and it declined to do so when asked), but it’s safe to say switching to electric could help the agency cut way back on fossil fuel usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLEYyd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The current fleet desperately needs to be turned over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPH2mq"&gt;The USPS started the bidding process to replace the current vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/automobiles/the-mail-truck-is-a-classic-and-thats-a-problem-for-a-modern-post-office.html"&gt;a half-decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, when Tesla’s Model S and the Nissan Leaf were some of the only electric vehicles on the market and legacy automakers had yet to announce multibillion-dollar investments into the technology. There was always a chance the contract would go to a bidder that wasn’t focused on new technology. In fact, by the time the USPS put out the final call to bidders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, the competition had essentially narrowed to two companies: Workhorse, a startup with a short and sketchy history that was pitching an all-electric mail truck, and Oshkosh, a defense contracting stalwart. (A third, Turkish vehicle manufacturer Karsan, was considered a long-shot contender.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLk2z4"&gt;Oshkosh won the award in February, which could ultimately be worth some $6 billion. And while it says &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;of the mail trucks it builds &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be electric when they hit the road in 2023, neither the company nor the USPS has offered concrete details about how many — or how a defense contractor with no history of making EVs plans to provide them to the largest federal fleet. It took Postmaster General Louis DeJoy getting dragged in front of Congress just to get his estimate that the fleet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300281/usps-new-mail-truck-ev-electric-workhorse-biden-dejoy"&gt;could be around 10 percent EVs&lt;/a&gt;. And even then, he said his agency would need billions more dollars to push that number any higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OqwYI"&gt;Some members of Congress &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/lawmakers-back-8-billion-for-electric-u-s-postal-vehicles"&gt;are willing to do just that&lt;/a&gt; provided they get assurances that the mix of EVs is high. But even if DeJoy gets that money, it’s still not clear what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; can be done, as the whole process played out behind a thick veil of secrecy. (Even email correspondence obtained  via the Freedom of Information Act by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; between the remaining bidders and the USPS across 2020 was almost entirely redacted.) The contract with Oshkosh is currently stuck behind that veil, too, meaning everyone outside the defense contractor and the USPS has been playing a guessing game as to what it entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EkGDcJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This should not be a black box”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48ny2V"&gt;Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) is one member of Congress who has proposed giving more money to the USPS to electrify the fleet. But he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview that he thinks Congress should scrutinize the whole bidding process and that hearings about the award are on the table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsCLGp"&gt;“This should not be a black box where the Postal Service gets to do this without any eyeballs on it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Booming U.S. Recovery Is Leaving Some Communities Completely Behind" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IO0JEi97Z04leDaDUh74CPfdla8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511876/1232710979.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uBgMaP"&gt;The choice to go with Oshkosh &lt;a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/brown-urge-president-review-postal-vehicle-contract"&gt;may have been a deliberate move&lt;/a&gt; by DeJoy (a Trump-era holdover) to ruin Biden’s push to electrify the government fleet. Or it could just be an unsurprising but suboptimal outcome at the end of a long and &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;tortured&lt;/a&gt; government contracting process. After all, competing bidders with hybrid or alternative fuel prototypes dropped out before the final stage, and Oshkosh was arguably the most reasonable choice that remained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ04jw"&gt;That’s because Workhorse does not have a robust track record. Founded in 1998 as a commercial van manufacturer, the original version of Workhorse made gas and diesel vehicles and was later bought by trucking giant Navistar in 2005. Navistar eventually sold Workhorse to a company that retrofitted combustion engine cars with EV powertrains called AMP Electric Vehicles &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prweb.com%2Freleases%2F2013%2F3%2Fprweb10527832.htm&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22423179%2Fusps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and AMP subsequently took on the Workhorse name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QWF1ds"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Workhorse was pitching an EV, but it doesn’t have a robust track record&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJtygD"&gt;This new-look Workhorse was able to land some small-scale partnerships with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17040180/ups-electric-delivery-trucks"&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ryder.com/solutions/fleet-leasing/advanced-vehicle-technology/workhorse-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; for an electric delivery van it had in development, but the company bled money following the combination with AMP. To stay afloat, it leveraged its patents and other assets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;in exchange for loans from Marathon Asset Management&lt;/a&gt;, a hedge fund known for investing in distressed companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJq28L"&gt;It wasn’t until Workhorse’s former CEO, Steve Burns, left in 2019 to found a new company called Lordstown Motors that things got less dire. Lordstown Motors bought the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;recently shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, plant from General Motors&lt;/a&gt; — a move praised by then-President Trump — and paid Workhorse millions of dollars to license intellectual property for an electric pickup truck that was in development. Workhorse also got an equity stake, which is now valued at around $200 million after Lordstown Motors went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOKcFZ"&gt;Still, Workhorse has no experience building electric vehicles in high volumes. That may be why it was considering outsourcing the USPS contract. According to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000162828020003532/wkhs-2019x10kxex1041xi.htm"&gt;filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC), Workhorse had guaranteed Lordstown Motors the right to bid on manufacturing the mail truck, though it said it would consider other contract manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmVcyw"&gt;Lordstown Motors has yet to put its pickup truck into production, and there are questions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;about the progress it’s making&lt;/a&gt;. It’s impossible to say whether Workhorse’s inexperience or its plan to outsource manufacturing played into the USPS’s decision to go with Oshkosh. But Rep. Ryan, who has voiced a lot of support for Lordstown Motors, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he views Workhorse’s relationship with the startup as a potential boon — not a drawback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgaGdu"&gt;“The platform they’ve developed is so far advanced from [where it was at] the beginning of the contract,” Ryan said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Endurance All-Electric Pickup Truck Reveal Event" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCWjnUKGChBCXw-oi5WYvrlutfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511938/1222922470.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mwf2QF"&gt;Ryan isn’t the only one applying pressure. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) also &lt;a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/kaptur-introduces-resolution-calling-halt-usps-oshkosh-contract-light"&gt;introduced a resolution in March&lt;/a&gt; meant to halt the award until an investigation can be done. And Biden has continued to express his desire for the entire federal fleet to be replaced with electric vehicles as part of his massive infrastructure overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ti7G21"&gt;The best hope for reversing or amending the award may lie in the USPS’s still-secret contract with Oshkosh. If that contract has what is known as a “termination for convenience” clause, the USPS could get out of it for almost any reason, a person who has worked in government contracting told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The agency would not be subject to claims of breach of contract or damages and would only have to pay termination costs. And since the USPS has so far only publicly committed to funding more of Oshkosh’s design work and scaling up some of its manufacturing, that may not be such a huge bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KapSrW"&gt;It’s possible the contract instead has what’s known as a “liquidated damages clause,” which typically lays out how either side can get out of the deal, this person says. (There could be language that says the USPS has to pay certain amounts depending on how many days’ notice it gives Oshkosh that it’s canceling the deal, for example.) This isn’t as standard as the termination for convenience clause, but it has shown up in postal contracts past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8HWAhh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Any changes to Oshkosh’s mail truck could hinge on the language of the secret contract&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WXMbxy"&gt;Another possibility is that the USPS’s board of governors may still hold sway over the contract. The board approves all of the postal service’s large capital investments, and while it may have already made some approvals that allowed the USPS to move forward with Oshkosh, there could be more approvals waiting — especially since the full award doesn’t seem to have been granted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua027S"&gt;The board of governors is also the sole entity with the power to remove DeJoy, though right now, that board is not operating at its full nine-member capacity. Biden has nominated three new members that would fill it back out and give it — on paper at least — a 5-4 Democratic majority. But it’s not certain that they would replace the Trump-era holdover, and at least one of the nominees has pledged to try to work with Dejoy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8SrCF"&gt;(The USPS declined to go into specifics on the Oshkosh contract. “The Postal Service recognizes that powertrain technology may change significantly over the available 20-year life of the [new vehicle], and as such, the USPS selected a flexible design platform that can accommodate advancements in technology,” a spokesperson said in a statement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPmVDc"&gt;There’s also the possibility that Workhorse will formally challenge the contract, either through the USPS’s own internal appeals process or with a more public contest — similar to how Blue Origin is fighting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;NASA’s recent lunar lander award to SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; or how Amazon challenged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423312/pentagon-microsoft-jedi-amazon-trump-defense-contract-cloud-bezos"&gt;Microsoft’s cloud computing contract with the Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQuHjS"&gt;A reversal may not be needed, though. The USPS has only committed to investing $482 million so far, which Oshkosh is supposed to use to “finalize the production design” of the vehicle. Oshkosh has agreed to make between 50,000 and 165,000 trucks over 10 years. The USPS has also been careful to say that the current fleet will be replaced with not only the new mail truck, but also what it refers to as “commercial off the shelf” vehicles (which are typically the larger USPS-branded vans and trucks you may see in your neighborhood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7eqyS"&gt;“That does suggest there’s a lot of latitude and optionality, and that’s pretty common with these types of contracts,” Ben Prochazka, the national director of nonprofit Electrification Coalition, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBs9fp"&gt;Jimmy O’Dea, a senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, agrees. It’s relatively early on in the sense that the contract was just awarded,” he said in an interview. “What strikes me is the first part of the award is a $500 million component just to finish designing the vehicle. I guess that part gives me hope that things aren’t so baked they can’t be undone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_gC-YRUVC0rmGhLxZ2h1sEXBEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22323886/suburb2_9_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zFSzDV"&gt;In November 2020, Oshkosh warned investors in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000775158/000156459020054491/osk-10k_20200930.htm"&gt;a filing with the SEC&lt;/a&gt; that it “may not have the expertise or resources” to compete in a world that is increasingly reliant on electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OX7t5x"&gt;“While we are continuing to explore options to offer more propulsion choices in our products, such as electric-powered vehicles or mobile equipment, with lower emissions, this may require us to spend additional funds on product research and development and implementation costs and subject us to the risk that our competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRKhLs"&gt;While these so-called risk factors are included to make sure shareholders and potential investors are aware of the worst-case scenarios a company faces, that language still represents an admission that Oshkosh makes its bones on internal combustion engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfyYGk"&gt;In fact, through most of the bidding process, Oshkosh was assumed to only be working on an internal combustion option based on Ford’s Transit van. The most recent &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/"&gt;spy shots&lt;/a&gt; of that prototype showed a much bulkier vehicle than what’s in the computer-generated images released in February when the award was announced. (Ford has repeatedly declined to comment on whether it remains involved with Oshkosh.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="QndPEL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We won this fairly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FBXQCQ"&gt;How Oshkosh’s bid changed so dramatically in the closing months is yet another mystery. The company has crucially failed to explain how it plans to make its mail truck convertible to electric power, or what those conversions will cost, or who will foot the bill. And it hasn’t backed up its &lt;a href="https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/news/2-23-21-usps"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that the gas versions will “fuel-efficient low-emission” with any actual numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApgrYc"&gt;Still, CEO John Pfeifer defended the contract on &lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/oshkosh-takes-victory-lap-over-postal-service-delivery-truck-contract"&gt;a recent investor call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72r3Bw"&gt;“I emphasize that we won this program. It was a five-year process, and we won this fairly,” he said. “We know how to compete for government programs. It’s one of the things we know how to do. We won it fairly, and we won it because we have the best solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UmOfK"&gt;Pfeifer also said he believes Congress does not want to change the contract. Rather, he said the conversation in Congress has “been about increasing the rate of introduction of electric vehicles. It’s about how quickly [the Postal Service] can get the infrastructure up and running to recharge electric vehicles. But that will not delay this program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEGSQOUB0NtZ55cETu0Q2b8yEEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514220/NGDVsideView_scaled_bgresized.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ER0AEZ"&gt;Oshkosh’s mail truck has &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/lets-do-a-quick-design-evaluation-of-this-new-postal-ve-1846347843"&gt;a lot of sorely needed improvements&lt;/a&gt;, like advanced safety features, better &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2021/02/usps-new-truck-design-safety.html"&gt;visibility for the driver&lt;/a&gt;, and air conditioning. They will also — hopefully — be less likely to catch fire. Still, the USPS stands to benefit from increasing its reliance on electric mail trucks, regardless of who makes them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8QzXf"&gt;Electric vehicles require less maintenance, which means it costs less to keep them running. The USPS is currently spending some $700 million per year &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;on maintenance alone&lt;/a&gt;. Switching to electric mail trucks could therefore theoretically save money and keep the trucks running longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="ueqYCJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ncoA2"&gt;“For an institution that prides itself on working through rain or snow, this is an opportunity to say, also, ‘without mechanical failure,’” Prochazka said. He also said electric mail trucks could help the USPS’s bottom line because the price of electricity tends to be far more stable than the price of oil. “You have a lot more opportunity to insulate against price shocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tR0s8n"&gt;The USPS needs every last dollar it can save, too, in order to compete in an ever-crowding industry for package deliveries. And those competitors? They’re all going electric. FedEx and UPS have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311210/fedex-carbon-neutral-2040-2-billion-electric-vehicles-planes"&gt;made big claims&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://arrival.com/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles"&gt;turning over their fleets&lt;/a&gt; to electric vans and trucks, and Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric vans from Rivian and is now &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;a part owner&lt;/a&gt; of the EV startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GY2EOV"&gt;“The more and more people hear about this, the more ridiculous it sounds,” Ryan said. “It confirms what people’s view is of the stereotype of government: ‘let’s double down on the past.’ Governments need to be about the future, so we want to continue to generate public support for this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Katy Perry’s new music video stars her BFF Pikachu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Fq5qcAyaFcZW-4iDIAFzOEbTIs=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286421/Katy_Perry_Electric_Music_Video_Still.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xq81R3"&gt;Katy Perry’s latest video features an electric rat. The pop star released her new video for the single “Electric,” which is a surprisingly charming coming-of-age story about growing up with Pikachu as a best friend. It features a young Perry and her Pichu struggling early on in her career, while the current version of the star and Pikachu watch on, &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;-style. (In a curious twist, the video was directed by Carlos López Estrada, who also wrote and directed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315306/disney-raya-and-the-last-dragon-southeast-asian-media"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="tRYzNn"&gt;It may sound like a strange crossover, but it’s all part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228760/pokemon-25th-anniversary-katy-perry"&gt;Pokémon’s music-focused 25th anniversary celebration&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="GHfWSd"&gt;Of course, this is all part of a burgeoning convergence between music and gaming, which accelerated after live events were largely put on hold due to the pandemic.

    <title>Veritone launches new platform to let celebrities and influencers clone their voice with AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wludd7lICN-yAOnVjUU9knWzevc=/130x0:1750x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286408/Screen_Shot_2021_05_14_at_12.10.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veritone’s Marvel.AI platform will let celebrities and influencers create AI copies of their voices. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Veritone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HdL4OE"&gt;Recording advertisements and product endorsements can be lucrative work for celebrities and influencers. But is it too much like hard work? That’s what US firm Veritone is betting. Today, the company is launching a new platform called &lt;a href="http://Marvel.AI"&gt;Marvel.AI&lt;/a&gt; that will let creators, media figures, and others generate deepfake clones of their voice to license as they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5PF0A"&gt;“People want to do these deals but they don’t have enough time to go into a studio and produce the content,” Veritone president Ryan Steelberg tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Digital influencers, athletes, celebrities, and actors: this is a huge asset that’s part of their brand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMaAzY"&gt;With Marvel.AI, he says, anyone can create a realistic copy of their voice and deploy it as they see fit. While celebrity Y is sleeping, their voice might be out and about, recording radio spots, reading audiobooks, and much more. Steelberg says the platform will even be able to resurrect the voices of the dead, using archive recordings to train AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdMPkO"&gt;“Whoever has the copyright to those voices, we will work with them to bring them to the marketplace,” he says. “That will be up to the rightsholder and what they feel is appropriate, but hypothetically, yes, you could have Walter Cronkite reading the nightly news again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VgBBkA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/548660025?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8F96tw"&gt;Speech synthesis has improved rapidly in recent years, with machine learning techniques enabling the creation of ever-more realistic voices. (Just think about the difference between how Apple’s Siri sounded when it launched in 2011 and how it sounds &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nkNcb_XNbFI?t=107"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;.) Many big tech firms like Amazon offer off-the-shelf text-to-speech models that generate voices at scale that are robotic but not unpleasant. But new companies are also making boutique voice clones that sound like specific individuals, and the results can be near-indistinguishable from the real thing. Just listen to this voice &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DWK_iYBl8cA"&gt;clone&lt;/a&gt; of podcaster Joe Rogan, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mk2fUv"&gt;It’s this leap forward in quality that motivated Veritone to create Marvel.AI, says Steelberg, as well as the potential for synthetic speech to dovetail with the firm’s existing businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0f8DpS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Veritone places more than 75,000 ads in podcasts monthly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTISOz"&gt;Although Veritone markets itself as an “AI company,” a big part of its revenue apparently comes from old-school advertising and content licensing. As Steelberg explains, its advertising subsidiary Veritone One is heavily invested in the podcast space, and every month places more than 75,000 “ad integrations” with influencers. “It’s mostly native integrations, like product placements,” he says. “It’s getting the talent to voice sponsorships and commercials. That’s extremely effective but very expensive and time consuming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IC3U2l"&gt;Another part of the firm, Veritone Licensing, licenses video from a number of major archives. These include archives owned by broadcasters like CBS and CNN and sports organizations like the NCAA and US Open. “When you see the Apollo moon landing footage show up in movies, or Tiger words content in a Nike commercial, all that’s coming through Veritone,” says Steelberg. It’s this experience with licensing and advertising that will give Veritone the edge over AI startups focusing purely on technology, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4HE5P"&gt;To customers, Marvel.AI will offer two streams. One will be a self-service model, where anyone can pick from a catalog of pre-generated voices and create speech on demand. (This is how Amazon, Microsoft, et al. have been doing it for years.) But the other stream — “the focus,” says Steelberg — will be a “managed, white-glove approach,” where customers submit training data, and Veritone will create a voice clone just for them. The resulting models will be stored on Veritone’s systems and available to generate audio as and when the client wants. Marvel.AI will also function as a marketplace, allowing potential buyers to submit requests to use these voices. (How all this will be priced isn’t yet clear.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cda4ki"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Veritone has yet to prove its AI voices are worth the effort&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6w4A1"&gt;Steelberg is convincing that the demand for these voices exists and that Veritone’s business model is ready to go. But one major factor will decide whether Marvel.AI succeeds: the quality of the AI voices the platform can generate. And this is much less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuEhe0"&gt;When asked for examples of the company’s work, Veritone shared three short clips with &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;each a single line endorsement for a brand of mints. The first line is read by Steelberg himself, the second by his AI clone, and the third by a gender-swapped voice. You can listen to all three below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p9aDeS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Veritone Marvel AI Speech Synthesis|102118" data-volume-uuid="7808acc72" data-volume-id="102118" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-760" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LMlnTJ"&gt;The AI clone is, to my ear at least, a pretty good imitation, though not a perfect copy. It’s flatter and more clipped than the real thing. But it’s also not a full demonstration of what voices can do during an endorsement. Steelberg’s delivery lacks the enthusiasm and verve you’d expect of a real ad (we’re not faulting him for this — he’s an executive, not a voice actor), and so it’s not clear if Veritone’s voice models can capture a full range of emotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpGeHK"&gt;It’s also not a great sign that the voiceover for the platform’s sizzle reel (embedded at the top of the story) was done by Steelberg himself rather than an AI copy. Either the company didn’t think a voice clone was good enough for the job, or it ran out of time to generate one — either way, it’s not a great endorsement of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpAlHO"&gt;The technology is moving quickly, though, and Steelberg is keen to stress that Veritone has the resources and expertise to adopt whatever new machine learning models emerge in the years to come. Where it’s going to differentiate itself, he says, is managing the experience of customers and clients into actually deploying synthetic speech at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EP8l4L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Synthetic content will raise lots of questions about authenticity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LrujA3"&gt;One problem Steelberg offers is how synthetic speech might dilute the power of endorsements. After all, the attraction of product endorsement hinges on the belief (however delusional) that this or that celebrity really does enjoy this particular brand of cereal / toothpaste / life insurance. If the celeb can’t be bothered to voice the endorsement themselves, doesn’t it take away from the ad’s selling power? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3HnbY"&gt;Steelberg’s solution is to create an industry standard for disclosure — some sort of audible tone that plays before synthetic speech to a) let listeners know it’s not a real voice, and b) reassure them that the voice’s owner endorses this use. “It’s not just about avoiding the negative connotations of tricking the consumer, but also wanting them to be confident that [this or that celebrity] really approved this synthetic content,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YscHAv"&gt;It’s questions like these that are going to be increasingly important as synthetic content becomes more common, and it’s clear Veritone has been thinking hard about these issues. Now the company just needs to convince the influencers, athletes, actors, podcasters, and celebrities of the world to lend it their voices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 (15-inch) review: a big-screen entertainment machine</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A Samsung laptop you might actually want&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Z1Pxq4"&gt;Samsung has released a number of Galaxy Books in the last few years. Despite generally being good devices with a recognizable brand name, most of them have remained Samsung-enthusiast purchases; none have truly entered the mainstream conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1ZqVc"&gt;So it seems fitting that the Galaxy Book Pro 360 isn’t a direct sequel to any preexisting Galaxy Books. Instead, it’s an attempt to combine the best features of Samsung’s previous PCs and create a device that Samsung knows it can do really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpp2oP"&gt;It worked. The Galaxy Book Pro 360 is targeting a fairly specific audience, but in two areas — its OLED screen and its three-pound weight — it’s a groundbreaking device that has little significant competition across the market. But what’s really exceptional is that you don’t have to sacrifice much to get those standout features. It’s solid in the other areas that matter, it comes with some neat software and has few significant problems. If there’s a device that could bring the Galaxy Book out of the territory of Samsung super-fans and into the mainstream market, this is it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lxYcBP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10483038"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VjJGYO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10483048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIoe4G"&gt;The 15-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360 starts at $1,299. For the base price, you get a Core i7-1165G7, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. For $200 you can upgrade to the model I’m reviewing, which has 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. The only other difference between these configurations is that the base only comes in “mystic navy” (the color of the unit I have), while the pricier one also comes in “mystic bronze.” There’s also a 13-inch model, starting at $1,399.99, that will support 5G at some point (though it doesn’t yet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tX3e8Q"&gt;That’s competitive pricing. The Galaxy Book Flex, Samsung’s most recent ultraportable touchscreen convertible, has an MSRP of $1,399 for an 8GB / 512GB model (though it’s often on sale now). Comparable Surface Laptop 4 and Surface Pro 7 Plus models start at $1,499 at the lowest. All Galaxy Book Pro 360 models also ship with an S Pen, which is just like the S Pen on the Galaxy Book Flex except that it’s 2.5 times thicker. As I noted in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;initial look at the Book 360&lt;/a&gt;, it really does feel like a real pen (especially compared to the S Pens that you get with Galaxy Note phones, which feel like toys in comparison), though I wish there were somewhere in the chassis to store it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 (15-inch) in tablet mode, seen from the right side, with the stylus on top. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MuiUvfrsnodZZkRCuOogZwJndY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513596/akrales_20210513_4572_0164.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All I want is a garage, Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 (15-inch) in tablet mode with the stylus below it on a white table. The screen displays a purple pastel pattern on a dark background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BSwofcCjvplbT0D5mUKE_3panOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513597/akrales_20210513_4572_0174.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two buttons on the pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RdmMtL"&gt;The quad-core Core i7-1165G7 is the same processor that powers a number of the best consumer laptops on the market. The Pro 360 was just fine for the large load of Chrome tabs and apps that I pushed it through during each day of testing. Performance was snappy, and I rarely heard the fans spin up (though I occasionally heard coil whine from the processor). Note that there’s no discrete GPU option, but Iris Xe graphics can lend a hand in some lightweight gaming and graphic work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKDonZ"&gt;Then, there are a number of customization features that you can tweak in the Samsung Settings app. You can swap between cooling profiles, including a “no fan” mode if you want total silence. You can toggle “Studio Mode,” which is supposed to enhance your video quality on calls — while it wasn’t night and day, I did find that this made me look a bit better in low-light settings. One feature I didn’t love was Secret Screen, which purports to be a privacy screen but really just makes the app you’re using either translucent or darker (and it doesn’t work with every app). Maybe this makes it slightly harder to snoop, but it also makes work an odd experience, and you could achieve a similar effect by just dimming your screen. I’d invest in a laptop with a real privacy shield (such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP’s Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt;) if you’ll be viewing highly sensitive material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1Wh8y"&gt;And then there are some bonuses for folks who are already Samsung devotees: you can expand your display onto a Galaxy Tab S7 or S7 Plus and quickly move files between Galaxy devices with Samsung’s Quick Share function. And the Pro 360 comes preloaded with some Samsung software, including Samsung Notes (which can sync between devices) and SmartThings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aV7mu8"&gt;Most of my (very few) quibbles with the device come from the outside. For one, the blue chassis is a fingerprint magnet (the lid was all smudged up after half a day of use). I also experienced some occasional palm-rejection issues with the touchpad, which improved but didn’t disappear when I bumped it down to the lowest sensitivity. And I know some people like flat keyboards, but this one is too flat for my taste, with just 1mm of travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 (15-inch) open, seen from the back, angled slightly to the left. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0s8sqjivMVjZLM9eWyMSjMA13U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513586/akrales_20210513_4572_0045.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 (15-inch) seen from the right side. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOAtO89R-WdUKgovdZH-6MCiJhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513588/akrales_20210513_4572_0071.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 (15-inch). The battery indicator light is on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s24M2EyT7JKPH_HhTvnIFZ-Ug60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513587/akrales_20210513_4572_0054.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, have more USB-C. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mGLewY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10483058"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CnZy1a"&gt;But there are a couple reasons why the Galaxy Book Pro 360 really stands out, and they easily make up for those quibbles. The first is the screen. The 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360 will be one of very few 13-inch OLED laptops on the market. OLED is more common in the 15-inch tier, but it’s unusual to see outside of creator-focused workstations with discrete GPUs. The most obvious use for this 15.6-inch OLED panel is likely entertainment, rather than on-the-go creative work. (That’s especially true because it’s just 1920 x 1080 resolution, not 4K.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDnCRq"&gt;The screen is quite sharp, with vibrant colors. (It maxed out our colorimeter, covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut). As we’d expect from an OLED panel, it delivers bright whites and unparalleled blacks. If you’re looking for a 15.6-inch laptop with an OLED display, you’re unlikely to find one at a lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxG5Kf"&gt;That said, there are a few things to note. First, it doesn’t get super bright, maxing out at just 276 nits in my testing. It kicked back some glare outdoors, though I was still able to use it. Second, it’s 16:9, which is an aspect ratio I’ve sworn off forever because it’s cramped for multitasking. And third, there’s some wobble when you type or use the touchscreen. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;worst &lt;/em&gt;wobble I’ve ever seen, but it’s there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1vzgMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10499540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zxoDQQ"&gt;Another standout feature: the Galaxy Book Pro 360 is really darn portable. It’s just a few millimeters thicker than the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (0.46 inches). And at three pounds, it’s easily one of the lightest 15-inch laptops you can buy. The 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 and Galaxy Book Flex, both of which are also known for their lightweight builds, are almost half a pound heavier. I’ve never considered buying a 15-inch laptop myself, due to how much they tend to weigh; this is the first 15-incher I’ve reviewed that I can actually see myself carrying around all day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAYEKn"&gt;The third benefit is one I wasn’t expecting: battery life. This laptop has a 68Wh battery, which isn’t huge for 15-inchers (though it’s bigger than you often see for a 15W processor with integrated graphics). It also has a display that could be a battery suck. Samsung’s last attempt at an OLED laptop had disappointing battery results. So I was pleasantly surprised by how long the Galaxy Book Pro 360 lasted. I averaged 10 hours and 23 minutes to a charge during my testing, which included using around a dozen Chrome tabs and some apps on the side with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. If you’re just using this for entertainment, and not as a primary work driver, you’ll likely get even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The power button in the top right corner of the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HjKtSn5W055gbDe0Ccu07f1abFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513591/akrales_20210513_4572_0100.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 webcam seen up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fMMTcCMDSH89XWlPR9TdSx9sS7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513589/akrales_20210513_4572_0087.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a 720p webcam and dual microphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azTgSz"&gt;I’m a fan of the 15-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360, though I do think its audience is fairly specific. This is a laptop worth considering if you’re looking for an excellent big-screen entertainment experience while you’re out and about, and maybe also need to take notes for class or make artwork in your spare time. Bonus points if you’re already plugged into the Samsung ecosystem. Not everyone needs that kind of laptop — but if you do, this is a good one to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Cjidl"&gt;The device’s weight is a huge benefit, but what’s even more impressive is that you’re not sacrificing a lot to achieve that weight. You also get a premium build, a capable processor with plenty of RAM and storage, a decent port selection, a nice screen with stylus support, and all-day battery life, all for a competitive price. What ultimately makes this laptop worth its price is that the lightweight chassis is icing on the cake — it’s not a feature you have to compromise on a ton of other things to get.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AKffcX"&gt;If you’re a Samsung fan who hasn’t been sold on the Galaxy Book lineup so far, I’d say this is the one to get. I wish the hinge were sturdier, I wish the keyboard wasn’t quite so flat, and I wish the screen got a tad bit brighter. But I don’t see any of those things significantly hindering the overall experience. For once, Samsung has made a tough 2-in-1 to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft rolls out Dolby Vision gaming test on Xbox Series X and S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qFDronbxfYN7_Z0zTDr4PUrJ60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286203/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CR6PVN"&gt;Dolby Vision gaming is arriving on the Xbox Series X and S for testers who are a part of the Xbox Insider’s “alpha ring” group. This HDR format offers an upgraded set of features like support for dynamic metadata. Microsoft says the feature means “brighter highlights, sharper contrast, and more vibrant colors” in games when you’re playing on a Dolby Vision-compatible TV, offering “better clarity in both light and dark scenes.” The consoles currently support HDR via the less advanced HDR10 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSB8eZ"&gt;We’ve known Microsoft’s current generation of Xboxes would support Dolby’s HDR standard since before the consoles’ release. Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.whathifi.com/news/xbox-series-x-the-first-games-console-with-dolby-vision-hdr-and-atmos"&gt;Dolby announced&lt;/a&gt; that they’d be “the first consoles to support the Dolby Vision HDR format with dynamic metadata for gaming.” Sony’s PS5, meanwhile, currently does not support Dolby Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2PeHVx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Get ready to transform your gaming experience with full-spectrum visuals! Rolling out to Xbox Insiders this week: Dolby Vision for gaming on Xbox Series X|S. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iU2RktHvPG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iU2RktHvPG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Larry Hryb   ☁ (@majornelson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/1393181830149558276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H83ey3"&gt;As well as improvements in picture quality, Microsoft says Dolby Vision support should be easier to configure for users. “Dolby Vision games automatically map to any display with Dolby Vision, you’re always seeing the best possible picture available,” the company says. “This means … no more sliders to adjust your picture settings.” However, it advises that testers might need to update their TV’s firmware to take full advantage of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFyOnF"&gt;During an earlier test of the feature in March, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2021/03/20/xbox-series-x-and-s-start-receiving-dolby-vision-gaming-upgrade/?sh=6f4e2de710a7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that users reported that all HDR games appeared to be outputting in Dolby Vision, rather than needing to specifically support the upgraded format. However, it’s unclear if this will be the case when the feature officially releases. As part of today’s announcement, Microsoft said it will be sharing more about the games that will take “full advantage” of the standard “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcvmu6"&gt;An earlier limited test of the feature got a positive reception. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2021/03/20/xbox-series-x-and-s-start-receiving-dolby-vision-gaming-upgrade/?sh=6f4e2de710a7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says alpha testers reported improvements to brightness, black levels, and color saturation in HDR games. At the time the feature seemed to be limited to 60Hz, but &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2021/05/13/is-xbox-series-x-dolby-vision-gaming-about-to-give-even-cutting-edge-tvs-another-big-headache/?sh=37d5b75f5896"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; has more recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that Dolby is working with TV manufacturers to enable the standard to work at 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5pZEH"&gt;In order to benefit from the feature, your TV will need to be Dolby Vision-compatible, as an increasing number of 4K TVs now are. But always be careful and check your specs. For example, Samsung — the largest TV manufacturer globally — doesn’t support the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVoHiN"&gt;Microsoft didn’t provide a timeline for when it expects the feature to roll out to everyone, noting only that it will be available “once we’ve completed testing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google files legal brief to protect work program for immigrant spouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnkX2F2t1euUpKYA8rRSf5ZGfMU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69285794/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7baOO"&gt;Google has filed an amicus brief to protect a program that allows the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the United States. The brief has been signed by numerous tech giants including Apple, Amazon, Twitter, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRERgY"&gt;The tech industry has long relied on foreign talent to fill the gaps in its workforce. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/business/dealbook/h1b-visas-us-jobs.html"&gt;Google and Amazon were among the top sponsors of H-1B visas&lt;/a&gt;, which are reserved for highly skilled workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWfyfG"&gt;Under President Trump, the program came under fire. The former president drastically boosted denial rates of H-1B applications, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/plan-to-ban-tens-of-thousands-of-h-4-visa-spouses-from-work-is-killed-by-biden-administration/"&gt;as reported by the &lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He also went after H-4 visas, which are reserved for the spouses of people with H-1B status. Trump threatened to ban H-4 visa holders — a group that is 90 percent women — from working in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C5hmOs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ability for people with H-4 visas to work is still under threat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BNrG9v"&gt;While that ban never came to pass, the ability for people with H-4 visas to work is still under threat from a lawsuit against the federal government. The suit, called &lt;em&gt;Save Jobs USA v. US Department of Homeland Security&lt;/em&gt;, was brought by tech workers, who argue that H-4 holders are unfair competition for Americans looking for jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8fuqn"&gt;The case was delayed by President Trump’s proposed ban, which potentially could’ve helped decide the outcome had it passed. Now that the lawsuit is moving forward again, Google and other tech companies want to ensure that the spouses of immigrants maintain their right to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6kGhK"&gt;In its blog post, Google argues that if the program allowing H-4 holders to work were to go away, “the practical effect is that we welcome a person to the U.S. to work but we make it harder for their spouse to work.” It says that it would hurt not only immigrant families, but Google’s ability to hire top talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0o5NS"&gt;“As an immigrant myself, I have been the beneficiary of a welcoming America and I hope we can ensure that same welcome for future immigrants by preserving the H-4 EAD program,” wrote Catherine Lacavera, vice president of Google’s legal department, in the blog post. “Ending this program would hurt families and undercut the US economy at a critical moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s20hvO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maker of expensive Japanese toaster gets into smartphone business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Balmuda, the $230 Toaster From Japan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NeCaoMZFTxhN_weahLHvEaIx1uQ=/0x46:4000x2713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69285400/544949442.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZjDnaN"&gt;Balmuda, a Japanese design company known for its stylish appliances, has &lt;a href="https://www.balmuda.com/jp/news/997"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to make a smartphone. There aren’t many details on the device itself yet, but it’ll be a 5G handset that’s expected to be released in November. SoftBank will sell it as a carrier model, while Balmuda will also offer an unlocked version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFJ85s"&gt;In its announcement, Balmuda notes that since the smartphone business is getting increasingly commoditized, the company wants to provide an experience that only it can. However, the actual manufacturing is out of Balmuda’s wheelhouse, so it’s partnering with Kyocera on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AVbR7V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Balmuda’s toaster sells for about $235 in Japan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1ePyZ"&gt;Balmuda has a fairly limited product line for the home including air purifiers, humidifiers, lights, speakers, rice cookers, and so on. Its best known product is a toaster called “Balmuda The Toaster,” which sells for 25,850 yen (about $235, though it’s &lt;a href="https://store.moma.org/for-the-home/kitchen-dining/cookware-kitchen-tools/balmuda-the-toaster/13327.html"&gt;available in the US for $329 through the MoMa Design Store&lt;/a&gt;) and uses steam to ensure your &lt;em&gt;shokupan&lt;/em&gt;, among other things, is perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-03/meet-balmuda-the-230-toaster-from-japan"&gt;Bloomberg reported five years ago&lt;/a&gt; that it had become a cult hit in Japan with a three-month waiting time to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPHwg"&gt;I have the toaster, and while I’m not sure I would necessarily recommend anyone spend $235 or $329 on a toaster, it is a pretty great toaster. The neat design touches everywhere, from the tiny little mug you use to pour in water for the steam to the cute noises it makes when you turn the timer dial, do make me somewhat curious as to what Balmuda could bring to a phone. We’ll let you know when we find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You can probably try Gmail’s new integrated Chat now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P14BxuI2sK11K_SuXYbnHxKOrRo=/0x18:1458x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284576/Mobile_Nav_3x.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sK6iP2"&gt;Google is rolling out the ability to access Chat messages right from Gmail to more iOS and Android users, after introducing it as a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325966/google-gmail-g-suite-chat-rooms-meet-integration-redesign"&gt;for Google Workspace users last July&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/12/new-gmail-chat-turn-on/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It’s still a test feature, so getting access to it can take a bit of work, and it may not be available to your depending on your account settings (my colleagues and I were able to enable it on personal accounts, but not our work accounts). If you can get it working, though, you’ll be rewarded with a new tab at the bottom of the Gmail app, giving you access to your IMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cRr2O"&gt;To enable the feature on iOS or Android, open the side menu and scroll down to Settings. If you have multiple accounts, select the one you want, then look for “Chat (early access)” under General. Flipping the toggle will turn it on (after you restart the app). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myInyqSBw0RxOXNDRES_MLjFxHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513368/IMG_1485.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning on the Chat toggle will give you access to personal and group chats in Gmail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpGmJb"&gt;If you don’t see the Chat option, you may need enable it in the desktop version of gmail first, by going to &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/chat"&gt;https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/chat&lt;/a&gt;, then selecting Google Chat in the Chat menu. After restarting the Gmail app on your phone, the toggle should appear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ElNNixbkurFdVf-bOG5Ktl0KJHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513366/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_5.02.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may have to enable Chat on desktop before you can get it on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nwNraD"&gt;Chat is Google’s replacement for Hangouts, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517929/google-hangouts-chat-messaging-free"&gt;has slowly been moving users away from&lt;/a&gt;. Chat’s also available as a separate app, but if you’re the type of person who doesn’t like having a ton of messaging apps on your phone, having it just exist as a tab in Gmail could be your kind of thing (especially if you live in email all day).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OEtg8em2_F0JhkX-qEMlmNU-O78=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513384/IMG_1484.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty much just like having the chat app, but in Gmail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Epic fights Apple in court by playing Candy Crush</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8aRSHJWu3EzAMytScMEO_0QAso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284564/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Expert testimony continues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ITuW5D"&gt;Sometimes I reflect on my life and wonder where I went wrong, such that I am sitting on a wooden pew in federal court, watching a Google search for &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt; on the display monitor. This is a huge trial with major stakes for tech companies. It is also a crashing bore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMGhIJ"&gt;On the stand is Lorin Hitt, professor of operations, information, and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton, looking uncomfortable behind his face shield. During his direct examination in the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial, Hitt testified that he didn’t think having to access an app like &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; through a browser instead of the app counted as “friction” for the user — and that it certainly was less friction than “real-world” alternatives, such as leaving a convenience store and then crossing the street to go to another convenience store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vFugkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s what is called a ‘fake game.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LKjeSv"&gt;The point of Hitt’s earlier testimony was that game developers “multi-home” games to PC and mobile. He’s Apple’s expert witness, and he is here to convince the judge that being blocked from the App Store isn’t a huge barrier to developers. Epic — whose game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is in fact blocked from the store — has taken Apple to court to show otherwise. And the picture Hitt painted on his direct examination was largely dismissive of Epic’s concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01wGSx"&gt;Epic attorney Yonatan Even, also in a face shield, is now doing his best to blow a hole in Hitt’s testimony. I am doing &lt;em&gt;my b&lt;/em&gt;est to follow a confusing spreadsheet that includes games that Hitt has promised are on both PC and mobile phones. Even begins by pointing out some of these games are not, in fact, available for PC. One game, &lt;em&gt;Words Story&lt;/em&gt;, is listed as available on PC on the document, but does not say this on the developer’s website. In the Microsoft store, a “&lt;em&gt;Words Story&lt;/em&gt;” with the same art exists, but it’s not the same developer. “Sir, this is not the same developer and not the same game, is it?” Even says. “It’s what is called a ‘fake game.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQKGdE"&gt;We go through this tiresome process for several games: &lt;em&gt;Helix Game&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crowd City&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BitLife&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Happy Glass&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Paper.io 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mr. Bullet&lt;/em&gt;. I have never heard of any of these small-potatoes games, which makes them sort of a weird point of comparison for the most popular game in the world. The app developer pages suggest they are not available on PC, despite Hitt’s document to the contrary. Things are getting contentious, and Hitt is beginning to have a hang-dog “Rick Moranis in &lt;em&gt;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&lt;/em&gt;” vibe. Did Hitt double-check the data to make sure it was the same developer across stores? Can he tell the court under oath that a certain app is from the same developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZNdr"&gt; “Can you give the court sworn testimony that you have seen with your own eyes that this game is also available on PC?” Even asks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgUssh"&gt;Hitt can’t guarantee all the games listed in the unintelligible spreadsheet are from the same developer across all platforms, it turns out. He says his team of researchers did the analysis, and he trusts his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6QSD7l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s part of the frictionless process you have envisioned?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afk38L"&gt;Hitt said earlier that he’d identified eight games that let people buy things on the iOS web browser, and then use them in iOS apps; these are identified in the spreadsheet. Epic has complained that this process isn’t good enough — and certainly isn’t ubiquitous. Now, Even raises the “frictionless” process that Hitt had blithely testified to earlier in the day. &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt; is the example Even chooses. We go to the website, and press “install,” where we are promptly sent to the App Store. We tab back to the website. The only possible way to play on the web is on desktop. The Facebook option for &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;, too, is desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2OY4i"&gt;“That’s part of the frictionless process you have envisioned?” Even asks, somewhat sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKfHr8"&gt;We try another game, &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt;, developed by Supercell. We go to Supercell’s FAQ, where it emerges that payment processes are only through Apple’s App Store or Google play. Supercell itself doesn’t keep payment information “And yet you believe that your team managed to go into a website and buy legitimate &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; money and go back to the app? That’s your testimony?” Even asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYZyTk"&gt;Then he twists the knife: The typical user of &lt;em&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a research team, Even observes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rekc5I"&gt;I am terrified we are going to go through all eight apps, but thankfully Even spares us the exhaustion. According to Even, there are three apps that support buying something on the web, then using it in an app: &lt;em&gt; PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and… &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, however, is now banned from iOS.) Does Hitt have any basis to dispute this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="wAWadw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even’s point stands: most of us do not have research teams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5Yz0z"&gt;Hitt says he trusts his team. I am feeling very bad for the team, which has largely been thrown under the bus by Hitt here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLM9Fb"&gt;On redirect, Apple’s Cynthia Richman tries to stop the bleeding. Sometimes developers license games to other developers — which might explain some of the cases where the developers don’t match. Hitt also tells us that Even’s rather brutal examples aren’t typical. Hitt has &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; purchased V-bucks on a mobile browser, he tells us proudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMqFMx"&gt;“It looked pretty difficult given the examples you provided,” says Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. What’s the explanation for why we couldn’t do these things during the cross-examination? Well, Hitt says, there were other links in the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="zh3aNi"&gt;That may very well be true. But Even’s point stands: most of us do not have research teams. I wish I did — I could send them to the trial in my stead and blame them if the work was subpar. Instead, I am personally sitting through excruciating expert testimony. Why am I focusing on this, specifically? It’s the most interesting thing that happened all day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will try to make Ultraman a global name with a new CG movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OKTx786usO9gwN_wH40NG-hdHw=/608x0:3488x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69284392/NetflixUltraman.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qG32Ib"&gt;Netflix announced that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1392951363223441410?s=20"&gt;it’s partnering with Tsuburaya Productions&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href="https://en.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/news/2629"&gt;a new CG &lt;em&gt;Ultraman &lt;/em&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes of bringing the popular Japanese character to an even larger global audience. Ultraman’s never been a household name outside of Japan despite leaving a huge impression &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NG7fAhvUcc"&gt;on popular culture&lt;/a&gt; — the original &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt; series popularized the “giant man in a suit fights people dressed up as monsters in a model city” genre — but Netflix is hoping to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwjEx1"&gt;The new CG &lt;em&gt;Ultraman &lt;/em&gt;film, besides leaving the franchise’s original live action format, will feature a different version of the character and what sounds like a slightly unusual setup for the plot — Ultraman has undergone “dadification”. Per Tsuburaya Productions’ synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aP22fa"&gt;Baseball superstar Ken Sato returns to his home country of Japan to pick up the mantle of Earth-defending superhero &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt;, but quickly finds more than he bargained for when he’s forced to raise the offspring of his greatest foe, a newborn Kaiju. Struggling to balance the roles of teammate and new father, Ken must confront his own ego, his estranged father, and the conniving Kaiju Defense Force to rise up and discover what it truly means to be &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5lPdKG"&gt;The film will be directed by Shannon Tindle, and co-directed by John Aoshima, who previously worked on Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Gravity Falls. &lt;/em&gt; Tindle’s background in animation is diverse, having worked in traditional 2D animation as a character designer on &lt;em&gt;Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends, &lt;/em&gt;and stop-motion animation &lt;a href="https://shannontindle-blog.tumblr.com/post/146715944924/kubo-it-all-starts-with-an-idea-and-then-gets"&gt;as the creator&lt;/a&gt; of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Laika’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12450744/kubo-and-the-two-strings-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kubo and the Two Strings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a character designer/animator on &lt;em&gt;Coraline&lt;/em&gt;. Tindle is also currently the showrunner on the Netflix animated series &lt;em&gt;Lost Ollie.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5XTP91"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My guy stopped by to celebrate the announcement. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N3SDXKL1qq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N3SDXKL1qq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shannon Tindle (@ShannonTindle_1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShannonTindle_1/status/1392964593035608068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W79d1J"&gt;Tsuburuaya Productions CEO Takayuki Tsukagoshi describes the new film project as “the first full-scale endeavor to reach the global market for Tsuburaya Productions,” and with Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;over 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a good chance somebody is going to learn they’re a huge Ultraman fan after watching this film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cons2y"&gt;That’s great for Netflix, because it already has &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80231373"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt; anime series&lt;/a&gt; it can point people at, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1138494971110019072?s=20"&gt;with a second season in the works&lt;/a&gt;. Which is all part of the streaming service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353848/netflix-launch-anime-ragnarok-zeus-resident-evil-streaming"&gt;larger push into the anime space&lt;/a&gt;, right as the competition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;is really heating up&lt;/a&gt;. Dropping a new &lt;em&gt;Ultraman&lt;/em&gt; movie could be great for the character, but ultimately it’s even better for Netflix’s ongoing goal to be your only source of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
