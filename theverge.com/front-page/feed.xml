    <title>Inside the cryptocurrency scam vortex</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lpbuE"&gt;On May 22nd, a crypto finance project called DeFi100 posted a message to its website: “We scammed you guys and you can’t do shit about it. HA HA. All you moon bois have been scammed and you can’t do shit about it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk05mT"&gt;Screenshots of the message immediately went viral on crypto Twitter (always anarchic, easily risible). A popular anonymous crypto-tracking Twitter account called Mr. Whale &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoWhale/status/1396100822245777408"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that DeFi100 had run off with $32 million. Cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-may-have-absconded-with-32m-in-investor-funds"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/people-behind-crypto-protocol-defi100-231952405.html"&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt;, ran with the number. The project owners &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DEFI100/status/1396489770281226244"&gt;denied any foul play&lt;/a&gt;, and it soon became clear the message was a website hack rather than a serious warning — but by then, it was too late. Panic had set in, and the price of the underlying coin was in free fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUWfTV"&gt;“We never stole any funds,” a representative for the project told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “DeFi100 was a very small project, and we were not holding any investors’ funds, so there are no questions of scamming people or running away with their funds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kb9pdg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s little recourse when crypto investments turn out to be scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBL8TO"&gt;DeFi100’s problems are a small part of the picture, but they’re a reminder of the dangers of the ongoing crypto boom. Despite billions of dollars pouring into the space in recent months, there’s still little recourse when investments turn out to be scams. Most importantly, the radical decentralization of the blockchain means there is simply no way to get your money back — and few assurances that an unproven vendor will keep their promises once the transaction goes through. The result is a new gold rush in crypto scams, as speculators seek ever more obscure opportunities and riskier bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwuLJY"&gt;The DeFi100 project’s website is now back online, but rumors persist about what actually happened. Certik, a popular blockchain security leaderboard, does &lt;a href="https://www.certik.org/"&gt;currently list DeFi100&lt;/a&gt; as a “rug pull,” which is a term for a scam where the founders of a project raise investment money and run. (The project owners say a rug pull would be impossible since they never held investor funds.) It’s just one of a string of scams that today’s crypto holders need to watch out for, along with sketchy altcoins, Discord pump-and-dumps, Elon Musk impersonators, and more &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/don-t-blame-crypto-for-ransomware"&gt;malicious forms of cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHj5Ln"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marenaltman?lang=en"&gt;Maren Altman&lt;/a&gt;, a TikTok influencer with over a million followers who creates videos about cryptocurrency and astrology, there are three kinds of risk that crypto holders should be wary of: bad investments, collapsing projects, and outright scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EyliYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subreddits like r/cryptocurrency are awash with accusations of “scam coins”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMDsbB"&gt;The first and most common kind of risk is simple bad investments in obscure coins. Outside of major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are thousands of smaller coins built on the blockchain technology, promising huge rewards if the coin ever comes to prominence. Subreddits like r/cryptocurrency are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=scam%20coin&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1"&gt;awash with accusations&lt;/a&gt; of “scam coins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHbDgO"&gt;“I mean, I’m in a handful of those myself, where it’s just the investment, it was a promise, the development didn’t go through, and I’m still waiting,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8aBYO"&gt;Trying to research obscure altcoins can be confusing for inexperienced traders. Links to cryptocurrency Discord servers often pop up on Twitter, promising an easy pump-and-dump of a smaller crypto coin. Or more confusingly, Twitter bots will accuse Discord servers that don’t exist of pump-and-dumps, hoping to drive up value for a separate coin. But while they promise easy money, the reality is less enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7YqX2"&gt;Another risk is the oftentimes innocent but unfortunate mismanagement of funds. In a bullish crypto market, everyone thinks they have a revolutionary idea involving cryptocurrency. And, obviously, &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-cryptocurrency-sector-is-overflowing-with-dead-projects"&gt;a lot of them don’t pan out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOahDk"&gt;“Things not being clarified, errors in contract, or just a weak link in the development circle,” Altman explained, “leading to mismanagement of money and people not having their investment turn out as expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuJOo8"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cryptocurrency-failures-all-time/"&gt;extremely well-known example&lt;/a&gt; of this was the DAO project. It launched in the spring of 2016 to huge fanfare, only to be completely defunct by the fall of the same year. The project was created by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization and was an attempt to build a venture capital fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Only a month or two in, a hacker &lt;a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao"&gt;found a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in the token’s code and made off with $50 million. Traders started selling off DAO tokens en masse and the price never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0STOrY"&gt;Sometimes this chaos can end in outright fraud. According to the Federal Trade Commission, crypto-based financial scams &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2021/05/cryptocurrency-buzz-drives-record-investment-scam-losses"&gt;are at an all-time high&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the surging interest in cryptocurrency. And the line between well-meaning blunder and crypto Ponzi scheme is blurry. Just ask investors of OneCoin or PayCoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZgDZXe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In 2019, PayCoin founder Homero Joshua Garza was sentenced to 21 months in prison&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CAHnMO"&gt;OneCoin launched in the mid-2010s and was billed as an educational crypto trading service. It turns out the OneCoin tokens being purchased by investors &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/4b-ponzi-scheme-onecoin-and-cryptoqueen-leader-found-in-default-in-us-lawsuit"&gt;weren’t actually on the blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. It was accused of being a Ponzi scheme and its founders ran off with close to $4 billion. It &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/06/is-onecoin-the-biggest-financial-fraud-in-history/"&gt;has been called&lt;/a&gt; one of the biggest financial scams in history. One of its founders, Ruja Ignatova, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84"&gt;is still missing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVXyiY"&gt;In 2019, PayCoin founder Homero Joshua Garza &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/cryptocurrency-fraudster-sentenced-021119"&gt;was sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution after he created his own cryptocurrency and offered it to investors with the assurance that he had secured a $100 million reserve of capital. There was no reserve, and the whole project &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoManiaks/crypto-scams-like-pay-coin-will-you-be-their-next-victim-medium-a8f6575daff8"&gt;ended up losing $9 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQDUX2"&gt;But even with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-31/roshun-patel-on-what-really-happened-during-the-crypto-market-crash"&gt;May 2021’s sizable dip&lt;/a&gt; in value for big coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cryptocurrency is more popular than ever, and legions of inexperienced traders are learning the hard way what a peer-to-peer financial service actually means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiSBl2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajKA"&gt;Neeraj Agrawal&lt;/a&gt;, the director of communications for Coin Center, one of the US’s biggest cryptocurrency advocacy groups, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that wildly speculative coins (known colloquially as “shitcoins”) are now a permanent part of the cryptocurrency space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLWsZT"&gt;“The insane speculative garbage coins are not going to go away,” Agrawal says. “That’s just part of the world now. And it sort of remains to us to show that the really good projects are worth their existence, that there is actual value here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6TEpW"&gt;That’s particularly hard when crypto celebrities like Elon Musk are driving interest toward the wackier end of the crypto space. Musk recently fueled the massive spike in interest around Dogecoin, a failed crypto coin invented as a joke that’s named after the famous Shiba Inu meme. Musk’s tweets have also been blamed for &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/24/investing/elon-musk-bitcoin-dogecoin-tesla/index.html"&gt;this month’s massive market downturn&lt;/a&gt;. It’s &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/experts-answer-how-does-elon-musk-affect-crypto-space"&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; what effect Musk has on the market, but his recent branding as the main character of crypto has led to a litany of Musk-themed scams. According to the FTC, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/elon-musk-impersonators-stole-more-than-2-million-in-crypto-scams-.html"&gt;people impersonating Musk&lt;/a&gt; have managed to scam at least $2 million from traders this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KEe0bK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A market really only requires two things ... a seller and a buyer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78vEIL"&gt;“Maybe that’s the biggest risk to crypto users — your own stupidity,” joked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem"&gt;Meltem Demirors&lt;/a&gt;, the chief strategy officer of digital-asset investment firm CoinShares. “I think people just aren’t accustomed to taking responsibility for their financial lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqjBBX"&gt;In fact, I was asked by both a family member and a close friend this month about an obscure cryptocurrency called Dogelon Mars. It’s currently worth $0.00000016 USD, but the two people close to me were considering buying a bunch of it because they mistakenly believed that, due to the name and its frankly &lt;a href="https://dogelon.io/"&gt;confusing description&lt;/a&gt;, it was a coin launched by Musk himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pf04S"&gt;Demirors told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Dogelon Mars was actually one of her favorite meme coins. “We have to remember, right, the whole point of a lot of this is permission-less financial innovation,” she says. “And a market really only requires two things. It requires a seller and a buyer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPjMuM"&gt;She said this was the main explanation behind the recent NFT explosion. People had crypto coins on hand and wanted to see what they could spend them on. Turns out what they wanted to buy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;surreal internet art&lt;/a&gt; for millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLLA76"&gt;“I always think it’s really funny when people are all about crypto and permission-less financial innovation, but then the minute they lose money, they become like the most statist people imaginable,” Demirors said. “You really can’t have it both ways. Like you bought this shitcoin. You now need to make your bed and lie in it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the Summer Game Fest’s ‘Kickoff Live’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YICq9gnIIpn96EkLdl644mEgG4M=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433303/E3JlJZNVcAE73j6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Summer Game Fest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRI49d"&gt;Summer Game Fest 2021, hosted by Geoff Keighley, is getting started with new game announcements two days ahead of E3 2021 with its “Kickoff Live” event. In addition to news, it’s perhaps the only event to feature both an appearance from Jeff Goldblum and a musical performance by Weezer. The list of partners for the preview event includes 2K, Activision, Blizzard, Capcom, InnerSloth, Epic Games, Sony PlayStation, Riot Games, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Microsoft Xbox, and more. Here’s how to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Jv5JaK"&gt;When does Summer Game Fest start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HTaFNL"&gt;The kickoff show is happening this Thursday, June 10th at 2PM ET / 11AM PT / 6PM GMT. And like last year’s happenings, it’s all online, so you can just hang out at home and watch all of the announcements from your PC, phone, or TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q22D1o"&gt;Like last year, there will likely be more Summer Game Fest events throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1mF4aA"&gt;Where can I stream Summer Game Fest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SVbwU1"&gt;This game event is being hosted on several platforms, giving you plenty of options. It’s being livestreamed on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MqXeohrnoaY"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (we’ve embedded the video above that’ll go live later), as well as &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s 4K HDR-ready Ultra is $69 at multiple retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dItJtJBQeXgB-WI7FWGvo0w3rqM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433154/45C359B1_1BB2_40B0_923A_5ADB95641327.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7i9EF"&gt;The Roku Ultra 4K HDR streaming device is $30 off at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?subId1=VergeDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-Ultra-2020-Streaming-Media-Player-HD-4K-HDR-Dolby-Vision-Dolby-Atmos-Bluetooth-Streaming-Voice-Remote-Headphone-Jack-Personal-Shortcuts-includes%2F901647298&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741643899319516880#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Bluetooth-Headphone-Shortcuts/dp/B08G9TJWW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; today, which drops the price to $69. This is currently Roku’s high-end model, and it apparently has 50 percent more range than the previous model, with a faster quad-core processor that makes channels launch faster. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459599/roku-ultra-2020-announced-features-dolby-vision-wifi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 2020 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; offers 4K playback at up to 60 frames per second, as well as support for Dolby Atmos content and Atmos-ready home entertainment gear. For HDR support, it boasts Dolby Vision and HDR10 compatibility. This device has an ethernet port for the fastest streaming possible in your home, and it includes a wireless remote and a set of earbuds for private listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NG9uSn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10518754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7eAJxw"&gt;Woot is offering a great deal on refurbished AirPods that come with a wireless charging case. These “grade A” units, which Woot says equates to minimal cosmetic damage, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-2-wireless-charging-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost just $110&lt;/a&gt;. This model costs $150 at Amazon, so it’s a good opportunity to save some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zEvcu4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LtvIWo"&gt;Best Buy has the exclusive on a bundle of Razer PC gaming gear that should be a good fit for anyone who needs some new peripherals. Its so-called “Battle Bundle” contains the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BlackShark V2 X&lt;/a&gt; wired gaming headset, the DeathAdder V2 wired gaming mouse (it’s one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my favorite wired models&lt;/a&gt; in terms of comfort), and the Gigantus V2 M mousepad. All of this would usually cost you well over $100, but you &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035704037356033#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can get it for $80&lt;/a&gt;. This deal will last until June 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZOHpl"&gt;Best Buy has discounted &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035822184865453#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many other Razer products&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3T6EA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600204"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBU9zt"&gt;Amazon is still offering a good deal on a one-year subscription to PS Plus, the online service that allows online multiplayer on PS4 and PS5, as well as bringing complimentary games to members each month. Normally $60, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $45 for a digital code&lt;/a&gt; that you can redeem on your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3BFr6h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmDtOGj8X-cvEFj5Nr83hRoQSuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21882950/lcimg_3a46351f_2ba5_4d82_b82a_27f16ac84385.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QoPBgm"&gt;We featured an attractive $70 off deal yesterday on the Apple Watch Series 6. That was for the GPS-enabled model (and it’s still happening), but if you’ve had your eye out for sales on the LTE-ready model, Amazon has one. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B08J628R4C?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 40mm-sized Series 6 in blue costs $400&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This is $30 less than other colors offered at Amazon and Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0t9j0L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The algorithms were used to design an upcoming version of Google’s TPU chips. Pictured above is TPUv2, announced in 2017. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mcDpQb"&gt;Google is using machine learning to help design its next generation of machine learning chips. The algorithm’s designs are “comparable or superior” to those created by humans, say Google’s engineers, but can be generated much, much faster. According to the tech giant, work that takes months for humans can be accomplished by AI in under six hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSOpFP"&gt;Google has been working on how to use machine learning to create chips &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/13/google-ai-chief-jeff-dean-interview-machine-learning-trends-in-2020/"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, but this recent effort — described this week &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w"&gt;in a paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;seems to be the first time its research has been applied to a commercial product: an upcoming version of Google’s own TPU (&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu"&gt;tensor processing unit&lt;/a&gt;) chips, which are optimized for AI computation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9GNTM"&gt;“Our method has been used in production to design the next generation of Google TPU,” write the authors of the paper, led by Google’s head of ML for Systems, Azalia Mirhoseini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvSQmi"&gt;AI, in other words, is helping accelerate the future of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBQeDT"&gt;In the paper, Google’s engineers note that this work has “major implications” for the chip industry. It should allow companies to more quickly explore the possible architecture space for upcoming designs and more easily customize chips for specific workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pqDrj"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01507-9"&gt;editorial in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;calls the research an “important achievement,” and notes that such work could help offset the forecasted end of Moore’s Law — an axiom of chip design from the 1970s that states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. AI won’t necessarily solve the &lt;a href="https://www.technologist.eu/the-end-of-moores-law-reign/"&gt;physical challenges&lt;/a&gt; of squeezing more and more transistors onto chips, but it could help find other paths to increasing performance at the same rate.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s TPU chips are offered as part of its cloud services and used internally for AI research. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ODIaCZ"&gt;The specific task that Google’s algorithms tackled is known as “floorplanning.” This usually requires human designers who work with the aid of computer tools to find the optimal layout on a silicon die for a chip’s sub-systems. These components include things like CPUs, GPUs, and memory cores, which are connected together using tens of kilometers of minuscule wiring. Deciding where to place each component on a die affects the eventual speed and efficiency of the chip. And, given both the scale of chip manufacture and computational cycles, nanometer-changes in placement can end up having huge effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L8aO4Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google compared the challenge of chip design to a board game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MHN0c"&gt;Google’s engineers note that designing floor plans takes “months of intense effort” for humans, but, from a machine learning perspective, there is a familiar way to tackle this problem: as a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOQuFg"&gt;AI has proven &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495548/deepmind-ai-go-alphago-zero-self-taught"&gt;time and time again&lt;/a&gt; it can outperform humans at board games like chess and Go, and Google’s engineers note that floorplanning is analogous to such challenges. Instead of a game board, you have a silicon die. Instead of pieces like knights and rooks, you have components like CPUs and GPUs. The task, then, is to simply find each board’s “win conditions.” In chess that might be checkmate, in chip design it’s computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MflkXW"&gt;Google’s engineers trained a reinforcement learning algorithm on a dataset of 10,000 chip floor plans of varying quality, some of which had been randomly generated. Each design was tagged with a specific “reward” function based on its success across different metrics like the length of wire required and power usage. The algorithm then used this data to distinguish between good and bad floor plans and generate its own designs in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqwFXs"&gt;As we’ve seen when AI systems take on humans at board games, machines don’t necessarily think like humans and often arrive at unexpected solutions to familiar problems. When DeepMind’s AlphaGo played human champion Lee Sedol at Go, this dynamic led to the infamous “&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/"&gt;move 37&lt;/a&gt;” — a seemingly illogical piece placement by the AI that nevertheless led to victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t86Ab0"&gt;Nothing quite so dramatic happened with Google’s chip-designing algorithm, but its floor plans nevertheless look quite different to those created by a human. Instead of neat rows of components laid out on the die, sub-systems look like they’ve almost been scattered across the silicon at random. An &lt;a href="https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-021-01515-9/d41586-021-01515-9_19234272.png"&gt;illustration from &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the difference, with the human design on the left and machine learning design on the right. You can also see the general difference in the image below from Google’s paper (orderly humans on the left; jumbled AI on the right), though the layout has been blurred as it’s confidential:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h60PSDFydysVk6ujis9VNZGD1Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649839/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_1.10.40_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mirhoseini, A. et al&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A human-designed chip floor plan is on the left, and the AI-designed floor plan on the right. The images have been blurred by the paper’s authors as they represent confidential designs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1uLHcE"&gt;This paper is noteworthy, particularly because its research is now being used commercially by Google. But it’s far from the only aspect of AI-assisted chip design. Google itself has explored using AI in other parts of the process like “&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-deep-learning-finds-a-critical-path-in-ai-chips/"&gt;architecture exploration&lt;/a&gt;,” and rivals like Nvidia are looking into other methods to &lt;a href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2020-09_Accelerating-Chip-Design"&gt;speed up the workflow&lt;/a&gt;. The virtuous cycle of AI designing chips for AI looks like it’s only just getting started. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to set up a VPN</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a computer with a wireframe globe on the screen surrounded by question marks and random longitude and latitude coordinates." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZYD7j9rj-AtEBJXj4Cz0WOcpaA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433118/VRG_4614_2_VPN.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sl1apd"&gt;Virtual private networks (VPNs) can offer an additional layer of security and privacy for your online activity. Whether you’re working on a public Wi-Fi network and want to escape prying eyes, or you’re worried about privacy in general, a VPN can offer a lot of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbrixj"&gt;In a nutshell, a VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a private server, hiding your traffic from being seen by others. Of course, the VPN itself can still see your traffic, which is why you should choose a VPN from a company you trust. (A good rule of thumb is to avoid free VPNs, because if they’re not charging you a fee, they may be monetizing in some less desirable way.) In addition, law enforcement can get its hands on your information through the VPN company. However, for the most part, a VPN offers you a way to hide your online activity from others. 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TL2vsV"&gt;Note that getting a VPN is only one of the measures you can take to make your web browsing more secure. Others include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/17/15772142/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication"&gt;enabling two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;using a password manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pKQ3p"&gt;In addition to their security benefits, VPNs can be handy when you’re trying to access sensitive information, or if you’re traveling in Europe and want to stream &lt;a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/bypass-vpn-blocks/"&gt;Netflix or Amazon Prime titles only allowed in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Some even claim they can allow you to jump firewalls in heavily regulated countries &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-vpn-for-china-our-5-top-choices"&gt;such as China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DhrA8B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In addition to their security benefits, VPNs can come in handy when you’re trying to access sensitive information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQTM4G"&gt;At home, you can set up your VPN through your router, which takes a few more steps, but then any devices connected to your router won’t need to be configured individually; this can also slow down all traffic that goes through. However, for this article, we’re going to concentrate on VPN apps that you can load on your laptop or phone so you can use the internet safely while away from your home base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdiRVh"&gt;Most VPN apps these days support the OpenVPN protocol, making setup a simple matter of allowing the app access to configure the settings for you. But whether your device uses macOS, Chrome OS, Windows 10, iOS, or Android, if you’d like a quick overview of what’s involved before selecting a service, or if you prefer to do a manual setup, we’ve broken down the steps into straightforward instructions for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qx1SYC"&gt;Setting up a VPN in Windows 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nQoH8W"&gt;The first step is to create a VPN profile, which you’ll fill out with details from your particular VPN service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Add a VPN profile in Windows 10." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/53Xw6LZvIDjn90hDLsVwcMDvims=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540915/windows_10_vpn.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add a VPN profile in Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Mdlj8R"&gt;Click on the Windows button, then head into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Network &amp;amp; Internet” &amp;gt; “VPN.” Click on “Add a VPN connection.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MSgkCB"&gt;In the fields on the menu, select “Windows (built-in)” for your VPN provider. Give your VPN a name under “Connection name.” Enter the server name or address, the VPN type, and the type of sign-in info, such as a username and password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XMDXSP"&gt;Click “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rqiVht"&gt;To connect to your VPN, go back to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Network &amp;amp; Internet” &amp;gt; “VPN.” Click on your VPN name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HqiYlb"&gt;If you want, you can select “Advanced Options” to edit the connection properties, clear your sign-in info, or set up a VPN proxy. You can also add a username and password in this section for extra security (optional, but recommended).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ijItHq"&gt;Select “Connect” and enter a password if you’ve set one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hC4Hsp"&gt;Setting up a VPN in Chrome OS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BmsEld"&gt;While using a VPN with a Chromebook used to be a problem, these days, there are several (like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Fvpn-software%2Fvpn-chromebook&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22454548%2Fvpn-set-up-how-to-macos-ios-windows-chrome-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ExpressVPN&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nordvpn.com/download/chromebook/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordVPN&lt;/a&gt;) that have versions specifically for Chrome OS. To get started, you can head to the Google Play store and get the VPN app from there, or download one from the VPN’s website. No matter which you choose, after opening your VPN app, it should prompt you with instructions on how to fully set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MMH3f"&gt;If you need to do it manually, you can. Chrome has native support for L2TP / IPsec and OpenVPN. To install a VPN that works with one of these formats:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Chrome OS has native support for L2TP / IPsec." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AtqiOpw6wqrbuX1IyH7xUZ9qbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14811441/Screenshot_2019_02_28_at_9.22.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS has native support for L2TP / IPsec.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="87v8G5"&gt;Click on the time in the lower-right corner of your screen, then click on “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UziYyp"&gt;Click on “Add connection” and then on “OpenVPN / L2TP.” (You may also find the name of your VPN in the “Add connection” list, which will make things easier.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SwBOhF"&gt;Add all of the necessary information, which may include server hostname, service name, provider type, pre-shared key, username, and password. You can save your identity and password if you like. When finished, click on “Connect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="H5V3bZ"&gt;Some VPNs, especially those issued from a workplace, demand a certificate, which you will need to import first. If that’s required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cdvMRr"&gt;Enter &lt;em&gt;chrome://settings/certificates&lt;/em&gt; into the address bar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NuvljE"&gt;Go to the “Authorities” tab. Find the correct certificate in the list and click “Import.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9XkvxJ"&gt;Then follow the instructions above for setting up the VPN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JIkZYV"&gt;Setting up a VPN in macOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S0hKuc"&gt;As with the other formats here, there are apps that automatically guide you through the setup process, but you can also do it yourself manually. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the drop-down menu and choose “VPN” so you can enter your VPN’s details." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UrNrwPKX5Naup6ndGxvsxsPCmZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14749608/Adding_a_VPN_to_macOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the drop-down menu and choose “VPN” so you can enter your VPN’s details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="30rO70"&gt;To start, head into “System Preferences” and then choose “Network.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iIyIUh"&gt;From there, the process is straightforward. Click the Plus-symbol button on the bottom left, and use the Interface drop-down menu to choose your VPN. You’ll need the details from your VPN of choice to fill out “VPN Type” and “Service Name.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ky7Lr6"&gt;Click on “Create.” Fill out the server address, remote ID, and local ID in the appropriate fields. Then click on “Authentication Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tv0iql"&gt;Enter the username and password for your VPN, which you can set through your VPN app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Otp8Yx"&gt;Click “OK” and then “Connect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y3sXRr"&gt;Setting up a VPN in iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sWbL1W"&gt;Setting up a VPN on an iOS device is fairly simple. Again, if you download an app from the App Store, select it and it should guide you through configuration. Here’s how to do it manually, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s not hard to add a VPN configuration." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZ9nrOXjOGOYrR5OKDRC4zzhVUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14809914/Image_from_iOS__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not hard to add a VPN configuration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This is also where you can delete the VPN." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDkJ28Itk7D-QzOBFRJuco9uqp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14810233/Image_from_iOS__7_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is also where you can delete the VPN.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ukfc0z"&gt;Just head into “Settings” and tap on “General.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsRuSs"&gt;Scroll down to select “VPN.” (The iPhone will indicate whether you are currently connected to one or not.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MTpcTr"&gt;Tap on “Add VPN Configuration” and then on “Type” to select a security protocol. (Follow the instructions provided by your chosen app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CZUpyk"&gt;Go back to the “Add Configuration” screen, where you will add the VPN’s description, server, remote ID, and local ID. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yvEHHN"&gt;Enter your username and password. You can also use a proxy if you like. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="K5zWRk"&gt;Tap “Done.” You will then be brought back to the VPN screen. Toggle the “Status” switch to on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iyHV2p"&gt;Setting up a VPN in Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WFS2S5"&gt;As with iOS, setting up a VPN on an Android device shouldn’t be too difficult. Here’s the manual process if you’re not letting an app automatically configure things for you. (Keep in mind that, because some vendors like Samsung tweak their Android versions, your process may vary slightly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Since this is Android, your setup menu may vary." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6uBuBcw3Tvk-buJCJbCqBxcxhtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14811246/Screenshot_20190228_090212.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since this is Android, your setup menu may vary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Just hit “OK” and you’ve got a VPN." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMNlHdN1FiHnkYaEaNasrxWvvOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14811258/Screenshot_20190228_091122.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just hit “OK” and you’ve got a VPN.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RPsKfy"&gt;Head into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Network &amp;amp; Internet” &amp;gt; “Advanced” &amp;gt; “VPN.” If you don’t see “Network &amp;amp; Internet” in the Settings menu (which may depend on your Android overlay), then do a search within Settings for VPN. Press the “Add” button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7DjO5Q"&gt;If you happen to be setting this up on a new phone, or if you haven’t yet set a screen lock or password, Google will prompt you to set one for your phone first. Do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WwKTOn"&gt;Now create your VPN profile. Add the VPN name, type, and server address. Click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="igQ9cV"&gt;You’ll be taken back to the VPN screen, where you should now see the name of your VPN. Tap on it, and put in your name and password for the VPN. You can also choose to save your account information, and you can optionally set the VPN to be always on. When finished, tap “Connect.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QV6pjk"&gt;Enter the VPN name, type, server address, username, and password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="csZBjy"&gt;Then tap “save.” You’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="9dD7b7"&gt;Once you’ve got your VPN up and running, you might notice that web browsing isn’t as fast as it used to be, especially if you’ve configured traffic to go through another country. Stronger encryption, or more users connected to one VPN, can also slow down your internet speeds. Downloads might slow to snail speed, and your &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; screen lag might be absurd. But those aren’t big problems compared to the security that you’ve added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEZ7V8"&gt;And anyway, now that you know how to set up a VPN, toggling it off is easy in comparison. You just have to remember to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdy0zr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 1st, 2021, 10:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on March 1st, 2019, and now features a few updates related to changes in the Windows 10 interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best features of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that Apple didn’t announce onstage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RtIW8Ta8Q5MlQo_Rx191AoHx8Q=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433094/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;He didn’t tell you everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zj7aSW"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;had its WWDC keynote on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, where it showed off the big new features coming to its platforms, but it didn’t have time to show off everything coming to the new versions of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipados%2Fipados-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;. So we’ve combed through the preview pages, Twitter, and a good chunk of the internet to see what interesting features got left out of the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sHaPRg"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 15&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kLQeaU"&gt;The big features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt; were the updates to notifications, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;, and multitasking, but it appears Apple may have been really focusing on the platforms themselves, too. There are a ton of quality-of-life improvements including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="y7L83k"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-new-memoji-customization-with-over-40-outfits-accessibility-options-more/"&gt;More Memoji options&lt;/a&gt; with new outfits and accessibility options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vlFH2t"&gt;FaceTime will let you know when you’re muted but trying to talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DHMxjY"&gt;FaceTime will also let you zoom with the back camera so you can finally show people things across the room without standing up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0xauwK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210406"&gt;Announce Messages feature&lt;/a&gt; found in AirPods is &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/08/carplay-in-ios-15-announce-messages-with-siri-driving-focus-customization-new-wallpapers/"&gt;coming to CarPlay&lt;/a&gt;, so your phone can automatically read texts out loud while you’re driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2fXplS"&gt;Wary iPhone users will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-will-let-users-stay-on-ios-14-and-receive-security-updates-even-after-ios-15-is-released/"&gt;put off upgrading to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but still get security updates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EFDRkR"&gt;Find My will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-find-my-network-can-find-your-iphone-when-it-is-powered-off/"&gt;track your iPhone when it’s off&lt;/a&gt; (or even after it’s been factory reset). It’s currently unclear what phones will support this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="95Co4f"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1402000042316210184?s=21"&gt;improved print dialog with more options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="O3hVw7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It looks like iOS 15 is dramatically beefing up the print panel — finally &lt;a href="https://t.co/uXaflPoMPe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uXaflPoMPe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1402000042316210184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqXAF0"&gt;You’ll get &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-icloud-storage-temporary-expansion/"&gt;free temporary iCloud storage&lt;/a&gt; when you transfer to a new device, but it will only last for three weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FfNAc8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-leaving-arrival-times/"&gt;Leaving and arrival times are coming to Apple Maps&lt;/a&gt;, letting you better plan trips in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RDpJIc"&gt;iPhone apps for iPad &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ipados-15-enables-iphone-apps-in-landscape-mode-for-ipad-users/"&gt;will be able to run in landscape&lt;/a&gt;. No more flipping your iPad around when you need to check the one app that is still iPhone only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PcJTi8"&gt;There will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1401979104975540229?s=20"&gt;push notifications to tell you when it’s going to rain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O0ac5f"&gt;You’ll have the ability to schedule HomeKit devices with Siri (for example, asking it to turn on your bedroom lights at 7PM).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hsSOq5"&gt;Safari is getting the pull-to-refresh mechanism found in Mail and many social network apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lTaCMT"&gt;Accessibility settings like text size and contrast will be able to be set on a per-app basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qAUK9S"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WSig/status/1402002152176893954?s=20"&gt;EXIF data&lt;/a&gt; will be available in Photos, including camera and lens info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KlHvzQ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1402008820847681536"&gt;You’ll also be able to adjust a photo’s date and time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TlxFLO"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-apple-tv-remote-photos-more/"&gt;redesigned software Apple TV remote&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new hardware version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="EihJ7m"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OP1kBm"&gt;Panoramas taken on iPhone 12s should have less distortion, and moving subjects should look better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4XNKR"&gt;You’ll be able to suggest to Photos that &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/ios-15-photos-now-lets-you-mark-people-places-and-dates-to-suggest-less-often-as-featured-images/"&gt;specific subjects shouldn’t show up&lt;/a&gt; in places like the Photos widget or Memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bhb6cg"&gt;Spotlight will be accessible from the lock screen and Notification Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BzNLM6"&gt;Filtering for spam texts... &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15s-new-sms-spam-filtering-feature-is-limited-to-brazil-heres-why/"&gt;if you live in Brazil, that is&lt;/a&gt;. It’s likely rolling out there because of rampant spamming of SMS in the country — India &lt;a href="https://english.jagran.com/technology/ios-14-6-amazing-indiaspecific-features-that-will-give-your-iphone-a-desi-touch-10016836"&gt;got the feature last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Us6c4"&gt;You’ll be able to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1401999674899419143?s=20"&gt;drag and drop files&lt;/a&gt; across apps on iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="NW7x6z"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Using cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WWDC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1RbyPBGfcq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1401999674899419143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QH7fzN"&gt;Spanish speakers will be able to choose whether their devices refer to them using masculine, feminine, or neutral words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YvI4La"&gt;Mail is getting a widget, and there’s also a widget to show you how poorly you slept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dovXS1"&gt;iPads are getting the ability to tab through text fields and buttons in apps, as can be done with Macs and in Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BkDWeM"&gt;iPads will support eye-tracking hardware to improve accessibility by letting people control a cursor using just their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YXGdxJAma4n1f-mA9noGM0NiDPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22648627/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oNzzVp"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="NownQt"&gt;The Monterey portion of the keynote was dominated by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;incredibly impressive demo&lt;/a&gt; that showed off Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple also took the time to discuss Shortcuts, which are coming to macOS. Macs are complex machines, though, and there are a few more fun and useful things that will be coming in the fall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nmoqSf"&gt;The ability to use your Memoji &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dyountmusic/status/1402433116959084545?s=20"&gt;as your user profile picture&lt;/a&gt; (it’ll even shake its head if you try to log in with the wrong password). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="2b6QvW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5YcMBxrb25"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5YcMBxrb25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Yount (@dyountmusic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dyountmusic/status/1402460588165435394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FjOpT8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-macos-monterey-privacy-features/"&gt;software microphone indicator light&lt;/a&gt; in the menu to show when an application is listening to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YkP81U"&gt;A better file copy interface, with the ability to pause and resume transfers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EPT75"&gt;The easy ability to &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-erase-all-content-settings/"&gt;erase user data, settings, and apps&lt;/a&gt; without re-installing the OS (great for if you’re selling your Mac)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BkvwPu"&gt;The ability to manage your saved passwords in System Preferences. You can also import them from other password managers or export them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KDTUWY"&gt;You can customize the mouse cursor’s outline and fill color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KvxtEv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-automatic-window-resizing/"&gt;Windows will resize&lt;/a&gt; when you move them to another monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oNmXPz"&gt;Shortcuts will let you integrate shell commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FE5yGR"&gt;An improved Go To Folder dialog in Finder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWjwsfwk1AQ4BA3fbd3-SuYkPPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643104/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_6.22.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E62K7I"&gt;And everything coming to... everything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="uPCoCx"&gt;Of course, Apple is running an &lt;em&gt;ecosystem&lt;/em&gt; here, so many of the features that got announced will be coming to all of its computers. Here are a few more that will also be coming to iPhones, iPads, and Macs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="z0zH2z"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-ipados-15-and-macos-monterey-gain-built-in-two-factor-code-generator-and-autofill/"&gt;A built-in one-time password generator&lt;/a&gt;, similar to Google Authenticator or Authy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="spmEQM"&gt;Safari will detect if websites can support HTTPS and will automatically use it if they do (similar to the HTTPS Everywhere extension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hXX12H"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/macos-monterey-low-power-mode/"&gt;A low power mode&lt;/a&gt; for macOS and iPad (I can’t wait to see how far I can stretch an M1 MacBook Pro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BtN5pt"&gt;Reminders are also getting a tags feature, similar to the one found in Notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="THeoMs"&gt;The Photos info pane will tell you about what Visual Look Up sees in the picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZdmzFX"&gt;The ability to turn on DownTime whenever, if you really need to focus on something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FhPxUi"&gt;An extension for Edge on Windows that lets you use your iCloud Passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfdVWLoOXSu2H8CfebLsVTOgAMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643282/lcimg_13fd8fbd_fc86_4ecd_bfd1_7d9df4b29e09.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RTxMUm"&gt;Wait, you forgot WatchOS 8!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3W4Tbk"&gt;Well, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;showed off pretty much everything for WatchOS&lt;/a&gt; onstage — it looks like it’s not a big year for the wearable (but I’ll be very happy to get better always-on display support and multiple timers). There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?s=20"&gt;some new time complications, though&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uu3swa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just noticed there is a new set of Time complications in watchOS 8.  While a slight bit of ‘Sherlocking’ for Watchsmith, I’m honestly super glad it’s here.  A good number of my gray hairs came from supporting time based complications…glad I can focus elsewhere now. &lt;a href="https://t.co/q44aVDMoZh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q44aVDMoZh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Smith (@_DavidSmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ypA0js"&gt;
&lt;p id="oQWKbQ"&gt;If you want to know if you’ll be getting these features, we’ve laid out which devices the new OSs will be coming to here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6n1jJx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the devices that can run iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The best wireless earbuds to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/96fQEVd0sldTjJqJpzgnZoZrsug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67005648/DSCF4082_Edited.7.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking for an everyday pair or something for fitness, these are the best picks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="96Mp4M"&gt;The true wireless earbuds market has never been more crowded than it is in 2021. With so many to choose from, finding the best Bluetooth earbuds can seem daunting. But the vast selection is actually a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing: not only are there excellent picks for everyday buds to carry in your pocket, but you’ve also got a slew of options that prioritize things like noise cancellation, fitness, lengthy battery life, and comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktn8kt"&gt;Even if you don’t consider yourself any kind of audiophile, it’s important to find a set of earbuds that sound good to you. This means different things depending on the person: do you want head-rattling bass or something more balanced with an immersive soundstage? You’ll want to find a pair with a good, reliable Bluetooth connection — all of the below picks check off that box — and enough battery life to last you through a normal day of intermittent listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZpkO2"&gt;Remember that getting the most out of earbuds requires a good seal in your ear. Always try the various ear tip sizes that come with whichever buds you purchase — and don’t be afraid to experiment with different sizes in each ear. Ears are funny like that. Many of these earbuds have apps you can install on your phone to further personalize their sound and controls the way you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c35LSu"&gt;If you’re looking for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds, you’ll be thrilled with Sony’s WF-1000XM4. They have best-in-class noise cancellation, terrific sound quality, and set a new bar for battery life in the category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PcI69T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tVD5bj"&gt;But if you’ve got other priorities, there are a range of great options from Apple, Beats, Jabra, Sennheiser, and Ultimate Ears that won’t disappoint. This guide covers higher-end wireless earbuds.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4 are the best wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HtRCZy"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f3y5ZM"&gt;Best noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pflRtJ"&gt;Two years after releasing its first set of true wireless earbuds, Sony has returned with the redesigned WF-1000XM4. Now smaller and with an IPX4 water resistance rating, the new buds have the most impressive noise cancellation among all competitors — and they still sound phenomenal. Sony also includes memory foam ear tips that offer excellent noise isolation even before the noise cancellation kicks in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4WV6c"&gt;Battery life is another area where the 1000XM4s set a new bar: they can last for up to eight hours of continuous playback with noise canceling turned on, whereas most other NC earbuds top out at around five hours. The case supports wireless charging, and Sony has included its “speak to chat” feature that automatically turns down your audio and enables ambient sound mode when the earbuds detect that you’re talking out loud. Microphone performance remains the weakest aspect of the 1000XM4s, but it’s totally passable if you’re making calls at home. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds are another top pick for noise-canceling earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zOp8wQ"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2AHitr"&gt;Runner-up noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JzPVlZ"&gt;The QuietComfort Earbuds offer very powerful active noise cancellation, but what’s equally nice about them is how customizable the ANC is. You can choose between 11 different levels of noise cancellation (based on how much of the outside world you want mixed in) and set three favorites to cycle between when you double-tap the left earbud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UpL5pM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a6H0xo"&gt;Bose’s premium earbuds put out fantastic audio with punchy bass. Their transparency / ambient mode is second only to Apple in how natural it sounds. And even the voice mics work well, so you really get the whole package — as you should for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mJvWk3"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoImjVffX9jdJWFz3a6hi6zh48E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509971/DSCF3852_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Echo Buds 2 are the best noise-canceling earbuds for under $150.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Gklh1x"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yWjaq5"&gt;Best noise-canceling earbuds under $150&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TUJLAg"&gt;Even if you never take advantage of their hands-free Alexa capabilities, the second-generation Amazon Echo Buds still offer a ton of other positives for an aggressively low price. The noise cancellation is better than on the original set — even if it can’t measure up to our top picks — and their revamped design makes for a more comfortable fit in your ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SvgvJE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rilgjs"&gt;Sound quality is perfectly good for the price you’re paying, and these earbuds have a vented design like the AirPods Pro to prevent occlusion, which is that plugged-up feeling some people hate. Amazon’s ambient sound mode is also surprisingly natural and works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0t6pa6"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJCYyJb47PApJ-PTdVbfaAx2TaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336097/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners because some of their best features only work with other Apple products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ht0eFb"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QpmRPm"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for the iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lNbhRr"&gt;There’s no beating the interplay between AirPods and Apple’s other devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The AirPods Pro don’t offer the best sound quality of our top picks, but it’s perfectly satisfactory to many people. And the active noise cancellation is right up there with Bose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMXRmM"&gt;But it really all comes together if you’re in Apple’s ecosystem and also own a Mac or iPad. The AirPods Pro can automatically hop between devices based on which one you’re using, and on iPhone or iPad, spatial audio delivers immersive surround sound when watching streaming video apps. They’re fantastic for making calls with, and Apple continues to pull ahead of competitors when it comes to ease of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Tv5p"&gt;Here’s a tip: if none of the included ear tips get you a perfect seal, I recommend a set of memory foam tips like those from &lt;a href="https://www.complyfoam.com/products/app-comply-foam-tips-compatible-with-airpods-pro/"&gt;Comply&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1565954-REG%2Fdekoni_audio_etz_app_md3_airpods_pro_tips.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21309820%2Fbest-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dekoni&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods 2 are the best wireless earbuds for making voice calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lWfBYu"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple AirPods&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kxX1hg"&gt;The best wireless earbuds for making voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="O08RZs"&gt;Thanks to their lengthy stems and reliable microphones, Apple’s open-style AirPods remain the best option if you’re someone who frequently makes calls while wearing your earbuds. They’re a dependable performer whether you’re talking to friends on the phone or co-workers on Zoom or Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t2zzJ"&gt;The AirPods provide a seamless, near-instant pairing process when used with Apple devices and also support features like audio sharing, spatial audio, and private listening if you’ve got an Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LglHf0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600152"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p9LG1M"&gt;By the nature of their design, the bass leaves a little to be desired and the AirPods do let in a lot out of outside noise — but some people prefer having that awareness, even if it means cranking the volume up at times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qmAqJ1"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Jabra’s Elite 75t, the best wireless earbuds for multitasking, pictured on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oXb_ij0BVpKkpQxJBn3H62WOqVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19602902/cwelch_200114_3847_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Elite 75t are the best wireless earbuds if you want to pair with two devices simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W40xtb"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uDVgDy"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ukiqM"&gt;Jabra is pretty much the only company making true wireless earbuds that support “multipoint” for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. So you can pair them up with a phone and your laptop or tablet at the same time. Jabra’s mobile app offers a ton of customization over the controls, EQ, and even includes bonuses like white noise or nature sounds if you’ve got situations where they’d be handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h8gk6p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWBz4q"&gt;The newer Elite 85t earbuds add more effective noise cancellation to the mix, but the 75ts are on sale so frequently that they’re still the go-to pick if multitasking is important to you. They pack a wallop when it comes to bass — but not to the point where it overwhelms the rest of the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B4Zz0"&gt;Jabra backs them with a two-year warranty in the event you experience any hardware issues. (I’ve had a 75t bud stop taking a charge out of nowhere, so it can happen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K2kK8C"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Powerbeats Pro earbuds pictured inside their case in someone’s hand." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/USk25QleHuTPa9jKtdful3kutKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16005385/cwelch_190402_3343_1627.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro have been around for some time now, but they still rank as the best earbuds for running.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MMAYVS"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8xKAQg"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for working out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="H4ocO9"&gt;Nothing has managed to unseat the Powerbeats Pro as the best fitness earbuds since their release in 2019. Their ear hook design keeps them planted on your ears during intense exercise, they can endure your sweatiest workouts, and the nine hours of continuous battery life should get you through just about any marathon. And the sound quality is killer, with plenty of bass to keep you motivated and moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QnM1Ez"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386623"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QtSWeK"&gt;And since Beats is owned by Apple, the Powerbeats Pro can also take advantage of features like audio sharing, auto device switching (like the AirPods Pro), and a dead-simple pairing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kRmMjq"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus can last for up to 11 hours on a single charge, which blows away many competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mRgq3W"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KxKFD0"&gt;They can last 11 hours on a single charge. That’s what I consider marathon battery life for true wireless earbuds, and few other companies have managed to keep up with the longevity of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus. They lack active noise cancellation, so that helps them keep playing for longer, but even then, 11 hours is quite a feat. Like the Jabras, these are often on sale and easy to grab at a discount. They make for a good AirPods alternative if you’ve got an Android phone — particularly a Samsung one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N4SqQ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 are the best wireless earbuds in terms of sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qHtoNH"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="17iIUo"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VBO6Vu"&gt;Sennheiser’s second swing at true wireless earbuds improve on the original Momentums with a more comfortable fit and the addition of active noise cancellation. But everything about these earbuds is second fiddle to their sound quality: the Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds put out dynamic, expressive, and wonderfully detailed audio. They’re the sort of buds that will bring out things in your favorite music you haven’t noticed before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdAurp"&gt;But that upgraded sound quality comes for a hefty $300 price. If you want arguably the best sound that true wireless earbuds can deliver, these are it. But all of these other picks sound plenty good in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bd9TxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386636"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re not going to find any silicone ear tips that can match the UE Fits and their custom tips, which mold to match your ear shape in seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ldQHSa"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips"&gt;UE Fits&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4qWQZj"&gt;Best wireless earbuds if comfort is everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq4SD9"&gt;If you often have difficulty finding ear tips that fit your ears comfortably, it doesn’t really get better than the UE Fits. These earbuds include special tips that mold to the shape of your ear during a 60-second fitting process that you activate with UE’s app. They get warm during molding (but not uncomfortably so) and you can feel them adapting to the contours of your ear canal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZxyrc"&gt;Once the process is done, you’re left with custom earbuds with a fit that’s as close to perfect as you’ll ever find — unless you visit your local audiologist for a professional mold, and that gets expensive fast. Ultimate Ears has a fit “guarantee” and will send you a second set of tips should your first molding attempt go awry. The UE Fits are quite good, last for up to eight hours of continuous playback, and they’re rated IPX4 for water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 review: Duet redux</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;You can lean on its kickstand, but not its CPU&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="PPDKkv"&gt;All in all, Asus’ Chromebook Detachable CM3 is a nice package. It’s a 10.5-inch tablet with a magnetically attached fabric cover and kickstand. It’s &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM280000009"&gt;$389.99&lt;/a&gt; as tested, which means it’s priced far below all kinds of convertible Chromebooks. I’m not the first to make this comparison, but it’s a slightly more expensive and slightly fancier version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;$269 Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; (currently listed at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Fstudent-chromebooks%2FLenovo-CT-X636%2Fp%2FZZICZCTCT1X%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22526743%2Fasus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269&lt;/a&gt;) that impressed me so much last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzJjZh"&gt;I think the CM3 is a slightly worse purchase than the Duet for most people who are looking for a secondary device or a small Chromebook for a student. The CM3 does offer a few noticeable benefits over the Duet, but I’m not sure they’re worth $100. While features like a dual-folding kickstand, a garaged stylus, and a headphone jack are nice to have, none of them are as central to a device’s user experience as its processor. And while $269 is an acceptable price to pay for a tablet with a MediaTek chip, $389.99 is pushing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKeGIq"&gt;With all that said, I don’t have many &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt; with this Chromebook. It’s just in a bit of an odd spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jfVlGB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10599304"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VppNpw"&gt;My test unit includes 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, a 10.5-inch 1920 x 1200 display, and a MediaTek 8183 processor. There’s a 64GB version listed at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM280000008/laptopschromebook-ASUS-Chromebook-Detachable-CM3"&gt;$369.99&lt;/a&gt; as well. 64GB isn’t a lot of storage (and there’s no microSD card slot for expansion on the CM3), so my config is the one I’d recommend most people go for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Iwbd"&gt;The most important thing to understand about the CM3 before you buy it is the size. It’s small, with just a 10.5-inch screen. This brings benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, it’s quite slim and portable, at just 0.31 inches thick and 1.1 pounds (2.02 pounds with the keyboard and stand attached). It’s the kind of thing I could easily carry in my purse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 open from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K1zNh5YWec5wp4VCQnyX4ZX-DGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646167/mchin_20190829_4618_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 seen from the right side, open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOMBdNB2tuY2CiRnTT2BbBHfudk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646166/mchin_20190829_4618_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh look, a port!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mF8gOA"&gt;On the other hand, a 10.5-inch screen is cramped for a desktop OS like Chrome OS (though it is bright enough to use outdoors, and I appreciate that it has a 16:10 aspect ratio — 16:9 would be unbearable for me at this size). But it was too small for me to comfortably use as a work driver. I had to zoom out far to be able to see everything I needed to in my Chrome windows.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Csjw10"&gt;It also means there’s only so much space for the keyboard deck, which is also cramped. The touchpad, in particular, is small. The keyboard itself is roomier than the Duet’s, though; it has a surprising amount of travel and a satisfying click. While the small keys are a bit of an adjustment, none are small enough as to be unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWMkV4"&gt;Small doesn’t mean cheap, and the CM3’s build is fairly sturdy overall. The palm rests and detachable keyboard deck feel quite plasticky, but the tablet itself is aluminum (with “diamond-cut edges,” per Asus). The magnetic cover is made of a woven fabric and looks quite similar to the cover of the Chromebook Duet. The cover is included with the price of the CM3, which isn’t the case with some detachables (such as Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;Surface Go&lt;/a&gt; line). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpYkz7"&gt;A USI stylus lives in the top-right corner of the chassis. It’s firmly in there, so you’ll need a nail to tug it out. It’s small and not my favorite stylus I’ve ever used, but it is there and does work. The Duet supports USI styluses, but it doesn’t come with one, so that’s one advantage the CM3 brings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="R7Nq55"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A8VeB5"&gt;The main way the CM3 is unique to other detachables is that its kickstand folds multiple ways. That is, you can fold it the long way when you’re using the tablet like a laptop, or you can flip the tablet vertically and fold the kickstand horizontally. This is a cool feature I haven’t seen before, and it does work. I was never worried about the CM3 falling over in either direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YEo42"&gt;On the other hand, the only real use case I can think of for the horizontal position is video calls where you don’t need to have the keyboard attached and are okay with the camera being on the side of the screen. You can take your own view, but I’d rather use an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; or dedicated tablet for these purposes and have the camera in the right place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Unut"&gt;My unit did have a bit of fraying on the edges of the keyboard deck, which was disappointing to see on a brand-new device, even at this price. The kickstand cover also slipped off the tablet a few times while I was adjusting the height, which isn’t something that ever happened with the Duet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K88PTf"&gt;Speaking of convertibility, the CM3 has a two-megapixel front-facing camera as well as an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera. Both cameras deliver a surprisingly reasonable picture. I wasn’t too washed-out when I did a video call outside, nor was I too grainy in dim light. That said, the dual-camera setup is another cool-sounding feature that probably isn’t the most pragmatic: the rear camera isn’t good enough for actual photography of any kind, and the best use case is probably for snapping pictures of a whiteboard in class. It also takes a few seconds for the CM3 to swap between cameras (it’s not nearly as quick of a swap as it is on an iPhone, for example), so it wouldn’t have saved me a ton of time over just whipping out a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 closed with the camera facing upwards, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HIAwIHjLbXKeee6IXQD6DB99WDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646170/mchin_20190829_4618_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look closely, and you can see the crease running both ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yewsa_OubU2mNW8S6H3eQxQyImI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646169/mchin_20190829_4618_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A magnet at the top of the keyboard attaches to the bottom of the tablet, lifting the deck a bit off the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqMMNz"&gt;The CM3’s MediaTek MTK 8183 is a hybrid chip that’s mainly used in Android tablets. (It’s a different MediaTek chip from the one that was in the Duet last year but is very similar to the one in, uh, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;new Echo Show 8 smart display&lt;/a&gt;.) It’s far from the most powerful processor you can find in a Chromebook, but that’s by design. Battery life is going to be a higher priority for many users who are considering a device as portable as the CM3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PLVaw"&gt;The battery life is, in fact, excellent. I averaged 12 hours and 49 minutes of continuous use running the CM3 through my regular workload of Chrome tabs and Android apps, including Slack, Messenger, Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, and an occasional Zoom call with the screen at medium brightness — over an hour longer than I saw from the Duet with the same workload. This is already a heavier load than many people may want to put the CM3 through, so you may get even more time between charges. The 45W USB-C adapter juiced the CM3 up to 40 percent in an hour, making it much faster than the Duet’s wimpy 10W charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDJ7Gw"&gt;That battery life doesn’t come free, though, and the CM3’s performance was a mixed bag. It works fine in Chrome, for example, albeit with a teensy bit of sluggishness when swapping tabs and resizing windows, as well as other Google services like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet (and it comes with a free 12-month 100GB membership to Google One for the rest of this year). Gaming is also fine. &lt;em&gt;Flipping Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Monsters &lt;/em&gt;were both smooth and stutter-free, regardless of whether the CM3 was plugged in or running on battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="oALc8k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599358"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KHD8PF"&gt;I also think Chrome OS’s tablet mode, which the CM3 supports, has gotten pretty good. It uses Android-esque gesture controls that can help flatten the learning curve for new Chromebook users. Swiping up brings you to the home screen, for example, and swiping right swaps between webpages. You can access a version of Chrome specifically for tablets, which allows you to easily open, close, and reorder tabs with drags, swipes, and large buttons. It’s not quite like using an iPad, but I do think it’s a smoother experience than Windows’ tablet mode (especially in Chrome). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOSsb6"&gt;All you have to do to switch in and out of tablet mode is snap the keyboard on and off. It takes a second, and my windows didn’t always quite go back to the way I’d arranged them when I put the keyboard back on, but it’s a reasonably smooth affair overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPZLTS"&gt;But the CM3 didn’t perform well on every task I needed. Sometimes when I was trying to use Slack or Messenger over a pile of Chrome tabs, something would freeze. Zoom calls were possible — which is more than can be said for some budget Chromebooks — but I did run into lag between audio and video inputs. Slack froze and crashed quite often, and Spotify crashed a few times as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 open, angled to the left. The screen displays a cartoon city scene on a pink background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tMlo3bBVQq_YRwFwa_-FMtTTXgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646164/mchin_20190829_4618_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Access all kinds of Android apps through the Google Play Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nkhPzK"&gt;Photo editing was where I really ran into trouble. Lightroom was basically unusable on the CM3 with just a few things running in the background. I tried to edit a batch of around 100 photos and could consistently only get through a few before the program crashed. I tried to move over to Google Photos, which also eventually crashed and ended up having to do everything in Gallery. Of course, not everyone will be editing photos on their Chromebook or pushing it as hard as I was pushing this one, so it’s a matter of knowing your own needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ec4T45"&gt;Speaking of Zoom meetings, the dual speakers are okay for Zoom calls but not too much more. The songs I played had stronger percussion than I sometimes hear from laptop speakers, but it was thin and tinny overall. The microphone did seem to work well and didn’t have trouble picking up my voice on calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEBaIv"&gt;This was a difficult product to score. I do think the CM3 is a great device. And it does offer a few benefits over the Chromebook Duet that justify it costing a bit more. I’d probably purchase it over the Duet myself for the keyboard alone if I were looking for this type of device. The versatile kickstand, built-in stylus, and decent build quality are nice perks as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hpxXp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CM3 is a great device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzBoOy"&gt;But “if I were looking for this type of device” is doing some heavy lifting in that sentence. I’m not looking for a MediaTek device, and there’s a reason I’m not. The battery life is impressive, sure, but it’s just not enough horsepower for the workload I need. And if you are someone whose needs are suited to this low-powered processor (and there are plenty of these people in the world), I really think $389 is at the very high end of what you should be spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJXA4p"&gt;Sure, the CM3 has a (just okay) stylus, a kickstand with a funky fold, slightly better battery life, and one extra port. But it’s also on par with or slower than the Duet in most tasks I tried, the audio is worse, and it’s thicker and heavier. Given all that, I’m not convinced the CM3’s advantages are worth $100 to most people who are shopping in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Xbox TV app and its own xCloud streaming stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rDtcdMTjb7kH2CSilQyxb7nRUpY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433070/Xbox_Devices_Halo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BSSbjq"&gt;Microsoft is working with TV manufacturers to make an Xbox app available on devices soon. The software giant is planning to bring its Xbox Game Pass service to TVs through its xCloud streaming technology, opening up more ways to get access to Xbox games. This will be available as both an app on TVs, and with Microsoft’s own dedicated streaming stick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjnYUa"&gt;“We’re working with global TV manufacturers to embed the Game Pass experience directly into internet-connected TVs so all you’ll need to play is a controller,” says Liz Hamren, head of gaming experiences and platforms at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JhCz1"&gt;Microsoft isn’t announcing exactly when this Xbox app will be available on TVs, nor which manufacturers will bundle it on their devices. Xbox chief Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612714/microsoft-xbox-app-tv-xcloud-streaming-app"&gt;previously hinted at an Xbox app for TVs&lt;/a&gt; late last year, noting he expects to “see that in the next 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fng262"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft isn’t detailing pricing or release dates for its streaming stick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ROVp4u"&gt;Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529925/xbox-tv-streaming-stick-xcloud-cloud-gaming-phil-spencer-interview"&gt;also hinted at&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s own Xbox streaming stick last year, something Microsoft now says will appear soon. “We’re also developing standalone streaming devices that you can plug into a TV or monitor, so if you have a strong internet connection, you can stream your Xbox experience,” reveals Hamren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayTP2H"&gt;Much like the TV app plans, Microsoft isn’t providing any details on release date or pricing for its own Xbox streaming devices. We don’t even know what they will look like. Microsoft revealed these details in a special press briefing ahead of its E3 event later this week. Microsoft will be focusing on games at its E3 showcase on Sunday June 13th, so it’s unlikely we’ll get any further details until the devices are ready to ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2nVpJ"&gt;This Xbox Game Pass expansion to TVs is part of a broader effort by Microsoft to make its subscription service available beyond just phones and Xbox consoles. Microsoft is also announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291473"&gt;upgrades to its xCloud server blades&lt;/a&gt; today, and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291502"&gt;access and use xCloud on Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo teams up with trucker JB Hunt on autonomous freight hauling in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZ4KA8slElr0IPp3Yk5tnS3Arkw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433013/vpavic_191202_3827_0042.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esi3H9"&gt;Waymo’s autonomous trucking unit got a boost with the announcement that it would be teaming up with JB Hunt Transport Services, a 56-year-old company based in Arkansas. The two companies will work collaboratively on a pilot project to evaluate the use of Waymo’s autonomous technology to move freight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiXnEx"&gt;The test will take place in Texas, with Waymo’s Class 8 autonomous truck hauling goods along Interstate 45 between facilities in Houston and Fort Worth for one of JB Hunt’s customers. The trucks will operate autonomously but will be supervised by two Waymo employees, a commercially licensed driver and a software engineer, from the cab of the vehicle. If everything goes smoothly, Waymo and JB Hunt could decide to work together on more freight hauls in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY2wmi"&gt;While much of the public’s focus has been on Waymo’s autonomous minivans that operate in Arizona has part of a limited ride-hailing service, less attention has been paid to the company’s stated plans to eventually launch a commercial freight hauling business. Waymo has a small fleet of Peterbilt trucks that have been retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors and software, and it is currently is testing them in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078438/waymo-self-driving-minivans-trucks-texas-new-mexico"&gt;Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gIdMwz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;less attention has been paid to Waymo’s plans to launch a commercial freight hauling business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuiFLD"&gt;Ultimately, the goal is to deploy Level 4 trucks, a reference to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ (SAE) taxonomy for autonomous vehicles, commonly referred to as the SAE levels, which have become the global standard for defining self-driving. Level 4, or L4, vehicles can operate without a human driver behind the wheel but only within a specific geographic location, on a certain type of roadway, or under specific conditions, like good weather. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;Waymo has some Level 4 vehicles in operation outside of Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjk3NE"&gt;In addition to JB Hunt, Waymo is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt;working with Daimler&lt;/a&gt; on autonomous big rigs. The German automaker (and parent company of Mercedes-Benz) plans to integrate Waymo’s autonomous driving technology, widely considered to be among the best in the world, into its fleet of heavy-duty Freightliner Cascadia semi-trailer trucks.
