    <title>Faraday Future launches investigation into financial fraud allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4VORMBIdZ3fP-jLRFnclB6t3DA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146439/Home_charging_convert_default.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FmO7Kl"&gt;Faraday Future is launching an investigation into recent allegations of financial fraud at the startup, including claims from &lt;a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2021_10_07_ffie.pdf"&gt;a recent short-seller report&lt;/a&gt; by J Capital. The EV startup’s board of directors has formed a “special committee of independent directors,” which has hired a law firm to perform the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYuZOy"&gt;J Capital had accused Faraday Future of lying about the number of reservations it had collected for its ultra-expensive electric SUV, the FF91. It also accused Faraday Future’s founder Jia Yueting of unfairly benefitting from the startup’s recent public listing, which it accomplished after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587530/faraday-future-nasdaq-ffie-spac-ipo-investors-funding"&gt;merging with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9mGDA"&gt;“Faraday Future seeks to do business in the most ethical and transparent way,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021059453/ea150561ex99-1_faraday.htm"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “As a new public company, the Board, as part of its review, is seeking to ensure that the Company is adhering to the highest standards of conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmjRNv"&gt;The startup revealed the investigation Monday &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021059455/ea150623-nt10q_faradayfuture.htm"&gt;in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Faraday Future alerted the agency that it was not able to file its full financial results for the third quarter of 2021 on time due to the investigation. The startup did share that it lost $280 million in the third quarter, though, and reaffirmed its goal to deliver the first FF91s in July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2O0Lr"&gt;“The investigation is ongoing, and the Special Committee continues to work diligently with outside counsel and advisors to complete the investigation as soon as possible,” Faraday Future wrote in the filing. “The Company cannot predict the duration of the investigation, eventual scope, its outcome, or its impact on the Company’s financial results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRaulg"&gt;The startup did not name the independent directors on the committee, or the outside law firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kSNVW"&gt;Faraday Future is the latest EV startup to face allegations of financial fraud by a research firm with a short position — meaning the firm stands to make money if the startup’s stock price falls. Hindenburg Research released reports on Nikola and Lordstown Motors, and both of those startups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;wound up facing government investigations&lt;/a&gt;. (Nikola’s founder and former CEO was indicted.) EV startup Workhorse is also under investigation after a short-seller report was published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765287/doj-investigation-ev-workhorse-accounting-fraud-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;accusing it of fraud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gr0DJY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US finally adopts a national recycling strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-SOCIAL-POVERTY-ENVIRONMENT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dgtdhvie6-mg4puJ2py1afe8PSc=/6x0:5789x3855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146435/1236240047.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ekwMsH"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-bold-national-strategy-transform-recycling-america"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new national recycling strategy today, the agency’s first ever such commitment, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/11/15/epa-national-recycling-strategy-plastics/"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eLmnN"&gt;It’s a roadmap for the US to achieve a goal of recycling at least half of its municipal waste by the end of the decade. That’s a steep rise considering the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#NationalPicture"&gt;US’ recycling rate&lt;/a&gt; has actually declined since 2015, and was only at about 32 percent of all municipal waste in 2018 (the most recent year for which there’s EPA data). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRQZH6"&gt;The recycling &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/recyclingstrategy/strategies-building-circular-economy-all"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; the EPA announced today are just the first piece in “a series” of forthcoming documents the agency plans to release to work towards a “circular economy,” or an economy where resources are recovered and reused to make new products rather than allowed to wind up in landfills. It’s a sort of tacit acknowledgement that recycling alone doesn’t make a huge dent in the world’s trash problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wo4Ygf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Inadequacies with America’s recycling system were laid bare &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNTN3W"&gt;Inadequacies with America’s recycling system were laid bare after &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat0131"&gt;China stopped accepting&lt;/a&gt; much of our so-called recyclable garbage in 2018, including post-consumer plastic. Some municipal recycling programs were forced to close or cut back on their programs, which ultimately sent more stuff to landfills and incinerators. Programs that stuck around are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219042/online-shopping-ecommerce-packaging-cardboard-boxes-recycling"&gt;recovering from that global shock, on top of having to adapt to new consumer habits&lt;/a&gt; accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oG3sm"&gt;A dearth of federal recycling policy has, until now, hampered efforts to solve the problem. There are several key tactics the EPA plans to employ to meet its new recycling goal. For starters, the US will have to do a better job of collecting recyclable materials. The uptick in online shopping has changed where packaging waste winds up. There’s less cardboard for instance, coming from shopping malls and grocery stores because of the popularity of home deliveries. That has posed problems for recycling companies because cardboard coming from peoples’ homes tends to be dirtier than retailers’ trash, experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Often times, cardboard or plastic that’s too contaminated with food or other items can’t be recycled. So the EPA intends to do more public outreach and education to ensure more of the stuff people throw out actually gets recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyShVM"&gt;The EPA also wants to develop new markets for recycled materials so that it’s worth it for companies to recycle. That means there could be new policies or financial incentives on the way to boost demand for recycled materials. The strategy document mentions, for example, a “Demand Challenge partnership program” that would recognize companies for using more recycled materials in their products&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Notably, the EPA says it might finally “explore” ratification of the Basel Convention, a 1989 international treaty aimed at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20992240/e-waste-recycling-electronic-basel-convention-crime-total-reclaim-fraud"&gt;reducing the flow of e-waste&lt;/a&gt; and other hazardous trash from wealthy to lower income nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0b2vE5"&gt;The new strategy also marks the first time, the EPA says, that the agency’s recycling plans will connect the dots between waste, environmental injustice, and the climate crisis. The modern environmental justice movement, which fights to stop pollution from disproportionately burdening low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, has its &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/lm/services/environmental-justice/environmental-justice-history"&gt;roots in protests against a landfill&lt;/a&gt; built in a predominantly Black community in North Carolina in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQJKIS"&gt;Recently, plastic pollution has been in the limelight as a growing body of research finds plastics building up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226655/microplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-ocean"&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;sea life&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689941/babies-infants-poop-microplastics"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, too. Plastics are also tied to another environmental crisis: climate change. They’re &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=34&amp;amp;t=6"&gt;made from fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;, and oil and gas companies are looking to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21419505/oil-gas-price-plastics-peak-climate-change"&gt;lean more heavily into their plastics business&lt;/a&gt; as renewable energy eats into their profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uiku7G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stopping heaps of plastic and other garbage from piling up requires systemic changes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NdkNRk"&gt;The plastics industry has a &lt;a href="https://publicintegrity.org/environment/pollution/pushing-plastic/inside-the-long-war-to-protect-plastic/"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of promoting recycling as the solution for its waste problem. But in reality, only about &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782"&gt;nine percent&lt;/a&gt; of all plastic waste has ever been recycled. Some environmental &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712435/recycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution"&gt;experts and activists are also concerned that developing the market for recycled plastic might actually drive up demand for new plastics&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the quality of materials typically degrades each time they’re re-hashed, which is why products made with recycled plastic are often reinforced with new plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkb7NZ"&gt;Stopping heaps of plastic and other garbage from piling up requires systemic changes in how we use materials, not just how we handle them at the end of their life. That’s why the EPA says it’s working towards a circular economy, which addresses the entire lifecycle of a good that’s produced. Ultimately, achieving a circular economy will entail using fewer raw materials, designing products that last longer and use fewer resources, and having policies and infrastructure in place to efficiently collect items for reuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KefUgw"&gt;Basically, there needs to be a concerted effort to stop producing junk in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptFjNZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDTmSp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai’s restomod Grandeur is the perfect EV for a supervillain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bEReLMrzp1n-2scZ-zBOfg-3OoY=/1x0:1119x745/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146323/newsroom_211112_grandeur_1120x745.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q134Df"&gt;As someone who only dabbles in car culture, I usually find concepts to be more weird than enticing — but this is absolutely not the case for &lt;a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-motor-pays-tribute-to-original-grandeur-flagship-sedan-with-heritage-series-ev-resto-mod-0000016755?type=RES&amp;amp;category=News&amp;amp;listPageUrl=newsroom"&gt;Hyundai's Heritage Series Grandeur EV&lt;/a&gt;, which goes with an incredible retro aesthetic, rather than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054257/mercedes-benz-avatar-avtr-concept-ces-2020"&gt;an alien future one&lt;/a&gt;. While Hyundai says that the car is made to celebrate the anniversary of its flagship sedan launched in the mid-‘80s, there’s only one thing that springs to mind when looking at it: that it would be the perfect vehicle for a supervillain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys7D1Z"&gt;To be clear, I don’t mean a Marvel-style antagonist with supernatural powers. I mean a Gordan Gekko-esque SOB; someone rich enough to shape the future or bend the ear of bought-off politicians. The car’s blacked-out windows, solid hubcaps, and pixel-esque lights would look perfect in a Hollywood movie that warns audiences about the perils of greed, while simultaneously making its spoils look so damn enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fSMcfJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10867076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUaJwoagWpXBvL_He-xjX9hFSO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017009/Photo_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The infotainment system, which you could use to queue up your playlist that just loops The Weeknd’s “Heartless”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and “Faith&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0fndLE"&gt;(Side note: a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EXdhUqwD4QE?t=42"&gt;video of the car posted on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; shows that the head and taillight “pixels” can even animate, a la KITT from &lt;em&gt;Knight Rider&lt;/em&gt;. It’d be so distracting on the road but seems exactly like the type of thing you’d see in, say, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uOiPi"&gt;By the way, none of this is meant as an insult to the car or its designers. It looks, to be frank, &lt;em&gt;rad as hell&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s easy to imagine a friendlier version that looks more like the family sedans of the era. But this concept, with a velvet and leather interior, is sinister in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLWWMe"&gt;If Hyundai actually started producing its concepts, though, the Heritage Series Grandeur isn’t the one I’d actually want to buy. The Heritage Series Pony is more my speed: a small, three-door concept that, I kid you not, has a Nixie tube speedometer and horsepower meter. It’s like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858725/honda-e-price-launch-date-battery-range"&gt;the Honda e&lt;/a&gt; (which I would really love to be available in America, Honda!) saw the original &lt;em&gt;RoboCop&lt;/em&gt; and started going through a weird phase that actually kind of works for them? I certainly find it more interesting than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20828319/hyundai-45-electric-concept-car-design-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;Hyundai’s last Pony-inspired concept&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bkDKSU58HHOe324OVM-xVvHX7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016957/brand_pony_exterior_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pony is my dream car — an EV that speaks more to the New Coke-sipping intern than the quaalude-pounding CEO speeding past them in a Grandeur.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nNBQu58vk9G3yBmafcJDkMnwp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016951/brand_pony_nixie_tubes_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pony’s Nixie tube readout. Paging Steve Wozniak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hBLfhz"&gt;Unfortunately, it seems like both these cars are mostly just opportunities for Hyundai to show off both its creativity and its pixel-style lights that it promises will be a feature of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;an actual upcoming production EV&lt;/a&gt;. All I can do is hope that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/10/14215476/volkswagen-microbus-concept-id-buzz-emissions-scandal"&gt;like VW before it&lt;/a&gt;, Hyundai sees the stir its concepts caused and figures out some crash test-abiding way to release a real ‘80s revival car. It wouldn’t have to lovingly restore real cars from the era with a modern electric drivetrain (like it did with the Pony) to sell a car almost purely on nostalgia. It’s worked out pretty well for Ford with the Bronco, right?&lt;/p&gt;

In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser. \n\nNormally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request — or if you do, it may land you on a complicated-looking page headed “App &gt; Default apps.” Either way, here’s how to switch.",

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2rK6G7"&gt;If you’ve updated your PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may have noticed that when you click on a link for a website, a PDF document, or a variety of other file types, you will now be sent to Microsoft’s Edge browser. In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6FBt5H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8h8sJa"&gt;Normally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request — or if you do, it may land you on a complicated-looking page headed “App &amp;gt; Default apps.” Either way, here’s how to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IXoc02"&gt;Switch default browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPB00S"&gt;If you don’t want Edge to be your default browser, and your favorite browser isn’t offering to make the change for you — or if it did offer but instead sent you to the “Default apps” page — here’s how to switch the default. For this example, I’m using Google Chrome, but this should work with any browser that you have installed on your system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GQSVmd"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PKk51R"&gt;Under “Set defaults for applications,” either scroll down to where your preferred browser is listed or type the name in the “Search apps” field. Click on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDDskYt1jzHp3HLJw6aXzow1X2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908532/Screenshot__5_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BRZ48p"&gt;You’ll see a list of browser-related files, and under each file name, the app with which it is currently associated. In Windows 11, you can’t simply change your default browser with a single click — you have to change the assigned browser for every specific file type. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MCDLub"&gt;Look for the file types assigned to Edge, such as .HTM, .HTML, HTTP, HTTPS, and perhaps .PDF (unless you have a PDF reader you prefer). Click on the ones you want to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeVLc0rLMFwg4s4a8cFnjJJPU0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908534/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6e8TOE"&gt;You may get a “Before you switch” pop-up urging you to try Microsoft Edge — go ahead and click on “Switch anyway.” You’ll get a pop-up with a “Keep using this app” selection on top and your other installed browsers below. Go ahead and select the one you want to use. (Be aware that there may be some file types that won’t offer your browser as an alternative.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSqQpQeceV5bNmVJAzIzEy2Q6zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908535/Screenshot__8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10SILw"&gt;Note: by the time you read this, some browsers may have instituted a system for letting you more easily switch your default browser. For example, when this was written, the first time I opened Firefox, it asked if I wanted it to become the default. I let it go ahead, and when I went to the “Default apps” section of setup, I found that Firefox was now set as the default for .HTM, .HTML, .HTTP, and .HTTPS files. Edge was still listed for .PDF, .SHTML, .SVG, .XHT, and .XHTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOxLw8O3ehIDvA7Wfp9CIs56Yy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910128/Screenshot__92_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45S2Ao"&gt;One more thing: if you do open Edge for any reason, you will get the expected pop-up urging you to return to “recommended browser settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5F9mA7"&gt;That won’t solve everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QXShIl"&gt;But wait — there’s more. Even after you switch your browser default to something other than Edge, you’re still going to get Edge as the favored browser for a number of Windows apps. For example, bring up Windows 11’s new Widget pane (by clicking on the Widgets icon in your taskbar, the one that looks like a two-paned window), and click on one of the news items that appear there — and the link will open Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqLu97"&gt;If you find that irritating, there may be an app for that. In order to open Edge-specific links, you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eamg7s"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default Apps.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VY8eCQ"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom until you see “Choose defaults by link type.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ntL2zm"&gt;Click on that and then in the search box labeled “Set defaults for link types,” type “Edge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EqSQxy"&gt;Under the label “Microsoft-Edge, you’ll see “Microsoft Edge.” Click on that, and you’ll see any other browsers that you can use to open those specialized links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="F300zK"&gt;Interestingly, if you install Chrome or Firefox, you won’t see them as choices. But if you install the Brave browser, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; see it as an option — and if you select that, then whenever you click on a news link in the Widget pane, it will come up in Brave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set the Brave browser to open widget links." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HFKfj0oIvaoVtculNxl-nRcJ45g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22914500/Screenshot__10_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set the Brave browser to open widget links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YbkyaH"&gt;Another possibility is a tool called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector/releases__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xHc-FNSm%24"&gt;EdgeDeflector&lt;/a&gt; that was originally created to intercept any links in Windows 10 that were Edge-specific and rewrite them on the fly so that they can be opened by the default web browser. I did a little browsing and read that its latest version, v1.2.3.0, would work with Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42C5rv"&gt;I installed and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.daniel.priv.no/tools/edgedeflector/post-install.html__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xGOdR8WW%24"&gt;followed the directions for setup&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while that worked for most links, when I clicked on a link from the news sources in the Widgets pane, it didn’t quite work — the link opened in Chrome, but none of the graphics came through. I’d keep an eye on this app, though...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now Alexa can tell Netflix to just ‘play something’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4rTJ4urq5mw02FevZdNdgxU2_ec=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146189/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RsuzA8"&gt;Over the last couple of years, Netflix has refined a one-button solution that picks something for you based on your tastes and starts playing it right away. It first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374543/netflix-shuffle-play-test-random-tv-movies"&gt;called the feature names like Shuffle&lt;/a&gt; and eventually landed on Play Something. The button has top positioning in its TV and mobile apps, but now things are even easier to activate, as Netflix has &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/111997"&gt;linked its automatic selector to Amazon’s voice-controlled AI&lt;/a&gt; and streaming hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFmS2WBHT-gLV2QzmqQ9RePSMTE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017008/PlaySomething_Orange_1080x1080_S2KeyArt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wSjnIp"&gt;If you’re in the US or Canada, just say “Alexa, Play Something,” and if you have an Echo speaker or app listening in, plus a Fire TV device with Netflix activated, then that’s what will happen. In &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/alexa-play-something-on-netflix-e8d8f4fe5115"&gt;a post mentioning the feature&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix director of marketing partnerships Magno Herran says, “we are excited to partner with Fire TV to bring the Alexa voice technology to the Netflix Play Something feature. Now you can instantly discover a show or film we know you’ll love based on what you’ve watched before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJRCg6"&gt;Assuming you’ve already decided to live with a voice-controlled assistant, it could help you skip debating or scrolling through rows of titles at the start of each movie night. Even though many other devices and services include voice control, like Google Assistant, Roku, or Comcast, it appears that only Amazon has the Play Something command linked at the moment despite battling Netflix with its Prime Video product. The promotional materials mention it’s “available first on Fire TV,” so I’d expect to see it on other platforms eventually. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden signs $1 trillion infrastructure package into law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Participates In Tribal Nations Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0lc9WyBXWyoF0LuNVYqFoAwd10=/0x267:4000x2934/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146113/1236584326.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzFpPf"&gt;On Monday, President Biden signed a historic $1 trillion infrastructure bill aimed at repairing the nation’s roads and bridges along with investing billions into expanding access to broadband internet and bolstering the electrical grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBumOG"&gt;“For too long, we’ve talked about having the best economy in the world. We’ve talked about asserting American leadership in the world with the best and safest roads, railways, ports, and airports,” Biden said at Monday’s signing ceremony. “But today, we are finally getting it done. And my message to the American people is: America is moving again. And your life is going to change for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QKwGTa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“America is moving again”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw252J"&gt;The legislation is the largest federal investment in infrastructure in over a decade and the bill’s passage marks a significant and bipartisan win for the Biden administration’s domestic agenda. The package includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;$65 billion to improve broadband&lt;/a&gt; access with the goal of achieving universal connectivity by the end of the decade. Another $7.5 billion will go to building out a network of electric vehicle chargers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d75BxM"&gt;The infrastructure package also includes $50 billion to combat the effects of climate change and cyberattacks on national infrastructure and another $73 billion to improve the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MHbMe"&gt;At the beginning of this year, Biden intended to push through this infrastructure funding alongside an additional multi-trillion dollar investment in social programs and climate change. The infrastructure package that was signed into law Monday was sliced off of the broader social spending package and was approved by the Senate in August by a 69-30 vote. On November 5th, the House voted to approve the bill with 13 Republicans in support of the measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1OPcd"&gt;The second half of Biden’s domestic agenda — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751099/white-house-budget-climate-electric-vehicles-ev-tax-credit-deal-manchin-sinema"&gt;nearly $2 trillion&lt;/a&gt; — is still awaiting votes in the House and Senate. This additional spending measure includes $550 billion to combat climate change and $320 billion in expanded tax breaks over the next ten years to encourage electric vehicle and clean energy adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iu33SF"&gt;Outside of this bolstering of social services, the second package includes several benefits for consumers looking to purchase electric bicycles. If approved, the legislation would offer Americans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751273/ebike-tax-credit-build-back-better-biden"&gt;a refundable tax credit&lt;/a&gt; worth 30 percent of a new e-bike worth no more than $1,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fl2J7"&gt;The plan also creates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759759/build-back-better-biden-laptop-tablet-low-income-manchin-sinema-broadband"&gt;a new $475 million Commerce Department grant program&lt;/a&gt; to help low-income Americans acquire desktops, laptops, and tablets. Community groups will be able to apply for grants in order to provide free or discounted devices for poor and previously incarcerated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1NZtN"&gt;Congress returned to Washington Monday to continue deliberation on the broader social spending package and move on other critical issues, like avoiding a potential government shutdown before December 3rd. It’s unclear when Congress will vote on social spending bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t34T3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU70jf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Antitrust advocate Zephyr Teachout launches bid for New York attorney general</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Democratic Candidate For Governor Cynthia Nixon Endorses Zephyr Teachout For New York Attorney General" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dArkPAYcOsZwisqTCMBcvn8Hduw=/0x0:4696x3131/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146060/1013294870.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgAWK2"&gt;On Monday, progressive tech critic Zephyr Teachout announced that she will &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZephyrTeachout/status/1460277070966177806?s=20"&gt;run for New York attorney general&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. A law professor at Fordham University and a scholar on corruption and antitrust laws, Teachout could push for more strenuous penalties in several major tech antitrust cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaS6Rc"&gt;Teachout said earlier this year that she would run for attorney general if the incumbent, current attorney general Letitia James, decided to run for governor. In October, James announced that she would be &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-new-york-andrew-cuomo-kathy-hochul-15e1fc7cc5ef518503ca561d2fd8034f"&gt;running for the New York gubernatorial&lt;/a&gt; Democratic nomination, leaving the attorney general seat open next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CcPU6"&gt;At a press conference on Monday, Teachout said her priorities as attorney general would include fighting corruption and corporate abuse while defending civil rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoeHQa"&gt;“I have been fighting against corruption for my entire career, and I will go after politicians who lie and who think they are above the law,” Teachout said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMlKsm"&gt;While Teachout’s Monday announcement focused on political corruption, she has become a prominent proponent of using antitrust law to break up tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. In her 2020 book, Teachout discussed several ways in which state and federal governments could pursue breakups, like actions from the Federal Trade Commission and new laws from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4s70X0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The big tech companies dominate all aspects of choice”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y5fXWs"&gt;From her position at Fordham Law, she has also done significant research into the legal and political nuances of antitrust action. Last year, she published &lt;em&gt;Break ‘Em Up: Recovering Our Freedom from Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money&lt;/em&gt;, outlining the alleged ways in which powerful corporations like Facebook maintain their market power and stamp out competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Wocjv"&gt;“The big tech companies dominate all aspects of choice, controlling markets, picking winners and losers, listening in on our conversations, directing purchases,” Teachout wrote in her 2020 book. “They have gone beyond responding to consumer needs to dictating them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7V5Tpb"&gt;Under James, the New York attorney general’s office has helped lead several antitrust lawsuits against tech companies. Last December, James (along with 47 other attorneys general) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filed a lawsuit against Facebook&lt;/a&gt; alleging that the company maintains an illegal monopoly in the social media market. In July, James filed a second lawsuit against Google accusing the company of holding an illegal monopoly in the mobile app distribution and payment processing markets with its Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAWpwN"&gt;James’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;first antitrust lawsuit against Google&lt;/a&gt; was filed last December accusing the company of search result manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9pDCh"&gt;Teachout has voiced support for these kinds of antitrust actions in the past and called for additional remedies, like new antitrust laws, to combat Big Tech monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwZwYT"&gt;“Dismantling their power will be no small task,” Teachout wrote of tech giants in 2020. “We can break them up, and work toward banning their poisonous business model.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lak7f8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zpb8L2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney is giving its characters a license to brawl in this Apple-exclusive game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUD4t6pnre6XxT6gkRHEH4e0ihA=/97x0:1126x686/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146013/chrome_ghGnbrfT8M.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6DgKL5"&gt;If you’ve dreamt of the day Disney would wake up and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22736493/smash-bros-ultimate-disney-micky-mouse-sora-woody"&gt;see the huge potential&lt;/a&gt; in creating its own take on Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; fighting game... that day has not yet come. But Disney may have just taken a step toward that future with &lt;em&gt;Disney Melee Mania&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple Arcade exclusive coming this December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4yXOg"&gt;While we’ve only gotten the briefest glimpses from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playmeleemania/status/1460287296230813697"&gt;the game’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; (below) and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/disney-melee-mania-coming-this-december-exclusively-on-apple-arcade/"&gt;Apple’s press release&lt;/a&gt; today, it actually does feature Disney and Pixar characters like Elsa, Moana, and Buzz Lightyear smacking each other around with their powers, laser beams, and one mean oar in search of a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j0OrHA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Head in the game? Disney and Pixar's holo-arena awaits in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyMeleeMania?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyMeleeMania&lt;/a&gt; ⭐️Coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleArcade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppleArcade&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QF62cs1cRG"&gt;https://t.co/QF62cs1cRG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uwVMUCa7Vz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uwVMUCa7Vz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney Melee Mania (@playmeleemania) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playmeleemania/status/1460287296230813697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSY9cz"&gt;Here’s how Apple describes the 3v3 MOBA-esque game: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pelAJW"&gt;Each champion will appear in a distinct action-ready design equipped with their own set of iconic moves and unlockable cosmetics. Throughout five-minute matches bursting with battle arena action, players will need to score the most points possible — or defeat the opposing team as many times as they can — for a chance at victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jdMwtU"&gt;Apple’s promising 12 characters to start, and more to come, presumably all included in your Apple Arcade subscription fee — $5 a month with no ads and no in-app purchases &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164414/apple-arcade-family-kids-crossy-road-butter-royale-loud-house-netflix"&gt;is Apple Arcade’s whole deal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uUhzw"&gt;So far, we’ve seen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k4ybe6"&gt;Wreck It-Ralph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="466dUU"&gt;Moana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lHMTBj"&gt;Elsa (&lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NNn6Rt"&gt;Buzz Lightyear (&lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2k3o3e"&gt;Mickey Mouse (with his Sorcerer’s Apprentice costume)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Md5j8b"&gt;Frozone (&lt;em&gt;The Incredibles&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t3ryDD"&gt;Bing Bong (&lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gUASo"&gt;Jasmine (&lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LRIwlO"&gt;Timon (&lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xzxhsj"&gt;Maleficent (&lt;em&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4rrQqv"&gt;It’s from a studio called Mighty Bear Games, which brought &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/butter-royale/id1464623715"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butter Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Apple Arcade last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile hits its goal of 200 million covered by ‘ultra capacity’ 5G a few weeks early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4CjWuAi_BscdAQlGVVu0NurvA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145975/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtc5b9"&gt;T-Mobile has announced that its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobiles-game-changing-ultra-capacity-5g-now-reaches-200-million-people-nationwide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F15%2F22783712%2Ft-mobile-5g-ultra-capacity-mmwave-200-million-coverage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Ultra Capacity” 5G network&lt;/a&gt; now covers over 200 million people in the US, a goal the company had previously set to reach before the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ihkFg"&gt;T-Mobile uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675255/tmobile-5g-uc-icon-iphone"&gt;its “Ultra Capacity” 5G label&lt;/a&gt; for its mid-band and mmWave networks, both of which offer much faster speeds than its low-band “5G Extended Range” network. The low-band network — which is closer to 4G LTE in actual speed — has an even wider reach, with T-Mobile boasting that it “covers 308 million people across 1.7 million square miles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7bC9S5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MpcsZm"&gt;The rollout here is particularly notable given T-Mobile’s success with its mid-band network — &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; crowned the carrier&lt;/a&gt; as the fastest in 2021, largely due to the strength and coverage of its mid-band spectrum rollout. Meanwhile, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have seen their mid-spectrum efforts largely been put on pause: the two companies were planning on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;relying on C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; to shore up their mid-band coverage, but that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;rollout has been put on hold&lt;/a&gt; after FAA warnings that the networks could mess with radio-based safety systems on some planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCxgKC"&gt;Of course, there’s a big difference between “covering” that many people and actually having them use T-Mobile, and despite the celebrations here, T-Mobile only actually gives service to just a fraction of those customers. At the end of 2020, the &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Adds-5.5-Million-Postpaid-Customers-in-2020--the-Most-in-Company-History--and-Further-Expands-5G-Network-Leadership-by-Exceeding-Ambitious-2020-5G-Goals/default.aspx"&gt;company had just over 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, which is still a far cry from the 200 million people that can now theoretically access its faster 5G networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOmQmK"&gt;And just because T-Mobile’s 5G UC network has hit the milestone doesn’t mean that there’s still not a lot of work to do in building out its network further: thanks to concentrated population clusters in the US in major cities and dense urban areas, it’s comparatively easy to reach “big” coverage numbers. T-Mobile’s future rollout plans are expected to go much slower as a result, with the company hoping to reach 5G UC coverage for 300 million people over the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter Blue’s Nuzzel-like top articles summary has arrived for iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U47MV3jDHzxQ6koU6x0q6tUQkqc=/0x0:4320x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145890/3_Twitter_Blue_Blue_BG_Top_Articles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SVYlHC"&gt;Twitter’s Top Articles feature, which creates a report of articles popular in Blue subscribers’ networks, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1460291564895416322"&gt;now available on iOS&lt;/a&gt; after the company promised last week that it’d be coming “very soon.” It’s been available on Android and the web, but now everyone who subscribes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;Twitter’s paid service&lt;/a&gt; should be able to see a roundup of what people were reading and tweeting about over the past day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o2l0q"&gt;Top Articles is a sort of spiritual successor to a service called Nuzzel, which provided a similar roundup through email. Nuzzel was run by a company called Scroll, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;was shut down when Twitter acquired the company&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Twitter said at the time it planned to bring Nuzzel back, and now its most popular feature is available to anyone who is willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;pay the price for Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;. The premium service also gives users extra features like the ability to “undo” tweets or read ad-free articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2BJmp2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Available now on iOS — see what your network is sharing in the last 24 hours with Top Articles so you’ll always know what’s *really* going on. Check it out and add it to your Custom Navigation bar &lt;a href="https://t.co/NxLW8fTTPn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NxLW8fTTPn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1460291564895416322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pZIJYK"&gt;While Twitter Blue subscribers who miss Nuzzel will likely be excited that Top Articles is now available on all the major platforms, it does feel like there should be a lite-version for those who don’t want to directly pay for Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="De2bNi"&gt;While it makes sense that ad-free articles will incur a subscription cost, Twitter Blue as a whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"&gt;creates the impression that Twitter is paywalling basic features&lt;/a&gt; that should be available to everyone, regardless of which tier of Twitter they’re using. In that vein, Threader (an app that makes Twitter threads more readable by formatting them as articles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/threader/status/1460258719711694855?s=20"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it had been acquired by Twitter, and that it would be included in Twitter Blue. While this is likely good news for those with Blue, it being paywalled won’t help general Twitter users navigate threads any easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HNsPlf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter shouldn’t be hiding basic app improvements behind its Blue paywall  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
