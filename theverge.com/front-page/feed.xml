    <title>LG’s new batch of gaming monitors includes 4K / 144Hz panel with HDMI 2.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b5ekhTEYZFRXf6Bm1wB2xad2jtw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662113/New_LG_Ultra_Monitor_UltraGear__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nfYlR8"&gt;LG has unveiled &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/01/enhanced-and-upgraded-for-2021-lgs-newest-ultra-series-monitors-exceed-all-expectations/"&gt;three new gaming monitors&lt;/a&gt; as part of its CES 2021 announcements, following its introduction of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224922/lg-ultrafine-oled-pro-4k-monitor-ces-2021"&gt;new flagship entry in its UltraFine series&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. The new batch of displays includes a model refresh on LG’s 27GN950 gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1 support, a 32-inch 1440p display, and a 34-inch 1440p ultrawide monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkxFxS"&gt;The LG UltraGear 27GP950 is a 27-inch 4K gaming monitor, which uses a Nano IPS panel and supports a rapid refresh rate of 144Hz, though LG says it does offer 160Hz through overclocking. It also supports an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt; and variable refresh rate, allowing gamers to experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226726/asus-rog-swift-pg32uq-gaming-monitor-4k-144hz-ips-120fps-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-features"&gt;4K gaming on both PC and consoles&lt;/a&gt; at a 120Hz refresh rate, which could be appealing to new owners of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S / X who want to opt for a monitor over a TV for next-gen gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MNQRZB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG has yet to reveal a release date or pricing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B14UIk"&gt;A successor to LG’s 27GL850 monitor release last year, the UltraGear 32GP850 is a 31.5-inch monitor that features a 165Hz refresh rate (180Hz when overclocking) and delivers a 1440p resolution gaming experience. Lastly, the new LG UltraGear 34GP950G is a 34-inch ultrawide 1440p monitor with a 21:9 aspect ratio and features Nvidia’s G-Sync Ultimate certification, which LG says will allow the monitor to provide “the best picture quality with minimized visual stuttering and tearing.” (The other two in the batch are G-Sync compatible.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thM3RV"&gt;LG has yet to reveal a release date or pricing for the UltraGear 27GP950, 32GP850, or 34GP950G monitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s latest 4K laser projector supports AirPlay 2 for $2,999</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAa1i7a1_RcN7zPqbWwSokKMrVs=/143x0:1454x874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662042/pjt_hu810pw_2020_11_wireless_connection_d.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HU810P includes support for AirPlay 2 and other streaming standards.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Zd1Wb"&gt;LG’s HU810P is a new $2,999 4K laser projector which supports Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard and runs webOS 5.0. It’ll be available worldwide on January 18th. The projector was originally announced in August, &lt;a href="https://www.avsforum.com/threads/lg-cinebeam-hu810p-projector-with-dual-laser-2700-lumens-lens-shift-announced.3166777/page-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AVSForum&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLz5Vm"&gt;According to LG, the HU810P is able to generate a screen as big as 300 inches corner to corner, and it offers 2,700 ANSI lumens of brightness. It supports the HDR10 and HLG HDR standards, and it’s able to adjust its picture depending on the content you’re watching or the room in which you’re watching it. For example, it has Bright Room and Dark Room modes that can detect the amount of ambient light in a room and adjust its picture accordingly, and it’s also able to adjust its frame rate to 24Hz for films. Its laser light source is rated for 20,000 hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V26elvRW_D0G4NeLm01va_kZG-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232309/zoom_07.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The projector includes three HDMI ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utwt0E"&gt;WebOS 5.0 means the projector supports a number of streaming services natively, including Disney Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and Hulu, and there’s also Miracast support for streaming from compatible devices. Otherwise, there are three HDMI ports in total, of which one is HDMI 2.1, according to &lt;em&gt;AVSForum&lt;/em&gt;. The projector supports eARC for higher-quality audio, it can stream audio using Bluetooth, and it’s got Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMDqh0"&gt;LG released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/4/16851806/lg-hu80ka-4k-uhd-hdr-projector-announced-features"&gt;first 4K projector&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and it’s also released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/12/21/18151733/lg-4k-laser-projector-hu85l-ultra-short-throw-ces-2019"&gt;short throw model&lt;/a&gt; that works even if you place it just inches from a projection surface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bandsintown launches monthly subscription service, giving fans 25 exclusive concerts a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Visible Presents “Red Rocks Unpaused” 3-Day Music Festival at Red Rocks Amphitheatre - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfT8DGD2WZzWt4ijn5o_XOBtZuI=/45x0:3492x2298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662034/1270300100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rich Fury/Getty Images for Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SjFfKg"&gt;Attending an actual concert still isn’t a good idea in the United States, so Bandsintown is launching a monthly subscription service that will stream a number of exclusive shows directly into customers’ homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soa9uc"&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://www.bandsintown.com/plus/"&gt;Bandsintown Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the $10 monthly service pays for 25 shows a month, according to the company. Artists signed on to play shows include Phoebe Bridgers, Tycho, Flying Lotus, Soccer Mommy, Chromeo, and Little Dragon to name a few. Customers will also receive additional perks, including “intimate chats with artists” and access to performances on other platforms, according to the company. The first show kicks off this month, with artists scheduled through January and February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdWxsP"&gt;Musicians will receive a flat fee for each performance, Fabrice Sergent, managing partner of Bandsintown, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Some of the artists are provided with studio access in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville, and a select group of artists will be provided with a host for live Q&amp;amp;A sessions for fans to participate in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wksr1R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The reality is that we saw that fans were watching live streams from places that we had never seen people watching live music before”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GRASqJ"&gt;While the shows are exclusive to Bandsintown, artists aren’t. Sergent understands that while Bandsintown is experiencing a growth in users (before the pandemic, less than 30 percent of people watched live streams, but that number grew to just under 75 percent by October 2020), there are other platforms with much bigger audiences. He sees Bandsintown as complementary to other streams and to live performances once those return. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574128/bandcamp-live-stream-virtual-concert-tickets-merch-covid-19"&gt;pandemic helped prove&lt;/a&gt; there was a customer base willing to watch live music online, and that helped spur the monthly subscription offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXCs4E"&gt;“The reality is that we saw that fans were watching live streams from places that we had never seen people watching live music before,” Sergent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUdgRf"&gt;Currently, Bandsintown has 60 million registered users. Sergent declined to say how many people use the service monthly or how long they stay on the site. More information about those metrics will come at a later date, Sergent added. Right now, his focus is on building up the subscription service, which is exclusive to the US right now, but the company is hoping to expand it into international territories soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfikrr"&gt;Building up the subscription offering also includes finding incentives to get people to sign up, including figuring out better ways to sell exclusive artist merchandise. The goal is to have merchandise natively integrated into the service. Bandsintown’s teams want to find ways to support artists, Sergent said, but the company is also trying to jump on a booming trend and transform it into a revenue stream that exists long after the pandemic ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNqVMj"&gt;“We’re opening gates to something new that will stay beyond the pandemic, and will be complimentary to an in-person show.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today’s day ends in y, so it’s time for more Samsung Galaxy leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEfD5lZuHIVEFeNd8DCzsbhtF5M=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68662005/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1610374922_0_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked images show a case for the Galaxy S21 Ultra with space for its optional stylus.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7E9ca9"&gt;Samsung is announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;Galaxy S21 smartphones tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to dozens of leaks, most of the details are already public. Today saw yet more images of the upcoming handsets leak online, offering more details on their specs, key features, and accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wDd0I"&gt;First up is this &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120513.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It contains images of a case for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which includes space for its optional stylus. This case appears to differ from one shown in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212835/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-case-40-euros-accessory"&gt;previous leak&lt;/a&gt; that included a flip cover designed to protect the front of the phone. Cases like these are believed to be an important accessory for the new Galaxy device since it reportedly won’t include a built-in carrying slot for the optional stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAoH2i"&gt;Evan Blass has also shared a host of images of the unannounced phone. Images include one of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349037682555572226/photo/2"&gt;S21’s packaging&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be smaller in size and won’t contain a charging brick as standard, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120535.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Another image suggests Samsung is planning to offer wireless earbuds like the Galaxy Buds Live or Galaxy Pro, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;SmartTag Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt;, as preorder bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2jDiru"&gt;Blass has also shared a collection of screenshots that show how the specs of the three Galaxy S21 phones — the S21, S21 Ultra, S21 Plus — compare to one another. You can see the tweets below for the details.

    <title>Hogwarts Legacy is delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhIl06hCOSJy19bboSn0H6PkoYk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68661963/EnIVQHKUYAEGfed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pc8yyW"&gt;One of the year’s biggest games has been delayed. Today, Warner Bros. announced that &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt; — an open-world, action roleplaying game set in the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; universe — will be launching next year instead of in 2021. “We are giving the game the time it needs,” the developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1349400854000922627"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. No specific release date was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDUUHr"&gt;The game was first revealed last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440330/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-ps5-playstation-5-trailer-open-world-sony"&gt;during a PlayStation 5 event&lt;/a&gt;, and it takes place during the 1800s, well before the events of the films and novels. &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is being developed by Avalanche Software, the team behind &lt;em&gt;Disney Infinity&lt;/em&gt;, and overseen by Portkey Games, a new division created to oversee interactive &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfLEnz"&gt;It will be coming to a huge range of platforms when it does eventually launch. That includes PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Facebook Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth on evolving for a new medium&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Y1yo4l"&gt;In 17 years, Facebook has gone from a college social network to a potential gatekeeper for the world’s newest computing platforms: augmented and virtual reality. Its Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division sells the Portal videophone and Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, and it’s behind an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/facebook-smart-glasses-coming-sooner-than-later-without-ar"&gt;upcoming line of Ray-Ban smart glasses&lt;/a&gt;, with more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;advanced AR hardware&lt;/a&gt; in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHPO1O"&gt;Facebook is also building and funding VR software, sometimes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;competition with smaller developers&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, it launched its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405249/facebook-vr-space-horizon-access-public-beta"&gt;virtual social network called Horizon&lt;/a&gt; in beta. It’s also experimenting with &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/quest-2-infinite-office-announce/"&gt;a VR workspace system&lt;/a&gt; called “Infinite Office” that can blend the real and virtual world. Particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, these efforts could draw more people into working and socializing through VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUCSd5"&gt;At the same time, Facebook is navigating a privacy and moderation crisis. Its platform has been widely criticized for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499"&gt;bringing online extremists together&lt;/a&gt; and allowing &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-ads-can-still-discriminate-against-women-and-older-workers-despite-a-civil-rights-settlement"&gt;discriminatory targeted advertising&lt;/a&gt; or harmful misinformation. These problems will almost certainly follow the company into VR and AR, complicating already thorny questions about privacy and autonomy in these new spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scYUr2"&gt;Facebook Reality Labs head Andrew “Boz” Bosworth called 2020 a “tremendous” year for VR, and &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/no-looking-back/"&gt;in a blog post last week&lt;/a&gt;, he laid out plans to focus more on AR and Horizon in the coming year. I spoke to Bosworth over Zoom about how FRL will address present-day problems in futuristic tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krh7Dq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a pattern of social spaces launching for VR, then realizing there’s a really big audience outside headsets and launching on desktop or mobile. Do you see that path as viable for Horizon? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jm7BVS"&gt;Yes, it’s definitely a possibility that we’ve considered. If you want to build a social product, you want to reach people wherever they are, and requiring that they have a headset that’s not free, when they probably already have some other connected device, that just cuts some people off from having access to participate. And that doesn’t feel good to any of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Lbep1"&gt;We’re going to start in VR because if you don’t get that core mechanic right, then the rest of it kind of doesn’t matter. There’s already a lot of great software that solves the job of 2D-to-2D feeling together; we’re doing one of them right now. So we really wanted to have a strong foundation of VR. One of the things that we’ve always talked about is how to make this cross-platform, how to make this something that people can use and participate in at whatever level they’re able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ywFtE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook has talked about a system for letting people put apps on Oculus Quest that’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21299311/oculus-go-headset-discontinued-quest-alternative-app-channel-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;less exclusive than the Oculus Store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. What’s the status on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QoQwf"&gt;I’m very excited about that direction. And the status on that is it is coming much sooner than people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14jv64"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518194/oculus-quest-2-headset-facebook-account-suspension-problems"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pain points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for Oculus in the last year has been the switch to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;requiring Facebook accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to use the headsets. If VR becomes something that you’re using for work, it seems like a Facebook login isn’t necessarily the best way to access that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3iA0J"&gt;I think one thing that is a puzzle piece that you can put together with this is now, since we’ve talked about the Oculus and Facebook account linking, Facebook has talked more about account management overall. One of the areas of product focus for us is making it easier for people to manage all of their accounts. So Facebook Workplace accounts is a good example. It’s one of those pieces that I think when we look at Infinite Office, we’re targeting supporting that as one of the techniques that people can use to feel like, “Yeah, I can have my workplace Facebook account, and that’s what I’m going to use in certain contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="djvXqe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you want to be Batman in VR, you can definitely be Batman.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wtMcAq"&gt;And this is very consistent with how we want to approach this overall. We want people to have total control over their persona, right? If you want to be Batman in VR, you can definitely be Batman. We just want them to also be able to be Bruce Wayne if they should choose to. And so we’re trying to think of it that way — expanding the opportunity space from &lt;em&gt;“Yep, you’re Batman, but you can only be Batman”&lt;/em&gt; into having a lot more control over your persona, your connections, and how you show up. That is the work that we’re looking toward as Infinite Office continues to develop internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M20XVL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That seems like kind of a reversal of the way Facebook has talked about having a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2010/05/13/zuckerberg-privacy/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;single identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and a unified presence online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B42un9"&gt;I think the reality for us, especially in VR, is the ability to have a lot more control over your appearance — that’s not something that Facebook ever really dabbled with when you were dealing with just a profile. A lot of the problems at the time that Facebook was founded especially involved authenticity on the internet. You know, on the internet, no one knows that you’re a dog. Authenticity was a premium feature — that you really knew who this person was and could count on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOGgwO"&gt;Now we’ve actually gotten kind of full circle, where you can be embodied. Facebook never got to control how you showed up in a real interaction with somebody; that was never something that we got to control. Suddenly, you know, in VR, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a broker of that. So we need to provide you the full richness of self-expression that you would have access to — actually, a richer set of self-expression than you would have in the real world. So, yeah, new media demands new consideration. I don’t think it’s inconsistent. I think it’s just an acknowledgment of what this medium is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeIrEX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much is Facebook Reality Labs’ work limited by internet connectivity issues? Something like Horizon becomes a lot more difficult when people don’t have steady, fast internet access, and the pandemic has obviously thrown those gaps into relief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyXBgA"&gt;I believe there’s two parts to this. I’m always impressed with what we can do locally. I think no company has done more than Facebook in terms of shrinking artificial intelligences down and running them locally on device — for example, Portal, which does all its face detection and camera direction locally on device. And that is a huge opportunity that allows these devices to be useful even when they’re not connected in a lot of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HvjeG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Avatars require a lot less bits ... than [Zoom] does.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SuJubo"&gt;The second thing is certainly, you’re right. The really rich stuff that we’re imagining for Horizon might require robust internet connection. Obviously, I hope that not just private companies, but governments around the world realize how much internet connectivity and access to information is increasingly a human right that we need to support. But even if in the case where you have limited internet access, again, we’re seeing tremendous luck with artificial intelligences improving the experience people can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7jtot"&gt;Avatars require a lot less bits to express the richness of facial expression than [Zoom] does. Right? This is a very high-bandwidth connection. We can actually reduce that to a smaller number of pixels animating my face and send those. And you can still have, not a 100 percent accurate understanding of my expressions, but like a 95 percent accurate understanding and a dramatically lower bandwidth cost. So there are technologies here that actually stand to benefit. Moving toward avatars could actually help us connect even through limited or low-bandwidth connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eihdPG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve talked about how &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/facebook-reality-labs-principles-for-building-the-future/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;privacy and security concerns translate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to Facebook Reality Labs’ work. What are you specifically doing to make sure that a lot of the problems that have cropped up on Facebook in the last year involving moderation don’t happen in something like Horizon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMUIHA"&gt;I really want to separate out content moderation from privacy, because they’re very different issues. Content moderation is an issue that’s going to be with us forever. It’s been with us. It’s always been battles over who got to be editors and who got to be the censors. That’s a human issue that arose, you know, as soon as the printing press did. Arguably before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFAIpZ"&gt;On the privacy front, I feel lucky. I feel like we’re founding a new set of media at the current height of privacy debate, not just in this country, but in the world. We can have these conversations out in the open. We’re in a golden age for experts on privacy and the trade-offs around it, and we’re trying to take advantage of all that conversation that’s already happening, and put these use cases out into the world so people can debate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToYBvA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the business models after that? It seems like as long as Facebook Reality Labs AR and VR use the Facebook model of advertising, there are going to be privacy trade-offs at some point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoRSqx"&gt;You know, very much in a technology tradition, we’re not really focused on business model. You kind of assume that if you build a great and useful thing, that you’ll find a way to make money on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HGu5LK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not really focused on business model.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CQygW"&gt;I believe in [targeted] advertising. I think it makes the experience that people have in the world a lot better rather than un-targeted advertising. I think it’s hugely important for small businesses. I think it’s hugely important for maximizing the use of human capital. That’s a debate that is a distant debate for augmented reality and virtual reality. It’s not a near-term debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOf6V6"&gt;And so I have the great luxury of not worrying about it. I’ve got enough real problems right in front of it to go tackle before I worry about the business model. And so we’ve got to build it before I can think too much about that. And I’m confident if we do, there’ll be lots of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55nhFE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a more near-term problem, people have compared Horizon to Facebook Groups. What happens when a group like QAnon starts organizing on Horizon? How do you find them and decide what to do with them while threading the needle of not making it seem like you’re being creepy and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/facebook-horizon-privacy-monitoring-moderation/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;surveilling everyone all the time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ra0nwu"&gt;I don’t think there’s one answer to that, and there’s certainly not any answer that’s going to satisfy all parties. We know that from our experience on Facebook. And so I think on content moderation issues, you can expect us to really lean heavily on Facebook, which has done the lifting of talking to governments, talking to experts, and is constantly revising its policies as the facts on the ground change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1PHdZg"&gt;I don’t think you ever expect you’re going to have one stance, because as soon as you take a stance, bad actors are going to find little loopholes. It’s never going to end. There isn’t going to be one solution. So I think people should expect it to be like any digital space and, frankly, any physical space going back in history. You’ve got to continue to evolve what the regulations are as you observe behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 is nearly half off on PC</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="smbdPT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;released in early December 2020, and — controversy surrounding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;notoriously poor performance on consoles&lt;/a&gt; aside — it’s a fun, gorgeous game on PC, especially if you have Nvidia hardware that enables ray-traced graphics. If you’re still thinking about picking it up, you can snag the DRM-free version of the PC game that’s redeemable on &lt;a href="http://GOG.com"&gt;GOG.com&lt;/a&gt; from Eneba (a marketplace that sells codes — we’ve featured it several times for its excellent deals on PS Plus memberships). Normally a full $60, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fgog-cyberpunk-2077-gog-com-key%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it costs $35.18 at the time of publishing&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting that this key will work globally, according to Eneba, not just in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eX0VnU"&gt;The game might not be in the best state right now (though its many glitches do make for &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8RSuhJrSGZs?t=542"&gt;wonderful Highlight Reel content&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube), but developer CD Projekt Red has promised a few big updates coming in early 2021 that should address the most glaring issues that still linger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uBAGLb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Normally $350 outside of a deal (going as low as $278 for a new set), &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fitm%252FSony-WH-1000XM4-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Over-the-Ear-Headphones-Black%252F274493598619%2523viTabs_0%26campid%3D5338421468%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228682%2Fcyberpunk-2077-pc-sale-deal-gog-sony-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;these are just $210&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTvgWb"&gt;The seller, who has a 99 percent positive rating on eBay, says that these headphones are in like-new condition, and all original accessories are included. The seller provides free shipping and allows for a 30-day return window. If you live in the US, they’ll have a two-year warranty through Allstate. As someone who owns the WH-1000XM3, this deal has me tempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bUGUGo"&gt;There are more affordable USB-C hubs out there, but Dell’s puck-shaped model might be the one that suits you best.

It features an HDMI port and full-sized DisplayPort (with support for up to a 4K 60Hz monitor), a USB-C and USB Type-A port, Ethernet, and, last but not least, a VGA port. It does not support USB-C power passthrough to charge devices, though, so you’ll need to keep your laptop powered another way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon is celebrating its 25th anniversary with Katy Perry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2NBaukuhn3p6hSy_3FCnThT608=/77x0:947x580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68661441/ErniOBYXUAIXTey.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1bTzjo"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, and to mark the occasion, The Pokémon Company International is launching a series of musical events. Pop singer Katy Perry headlines P25, which will feature yet unnamed “rising artists to award-winning global superstars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7TcMn"&gt;Few other details have been shared about the program, aside from a brief teaser video. The company will also hold activations for the anime, games, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AeJ7Lx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_ZHajviuAY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LI8vmG"&gt;Perry’s had a brief, however unique presence in games before. In 2012, she recorded a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyW6AJ-yIk"&gt;garbled version&lt;/a&gt; of her hit “Last Friday Night” in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21126705/the-sims-simlish-language-history-20th-anniversary-game"&gt;Simlish&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Sims 3 &lt;/em&gt;and appears in-game with an expansion pack. It seems that she’ll at least be singing her own music for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI’s 2021 gaming laptops get Nvidia’s RTX 3000 series mobile graphics cards and Wi-Fi 6E support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A gamer, wearing headphones and an MSI-branded jacket and facing away from the camera, plays a game on the GP66 Leopard on their lap." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7k0B-U1-gCvLD7j385yKFu9j0s8=/0x0:9504x6336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68661370/GP66_GP76_scenario_photos__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The GP66 Leopard starts at $1,799. | MSI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2C7kzo"&gt;MSI has introduced its early 2021 lineup of portable gaming laptops during CES on Wednesday. The big news is that all the new releases have been outfitted with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;Nvidia’s brand-new GeForce RTX 3000&lt;/a&gt; series graphics cards. In addition to improved frame rates and ray tracing, these chips will deliver Nvidia’s latest features, including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226560/nvidia-resizable-bar-support-intel-amd-smart-access-memory-feature"&gt;resizable BAR technology&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also getting support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtHwDT"&gt;Headlining the thin-and-light lineup is the new GS66 Stealth. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;Last year’s GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, powered by Nvidia’s RTX 2000 graphics, was a capable 15.6-inch rig, but it couldn’t quite produce the frame rates to compete with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wm0jwE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MSI says you’ll be able to play games in 4K&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bzBQJ7"&gt;Presumably, MSI hopes to keep gaining on Razer with these new chip upgrades (especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;the Blade 15 Advanced is also getting the RTX 3000 series&lt;/a&gt;). The company claims the new GS66 will be able to run games at playable frame rates in 4K, which is unusual to see in a modern laptop. Models come with an RTX 3060 through an RTX 3080 Max-Q. You can pair those with a 10th Gen Intel Core i7, and a 15.6-inch FHD 240Hz or 300Hz FHD screen. You can &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6448270&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmsi-gs66-15-6-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-1tb-ssd-16gb-memory-black%2F6448270.p%3FskuId%3D6448270&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder the GS66 Stealth now&lt;/a&gt; to ship on February 2nd — models start at $1,799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFyOfn"&gt;MSI’s midrange GP Leopard line also has new inductees: the 15.6-inch GP66 and 17.3-inch GP76. These can both come with a GeForce RTX 3070; the GP66 has RTX 3080 configurations as well. In terms of processor, all models have a Core i7-10875H except the base GP66, which can come with a Core i7-10750H. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6Fugb"&gt;MSI has made the Leopards thinner (the GP66 is 0.92 inches thick, and the GP76 is 1.08 inches thick) and says they’re easy to open with one hand. Ports have also been rearranged: there are now some on the rear, as well as batches on the left and right side. You get seven in total, including an HDMI 2.0 and a USB-C with DP1.4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhAmNX"&gt;The GP Leopard is available to preorder now, with a release date of February 5th. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcore-black-msi-gp-series-gp66-leopard-10ug-268-gaming-entertainment%2Fp%2FN82E16834155714%3FItem%3DN82E16834155714&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228325%2Fmsi-gs66-stealth-gp66-leopard-laptops-gaming-price-release-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GP66&lt;/a&gt; starts at $1,799, and the GP76 starts at $2,299. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9uZ7iRyr-qQO-tshcN_J-GlW5Ns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232623/GP66_GP76_scenario_photos__9_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XdA1sd"&gt;If you’re looking for something even thinner, you may prefer the Stealth 15M, which MSI claims is the world’s thinnest 15-inch gaming laptop at 0.63 inches thick. That seems fair to me — I can’t think of a thinner 15-inch rig — but if you include multipurpose devices that can still run games like the &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/dell-xps-15-2-in-1"&gt;Dell XPS 15 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;, you get close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FE2rcR"&gt;Still, it’s a heck of a lot thinner than most 15-inch gaming laptops you’ll see, and at 3.75 pounds it’s on par with portable 14-inchers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; weight-wise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gn5URW"&gt;The big news with this is that the 15M will be one of the first gaming laptops powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen H-Series mobile processors&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that means you’ll have to wait a bit to receive one of these. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1597873-REG%2Fmsi_stealth_15m_a11sdk_063_stealth_15m_i7_1185g7_gtx1660ti.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228325%2Fmsi-gs66-stealth-gp66-leopard-laptops-gaming-price-release-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1597873-REG%2Fmsi_stealth_15m_a11sdk_063_stealth_15m_i7_1185g7_gtx1660ti.html&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eorder the Stealth 15M now&lt;/a&gt; starting at $1,399, but it’s not going to ship until &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16834155722%3FItem%3DN82E16834155722&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228325%2Fmsi-gs66-stealth-gp66-leopard-laptops-gaming-price-release-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 8th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="56Se2R"&gt;Finally, there are new GF75 and GF65 Thin models for gamers looking for more affordable devices. &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmsi-gf65-15-6-144hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i5-nvidia-geforce-rtx3060-512gb-ssd-8gb-memory-black%2F6448272.p%3FskuId%3D6448272&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GF65 models&lt;/a&gt; start at just $999 and&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcore-black-msi-gf-series-gf65-thin-10ue-071-gaming-entertainment%2Fp%2FN82E16834155716&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; GF75 model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcore-black-msi-gf-series-gf75-thin-10uek-048-gaming-entertainment%2Fp%2FN82E16834155715%3FItem%3DN82E16834155715&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228325%2Fmsi-gs66-stealth-gp66-leopard-laptops-gaming-price-release-date#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; start at $1,299 — they all come with an RTX 3060 or an RTX 3060 Max-Q as well as a 144Hz screen. Not bad for that price. You can preorder them now to ship on February 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring adds end-to-end encryption to protect your video streams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ring end-to-end encryption menu in app" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLslQfcff_8TDnlcn8l80gKX_aA=/0x0:2456x1637/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68661331/OTS_Press_Kit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rKnFDW"&gt;Ring is starting to add support for end-to-end encryption to its cameras. The feature will keep video streams encrypted from the camera all the way to the device it’s being streamed to, so it won’t be accessible to anyone in between. The feature, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453581/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-neighbors-app-amazon"&gt;first announced in September&lt;/a&gt;, will start rolling out today as a “technical preview” on eight Ring cameras, including doorbell, indoor, and outdoor models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctfMVc"&gt;“End-to-end encryption is really about user choice, to create that advanced layer of security,” Josh Roth, Ring’s chief technical officer, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Some people like a second or third deadbolt on their house.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rW1bEC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Some people like a second or third deadbolt on their house.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D3IsE4"&gt;Footage from Ring cameras is currently encrypted when it’s being transmitted to Ring’s servers and then again when it’s sitting around on Ring’s servers. But Ring still has to be able to access that footage in order to enable various features, like sharing videos through its website or streaming clips to any device you’re signed into. Ring says that it does not view customer videos without permission, but the company does have the technical capability to do so (and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177305/ring-employees-unencrypted-customer-video-amazon"&gt;been accused of doing so&lt;/a&gt; without permission in the past). If law enforcement received a search warrant for your footage, Ring would be able to hand it over, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mFET3"&gt;End-to-end encryption removes any visibility that Ring has into your footage, offering more protection for particularly privacy-conscious users. But the feature comes with some drawbacks that add hurdles and limitations to how the cameras can be used. Some devices, like the Echo Show, won’t be able to display Ring video feeds because they can’t (currently, at least) be set up to support the end-to-end encrypted streams. Other features, like sharing videos, become more complicated because you’ll have to download and manually re-upload videos, rather than just changing the sharing settings on Ring’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4GIvI"&gt;The feature also adds some friction to Ring’s Neighbors app, which allows Ring users to share video with people nearby and for local law enforcement to request access to footage. With end-to-end encryption enabled, camera owners can still share video to the Neighbors app — which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/7/18528014/fear-social-media-nextdoor-citizen-amazon-ring-neighbors"&gt;has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops"&gt;containing racist comments and reports&lt;/a&gt; — but they’ll have to manually download and upload the footage, adding some steps before they can post a recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GdfRy"&gt;At launch, end-to-end encryption will be available on Ring cameras that are plugged into power. Those cameras are able to process computer vision features, like person detection, locally on the device, whereas battery-powered Ring cameras offload those features to the cloud — something that can’t be done with end-to-end encryption turned on. No subscription is required in order to use it, but it’ll only be available in the US initially. End-to-end encrypted videos can be streamed to recent phones and tablets with the Ring app installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajdmfM"&gt;Over time, Ring plans to expand access to everyone and add in a few additional missing features, like snapshots. End-to-end encryption won’t be enabled by default, but Roth said Ring would notify customers when it becomes available. It can also be turned on and off on a camera-by-camera basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0G9B2"&gt;“End-to-end is one of those features some users are going to love,” Roth said, “and some will say they don’t need it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL1Qdp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 13th, 11:34AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The technical preview will be available on eight Ring cameras, not nine as Ring initially told us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
