    <title>HTC announces Vive Pro lip tracking module and new VR body trackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Facial Tracker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SVJfCUsOlSIsVfPpPT187vB4L4=/0x125:1920x1405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941990/HTC_VIVE_Facial_Tracker_attached_to_HTC_VIVE_Pro.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HTC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wDSEtM"&gt;HTC has announced a new set of trackers for its Vive virtual reality headsets, including one that captures facial expressions and mouth movements. The $129.99 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2Faccessory%2Ffacial-tracker%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323093%2Fhtc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vive Facial Tracker&lt;/a&gt; attaches to the Vive Pro headset. It uses two cameras and an infrared illuminator to record lip, cheek, and jaw movements and then translates that into virtual facial expressions. HTC says the product is “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKYqfb"&gt;HTC unveiled an experimental VR facial tracker in 2019, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321736/htc-vive-virtual-reality-social-face-lip-tracking"&gt;teased the product&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week on Twitter. A few developers, like the creators of social space Neos VR, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qZGoaNQD8"&gt;have worked with the tool&lt;/a&gt;. Until today, though, HTC hadn’t confirmed a wide commercial release. The Facial Tracker supports 38 distinct facial movements, and users can also pair it with the Vive Pro Eye, a Vive Pro variant with built-in eye tracking. That could effectively translate most of a user’s face onto an avatar or into a motion capture system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oeqiW3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_l4_aoiVAw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SXs4tU"&gt;There’s also a new, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2Faccessory%2Ftracker3%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323093%2Fhtc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-generation version&lt;/a&gt; of HTC’s general purpose VR tracker. The palm-sized tracking pucks are 33 percent smaller and 15 percent lighter than the last generation, and HTC promises a 75 percent increase in battery life. They will also be released “soon” for $129.99. Depending on the exact date, they could end up competing with the upcoming Tundra Tracker — a smaller, &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/tundra-tracker-kickstarter-delay/"&gt;SteamVR-based alternative&lt;/a&gt; that is expected to ship this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2s7qS"&gt;These HTC modules offer precise, accurate tracking for body parts that standard VR headset sensors don’t capture. Several VR social experiences, for instance, already estimate people’s lip motion based on the sound of their voice. But the new facial tracker can directly capture how their faces move, reflecting expressions like smiles and frowns. Similarly, the VR trackers can be fixed to custom controllers or attached with straps to people’s legs or feet — which are often given rudimentary animation or not displayed at all in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHdUCA"&gt;Unfortunately, the facial tracker apparently has limited compatibility. It’s listed as working with the professional-level Vive Pro line, but not the newer, consumer-focused Vive Cosmos. As VR developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OlivierJT_SU/status/1369660944679329795"&gt;Olivier JT notes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it also doesn’t appear to support Valve’s Index, a high-end headset whose hardware setup overlaps with the Vive Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1t7F0"&gt;Despite this, face tracking could become an increasingly important part of current-generation VR. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s VR division, Oculus, will prioritize capturing eye movement and facial expressions in future hardware as well as releasing more realistic virtual avatars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Text Adventures: how Twine remade gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhIbW2WgIta5mKUiZw7chgsrpj8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941964/VRG_ILLO_4425_Twine_Main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gAWj9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the video game&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, released in 2012, players wake up in a prison with few options: a shower, a nutrient dispenser, a garbage chute, and a recreation room with a virtual reality headset. For the first few clicks, all you can do is navigate the prison: getting your nutrient bar, cleaning up, examining a photograph by your bed. Then you put on the headset, and you’re thrown into a world of strange, vivid imagery. You live out a strange snapshot life before being thrown back to the same tiny room. You click through the same motions again and again, each time visiting a different world, as sparklingly strange as the prison is dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUk4HR"&gt;This was Porpentine Charity Heartscape’s &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;: a poem, a game, and many people’s first introduction to an idiosyncratic piece of free software called Twine. It was — and still is — one of the easiest ways to start making games. An open-source program that produces web-based interactive fiction, Twine can create branching stories simply by putting brackets around words. But the tool is also nearly as flexible as the web itself. Since its release in 2009, it’s helped create a new kind of interactive art — strange, small, lyrical, and often way outside the world of commercial gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loiVNE"&gt;Porpentine followed up with other surreal worlds — where raw intimacy and hints of nostalgia collided with violent, nightmarish cavalcades of trash and sex. &lt;em&gt;Cyberqueen&lt;/em&gt; spun out the messy psychosexual undertones of the ’90s &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; series, drowning a stock first-person shooter premise in slime and bodily fluids. &lt;em&gt;Cry$tal Warrior Ke$ha&lt;/em&gt; sparkled like a glitter-strewn Tumblr post and turned the “Tik Tok” singer into an otherworldly avenging feminine entity. &lt;em&gt;Ultra Business Tycoon III&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giantbomb.com%2Farticles%2Fporpentine-s-wonderful-world-of-slime%2F1100-4847%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22321816%2Ftwine-games-history-legacy-art" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;absurdist parody&lt;/a&gt; of a ’90s business simulation game, until its fourth wall cracks to reveal a melancholy parallel narrative. Her writing was simultaneously incredibly personal and transcendently detached from reality, and Twine shaped it into something that felt like a space to explore rather than words on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liufAh"&gt;In an industry obsessed with photorealistic graphics, focus-tested gameplay, and ever-evolving open worlds, Twine’s simplicity felt liberating. It imbued games with the DIY spirit of homemade zines, many of them weirder, sharper, and queerer than their mainstream counterparts. According to some of its biggest fans, Twine was nothing short of a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0A2IK"&gt;The reality was a lot more complicated and less utopian — but it would still help reinvent a medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hbNQdE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Mostly, video games are about men shooting men in the face”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="0ylzfl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Twine editor&lt;/strong&gt; looks like an architect’s drafting table crossed with a conspiracy chart. Users start by creating a “passage,” or a simple text field, that can be linked to new passages. When you’re done with the story, you “publish” it as a single web file, which you can load in any ordinary browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0xJsR"&gt;But Twine is much more than a branching choice simulator. It’s an open-ended system for making almost any kind of game with text, with a scripting language that lets authors determine how each word appears on a page. Twine encourages writing with a crude, hand-coded look, but a meticulous control of rhythm. Passages can make readers wait for agonizing seconds until a single word appears, or they can drop a wall of forking hyperlink paths in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pM6ay0"&gt;If it sounds like a blogging platform, that’s because it was — at least at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hSDig"&gt;In the late 2000s, Twine’s creator, Chris Klimas, was a full-time programmer and part-time student at the University of Baltimore, slowly eking out a graduate degree in interactive design. Klimas was inspired by old-school text games like &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;, but when he started building his own games, he was frustrated by their puzzle-heavy conventions. So he started looking for his own storytelling system and ended up building one on top of TiddlyWiki — a “non-linear blog analogue” designed by programmer Jeremy Ruston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MkrCab"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pxBFOz"&gt;Twine — and Twee, the language Klimas wrote to underpin it — wasn’t, fundamentally, a new idea. Authors in the 1990s had experimented with digital hypertext fiction, creating multi-threaded novels through websites or programs like Apple’s HyperCard. But at the time, Klimas wasn’t familiar with hypertext. His software also had two big advantages: it could be used with very little practice, and to play the resulting games, all you needed was a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZhMiy"&gt;Klimas started using Twine to write short fiction and personal essays. One of his first pieces was about experiencing syncope — a dreamlike, almost hallucinogenic fainting spell brought on by stress. The episode had sent him to the hospital, and he wanted to convey it in a way that readers could explore at their own pace. “That story was me trying to talk through what happened there and what that experience was like,” he says. “Just sort of saying, like — this is this experience that happened to me, and what happened afterwards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeMixz"&gt;Unfortunately, other writers weren’t nearly as compelled. “I was trying really hard at the time to get writers interested in it. I was like, ‘Hey, writers! You know, like, you like writing stories. Maybe you’d like making an &lt;em&gt;interactive&lt;/em&gt; story!’” he says. “There was sort of a small community. But for about a year, I think it didn’t really go anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yldBVm"&gt;After a couple of years, Klimas was nearly ready to write Twine off. It was tough to even gauge the program’s impact since it produced tiny files that people hosted on personal websites or even storage services like Dropbox. “I had kind of moved on,” he says. But slowly, he realized he was getting bug reports from people he’d never met — asking him to fix a tool he wasn’t sure anybody used. And he saw an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/apr/10/anna-anthropy-twine-revolution"&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a proclamation: the Twine revolution had arrived. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="uiF54J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Klimas had designed&lt;/strong&gt; Twine from within the small world of interactive fiction. His community revered classic text-based adventure games, and they often scorned newer and visually splashier successors. “It was like, text adventures are a cut above ‘video games.’ These are &lt;em&gt;serious things&lt;/em&gt;,” he describes it now. “We were a little bit self-serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npryhZ"&gt;What he’d discovered was weirder — and quite a bit lewder — than he’d expected. &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; had interviewed game developer Anna Anthropy, known for the BDSM-themed platformer &lt;em&gt;Mighty Jill Off,&lt;/em&gt; as well as the short and personal &lt;em&gt;Dys4ia&lt;/em&gt;, about her experience with gender dysphoria. Anthropy was also the author of a book called &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Videogame Zinesters&lt;/em&gt;, which urged people to express themselves with simple do-it-yourself games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEjkgV"&gt;Many now-legendary games were built by one or two core developers. And tools like HyperCard and Adobe Flash — as well as &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and other moddable games — turned millions of ordinary people into amateur game designers. But when &lt;em&gt;Zinesters&lt;/em&gt; was published in 2012, the term “video game” evoked glossy action franchises like &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt;. “Mostly, video games are about men shooting men in the face,” Anthropy wrote. “I have to strain to find any game that’s about a queer woman, to find any game that resembles my own experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kp5ktD"&gt;Like Klimas himself, Anthropy started using Twine as an alternative to complicated text adventure tools. “I was trying to find something I could use to make choice-based stories,” she recalls. “Twine was the least bad.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cEAUH"&gt;Her first story adapted a world from &lt;em&gt;ZZT&lt;/em&gt; — an &lt;a href="https://museumofzzt.com/article/445/town-of-zzt-map"&gt;iconic 1991 shareware game&lt;/a&gt; from Tim Sweeney, now the CEO of Epic Games, the studio behind &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Soon, she was giving Twine workshops and promoting it as one of the most affordable, approachable ways to make games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guZDIH"&gt;Mainstream gaming had become sclerotic and timid, Anthropy contended. Studios relied on hundred-person teams with multimillion-dollar budgets, reworking old ideas that they knew would sell. “Mainstream games are really depersonalized. They don’t really tell us a lot about the human condition,” Anthropy told &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; writer Cara Ellison. “What I want to see more of in games is the personal — games that speak to me as a human being, that are relatable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjowcw"&gt;Anthropy wasn’t the only person saying this. The year she published &lt;em&gt;Zinesters&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-gamer/308928/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; feted Jonathan Blow&lt;/a&gt; — developer of the hit indie game &lt;em&gt;Braid&lt;/em&gt; — as a disgruntled “maverick” who might finally “establish the video game as an art form.” But Blow was still a professional programmer who spent $200,000 painstakingly crafting &lt;em&gt;Braid&lt;/em&gt;. Anthropy was interested in people with far less money and little formal training, using off-the-shelf tools like GameMaker and Twine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mo0zzD"&gt;At first, Klimas didn’t know what to make of this new community. “I kind of came into it sideways,” he says. “It sort of percolated through to me — like, this is people really doing interesting things with Twine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIKuJB"&gt;In the years after Twine’s launch, it had expanded beyond those original TiddlyWiki snippets. Twine stories were ultimately web pages, and designers started adding images, sound, and JavaScript or CSS snippets that produced new special effects. Some shared their work online — like Leon Arnott, one of the key architects of Twine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlYm1V"&gt;Arnott’s code snippets played with how words appeared on a page. “Most of the features my code provided were to add dynamic changes to text within a single passage,” he says. A &lt;a href="https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/5020"&gt;cycling hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, would simply change from one word to another as you clicked it. A &lt;a href="https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/5029"&gt;timed remove&lt;/a&gt; could erase words if a player spent too long reading a passage. Some ideas were Arnott’s own invention, and some were features other writers had come up with but had struggled to create with Twine’s core feature set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQ8YCc"&gt;As Klimas kept building Twine’s open-source editor, he gave Arnott free rein of its default scripting language, Harlowe, cementing the idea that Twine was about playing with words and timing, not just choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8A81k"&gt;A Choose Your Own Adventure book might spell out readers’ options, but they can read the book at any pace in any order. Twine games — even ones mostly based around branching narratives — can compromise that sense of control. In Anthropy’s &lt;a href="https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Queers in Love at the End of the World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, your unnamed protagonist is facing the apocalypse. You pick an option for one last moment with your lover: kiss her, hold her, tell her you love her. How do you kiss her? Hungrily? Softly? Fiercely? What do you tell her afterwards? You keep clicking, scanning the text for more options. But at the end of a 10-second timer, each game ends with the same text: &lt;em&gt;Everything is wiped away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="COdJjA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It represented everything the stereotypical gamer despised&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="b4rOwj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Twine revolution” &lt;/strong&gt;wasn’t simply about non-programmers making games. Twine offered a home for people who felt alienated from the larger industry, particularly historically marginalized designers. “Twine is this amazing queer and woman-orientated game-making community that didn’t even exist a year ago,” Anthropy told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyDAR7"&gt;And if you found an intriguing Twine game, the tools for building your own were just a few clicks away. After interviewing Anthropy, Cara Ellison found herself thinking about the kind of design that Twine encouraged. “The more I thought about the rhythmic nature and the poetic nature of Twine — placing words on the page so that your eyes would fall to the right kind of part of the sentence at the time that you wanted — the more I thought, well, that’s quite sensual and a little bit sexual,” she says. So she began work on &lt;em&gt;Sacrilege&lt;/em&gt;, a melancholy story about romantic encounters at a nightclub. The short game struck such a chord that, when a bug cropped up years after its publication, a devoted fan discovered and repaired it. That fan has maintained the game ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deAW6x"&gt;Twine’s rise overlapped with a bigger shift toward games that told stories about real-world experiences or social marginalization. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/01/07/255247261/in-gaming-a-shift-from-enemies-to-emotions"&gt;An NPR article&lt;/a&gt; dubbed the genre “empathy games”: nonviolent, often mundane projects that tried to convey human struggles through rules and virtual spaces. Many of these projects were tiny, but some became breakout hits — like the exploration game &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;, which sold 50,000 copies in its first month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaDgXr"&gt;Some Twine projects earned praise from the broader industry. In 2013, &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt; made a surprise appearance at the Independent Games Festival, where grand prize winner Richard Hofmeier spraypainted its name over the booth for his own game &lt;em&gt;Cart Life&lt;/em&gt;, telling them to play &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs &lt;/em&gt;instead. Hofmeier described its effect as a kind of “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/magazine/twine-the-video-game-technology-for-all.html"&gt;holy dread&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8uUaqh"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YVKuek"&gt;But Twine writers were more likely to ridicule the gaming world’s excesses than seek its approval. Author Michael Lutz created a comically literal&lt;em&gt; Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; adaptation called &lt;em&gt;Tower of the Blood Lord&lt;/em&gt;, complete with a fake text-based online multiplayer and buttons for crouching and jumping. He said he’d only played 20 minutes of the real game, though — so the multiplayer mode is a food stand simulator, the “campaign” lets you swallow your commanding officer whole instead of selecting a weapon, and the story involves talking animals and questions about personal identity and the nature of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn0caP"&gt;Conversely, &lt;em&gt;The Writer Will Do Something&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/play-the-game-that-shows-how-hard-it-is-to-make-a-good-game/"&gt;an unsparingly unromantic farce&lt;/a&gt; about big-budget game-making. Players join the production team of troubled franchise &lt;em&gt;ShatterGate&lt;/em&gt;, where they navigate byzantine internal politics, impossible player expectations, and a dictionary’s worth of pretentious buzzwords. The game was created by Matthew S. Burns and Tom Bissell — who based it on real experience working on &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty, Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WcTe8"&gt;Even when they weren’t explicitly poking fun at traditional video games, Twine authors toyed with players’ mechanical expectations. Tom McHenry’s &lt;em&gt;Horse Master&lt;/em&gt; is nominally about buying, rearing, and training a horse for a competition. But your horse’s carefully managed stats — “uncanny,” “realness,” “pep,” and other strange descriptors — aren’t actually what’s being measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qtf2lC"&gt;For that matter, a “horse” probably isn’t what you think it is. Because Twine games also often exploit writing’s power to casually suggest unsettling mental images or intriguingly confusing commands — something that graphical video games simply can’t do. In another game, your central power is the option to “&lt;a href="https://debacle.us/ratchaos/"&gt;unleash rat chaos&lt;/a&gt;.” What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; rat chaos, exactly? Players can only guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iSCWkL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sublime fever&lt;/strong&gt; dream of &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt; helped put Twine on the games industry’s radar. But it attracted mainstream attention through a very different project called &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcF8Zl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt; is a deliberately unexciting “choose your own adventure” story. You’re a normal 20-something person trying to get by at work, get along with your girlfriend, and work on a passion project in your free time. Unfortunately, you’re also deeply depressed, so your brain won’t let you do this. Each day gives you a healthy path forward: order some food in the evening, go hang out with a friend, talk to people at a party. These options are crossed out, leaving behind choices like procrastination, long nights alone, and awkward silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPdm6Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt; — created by Zoe Quinn, Patrick Lindsey, and Isaac Schankler — earned positive mentions in &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mostly-indescribable-depression-quest"&gt;outlets like &lt;em&gt;Rock Paper Shotgun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an official exhibition slot at the Indiecade festival. Like a lot of so-called “empathy games,” it used rules to convey the feeling of being limited and powerless, rather than omnipotent and unstoppable. (Eventually, your life &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; take a turn for the better, but only with some concerted work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSxnG2"&gt;But in 2014, a year after &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest’s&lt;/em&gt; release, Quinn’s ex-partner published a rambling diatribe and urged a mob of internet trolls to harass them. The accusations included an unfounded claim that Quinn had an affair with a journalist to promote &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt;. And the movement — soon dubbed Gamergate — tarred Twine itself as the tool of an “anti-gamer” cabal. It represented everything the stereotypical gamer despised: terrible graphics, unapologetically rough edges, and experiences that poked fun at macho fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPJMk6"&gt;Klimas remembers being integrated into the edges of Gamergate’s sprawling conspiracy theory — which included many journalism outlets; the creators of nonviolent and LGBT-themed games like &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;; and somewhat paradoxically, the Pentagon’s experimental research wing DARPA. He wrote to friends in academia, warning them that Gamergaters had dug up their names as well. But mostly, he was bemused by people who complained that “any idiot” could make a Twine game. “I’m like, congratulations, you understand now!” he says. “Any idiot can pick up a pencil as well. The prejudice related to computational complexity — like if a tool is complicated to learn, it must be better — I completely disagree with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DggvS"&gt;As Klimas readily admits, his experience was very different from Gamergate’s primary targets. Quinn — as well as others like cultural critic Anita Sarkeesian and developer Brianna Wu — were accused of bizarre moral infractions and driven from their homes by threats. The movement painted critics of sexist or transphobic cliches as greedy criminal insurgents attacking defenseless big-budget studios, rather than tiny communities who put most of their work online for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaX3Up"&gt;Gamergate’s influence resonated across mainstream politics. The movement bolstered the careers of right-wing outrage merchants like Milo Yiannopoulos, who would later help promote the white nationalist “alt-right.” It fueled the growth of anonymous forum 8chan, which became a base of operations for the violent QAnon conspiracy movement. The controversy also forced companies and news outlets to reckon with much broader, older online harassment problems. Ultimately, many Gamergate supporters probably weren’t &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;passionate about niche game design software. But they saw ammunition for an endless, ever-evolving culture war — one that continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tsIghk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It manages to essentially teach you how to write well for video games”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="lZuVry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile,&lt;/strong&gt; the “Twine revolution” was more fragile than it looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua8mIf"&gt;Within a few years, the term “empathy game” &lt;a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2019/mar/27/empathy-is-not-enough-part-1/"&gt;turned from a straight-faced description&lt;/a&gt; to a wry, bitter joke. To critics, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2017/04/if-you-walk-in-someone-elses-shoes-then.html"&gt;the phrase implied&lt;/a&gt; queer or non-white game developers were attempting to explain themselves to outsiders, and that playing a 10-minute game was equivalent to living under oppression. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mgbwpv/empathy-games-dont-exist"&gt;Anthropy balked&lt;/a&gt; when people described &lt;em&gt;Dys4ia&lt;/em&gt; as a way to safely understand being a trans woman. In 2015, she produced an art installation called &lt;em&gt;Empathy Game&lt;/em&gt; that was simply a pair of her old shoes and a pedometer — making fun of the idea that players were literally “walking a mile in her shoes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAxcD3"&gt;A game could lay out someone’s personal experience, or it could help explain social systems that were often invisible. But simply &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; about that system wouldn’t necessarily spur people to change it. Awareness, it turned out, wasn’t a substitute for action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGrZ9U"&gt;Expressing vulnerability online felt increasingly fraught. Developer Merritt K, who had created games about BDSM and sex, took much of her old work offline after Gamergate. “A lot of it felt personal in a way that I was uncomfortable with,” she &lt;a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/merritt-k-on-changing-your-path/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Creative Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Not that those kinds of things didn’t happen before, but being personal online was a much more dangerous proposition after that for a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL3PUM"&gt;Twine itself wasn’t quite as simple and universal as mainstream coverage of it suggested. The tool’s interface and scripting languages were designed for writers who spoke English and understood the conventions of branching storytelling. Learning its more complex features requires sifting through a now-dormant Twine wiki, a still-active Twine “cookbook,” and myriad help threads across multiple forums. Publishing a story requires a basic understanding of web hosting or storefronts like Itch.io. It’s easier than many professional design tools but doesn’t have the radical simplicity of a stapled-together zine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SKNtO7"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hk2Znd"&gt;This tension had existed for years. Back in 2014, Dan Cox — who authored some of the most comprehensive Twine guides — &lt;a href="http://www.electrondance.com/faltering-faith-in-twines-teaching/"&gt;denounced what he dubbed&lt;/a&gt; the “lie” that Twine didn’t require programming. “Twine has never been free of code and never will be,” Cox wrote. Today, a wide array of Twine script re-creates or integrates other languages like JavaScript or CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCmrL5"&gt;Unfortunately, Twine &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t work well for big and highly complex projects. Passages start to freeze up if you type too much text in them, and if you’re developing a game with another person, it’s easy to accidentally overwrite their work. Klimas maintains the Twine editor alongside a full-time job, funded by a Patreon campaign that earns up to roughly $1,400 a month. It works remarkably well for such a small project, but it’s not as full-featured as commercial software or a massive open-source collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiCsHl"&gt;Some Twine supporters have drifted away from the medium. Porpentine had begun working outside Twine soon after &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, and in 2017, she distanced herself from other queer developers who had fostered Twine, &lt;a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/hot-allostatic-load/"&gt;publishing an essay&lt;/a&gt; that accused unnamed community members of abuse. When I contacted her, she described the essay as her farewell to any coherent Twine community. “Twine is pretty old now, and kind of died as a communal thing,” she wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR0TFz"&gt;Over time, the online landscape for Twine has changed. Many older games were posted on Philomela — a simple hosting platform created by programmer Colin Marc. “At that time, a lot of Twine games were hosted on Dropbox, which obviously sucked,” Marc says. “The site was a way for me to be involved and helpful.” (He also attributes it to a “pretty embarrassing desire to be friends with all the cool game dev people I followed on Twitter.”) But over the years, Marc drifted away from Twine, and the internet in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwJtbD"&gt;“My honest appraisal of Twine is that although it is really useful if you have no technical expertise, it is actually quite constricting,” he says now. “There have been really clever, interesting things done with Twine, but they were done by people working around the limitations of the tool.” Marc realized that Twine might never have a breakout moment, the way &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt; had sold mainstream audiences on exploration games. In 2019, he set off on a year-long travel expedition with limited internet service, and he decided to pull the plug on Philomela — moving its existing games to Google Cloud Storage and retiring one of Twine’s original hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="3h1o0t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than&lt;/strong&gt; a decade after its creation, Klimas’s work remains a significant force in gaming and interactive fiction. Browse &lt;a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-twine"&gt;the Twine tag&lt;/a&gt; on the Itch.io storefront, and you’ll find a steady stream of new titles — even if the “popular” tab includes a lot of games created years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAqMT2"&gt;Many designers use Twine or Twee to prototype branching narratives they’ll adapt for other platforms, including &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt; creator Charlie Brooker, who worked with Twine for the interactive special &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;. University instructors use Twine to help students learn game design basics before they start working with general-purpose tools. Even without a unified community, Twine still serves its original purpose: to give people an easy framework for imagining nonlinear stories, whatever form those stories ultimately take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0voPoL"&gt;Twine has helped inspire other software. The platform influenced Yarn Spinner, for instance — the branching dialogue tool used in award-winning indie adventure game &lt;em&gt;Night in the Woods. &lt;/em&gt;“Ironically, I think a lot of Twine’s influence since 2013 has been in the form of tools derived from it,” says Arnott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4K4KNn"&gt;It’s also still evolving. Klimas is currently developing a Harlowe alternative called Chapbook, and while Twine remains open-source, he helped design a proprietary tool for porting stories to iOS — and released his first game with it, &lt;em&gt;Night in the Unpleasant Hous‪e&lt;/em&gt;, last year. During the pandemic, Arnott decided to overhaul Harlowe with new features and fuller customization options, releasing what he calls the first “full” version of the tool in January. “I feel like Harlowe is currently in a state of stability it’s never had before — my long-standing desperation to improve it has abated,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDdiMk"&gt;While many people use Twine without any kind of support, there’s an active Twine community on Discord and Reddit. It offers help with design problems and organizes Twine-focused game jams, most recently a “Valentwines Day Poetry Jam” in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpZv92"&gt;Some Twine designers have made the leap to professional game development, fine art, or other fields. Porpentine has released numerous games alongside zines, short stories, and a Sundance Film Festival installation; in 2017, her games were exhibited at the Whitney Biennial. Ellison’s &lt;em&gt;Sacrilege&lt;/em&gt; led to work on the big-budget stealth game &lt;em&gt;Dishonored 2&lt;/em&gt;, as well as acclaimed lo-fi shooter &lt;em&gt;Void Bastards&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s a really good educational tool for figuring out whether you like working in games or not,” she says of Twine. “It manages to essentially teach you how to write well for video games, because it requires you to be concise and plan out how you’re going to make a conversation go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvQkfV"&gt;And the minimalist, white-on-black “Twine story” format instantly evokes text adventures and the early web. It’s easy to convey big, abstract concepts with a gloss of absurdity — like Kris Ligman’s &lt;em&gt;You Are Jeff Bezos&lt;/em&gt;, where your job is simply to spend &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9k77vd/you-are-jeff-bezos-twine-game"&gt;Jeff Bezos’s money better than he does&lt;/a&gt;. Like a pixelated &lt;em&gt;Mario Bros.-&lt;/em&gt;style platformer or the camera of a first-person shooter, it offers a recognizable template for translating almost any idea into a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cMacSl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If those services shut down, players’ work could be lost forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="hGr9qd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I put my first&lt;/strong&gt; Twine story online in 2018. I chose the platform because I had an idea for a silly pastiche of a first-person shooter series, I wanted to make it quickly, and I was an experienced writer but had no meaningful background in programming or art design. Then I got hooked on learning its scripting system and web design possibilities. A few months later, I convinced &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to publish &lt;a href="https://adirobertson.itch.io/wake-word"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wake Word&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a short game about a “helpful” AI-controlled apartment that keeps accidentally killing you. Its structure was shaped by the surreal, cyclical prison experience of &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BEI7H"&gt;I’ve released a handful of other short games since then, all of them built in Twine. And sometimes learning its scripts first instead of “real” coding feels like it was a mistake. I usually don’t make the branching narratives &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;experiential poetry Twine is best for, so I’ve spent a lot of time accidentally working against its constraints — like the time I wrote the start of a narrative game with a single fight scene, only to end up building a real-time word-themed combat system by forcing Twine to reload randomly selected links using dozens of overlapping timers. Still, coming incredibly late to the Twine party, I’ve benefited from years of forum members answering each other’s remarkably complex scripting questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpr7HB"&gt;As a woman who started writing about video games a decade ago, I’ve benefited in less tangible ways as well. Twine’s popularity helped raise the profile of several now well-known female gamemakers. There are still huge problems with misogyny in the medium, but in 2021, I feel a lot less pressure to represent &lt;em&gt;women in games&lt;/em&gt; — and more space to do what I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want, which is apparently making jokes about smart homes and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726477/cyberpunkland-dystopia-online-game"&gt;cyberpunk tropes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0kzzH"&gt;And sometimes Twine’s reputation as simply a beginner’s game-making system feels like a disservice. Because for all its limitations, Twine is one of the only tools custom-built for speaking the language of the web. The past several years have seen the rise of video games that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15027520/video-games-smartphone-mobile-text-messages"&gt;mimic digital spaces&lt;/a&gt;, like the instant-messaging simulation &lt;em&gt;Emily Is Away&lt;/em&gt; or the faux website &lt;a href="http://www.mackerelmediafish.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mackerelmedia Fish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At its heart, Twine is an easy way to write stories that take place in web browsers, and the more our lives play out online, the more powerful that can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pCE7A"&gt;One of the Twine jam organizers, who goes by Lee, says he grew up reading Choose Your Own Adventure books. But, “I got bored with the traditional [interactive fiction] format pretty quickly,” he says. He wanted to make something that didn’t feel like a branching novel, but also didn’t require extensive coding or art experience. So he began making horror games inspired by phone apps, websites, and creepypasta — the short, scary stories that circulate on internet message boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uEXO2Z"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36ztlO"&gt;Lee’s first published game, from 2019, is &lt;em&gt;Please Answer Carefully&lt;/em&gt;, which is supposedly a web survey about your screen time habits. After a few pages, though, the survey’s questions start getting strangely needy. Then, the possible answers start getting a lot more sinister. The experience is short and simple, without even the branches or multiple endings many people expect of interactive fiction. But it’s also very effective, slowly twisting what’s supposedly a blank mirror for the player’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5Cr8i"&gt;These kinds of pseudo-software games can comment directly on the larger conditions of the internet. Mark Sample’s &lt;em&gt;Content Moderator Sim&lt;/em&gt; gives you an 8-hour (actually, 5-minute) shift at “ViralTitans,” a fictitious content moderation contractor. Under a relentless timer and some passive-aggressive messages from a supervisor, it dryly describes social media posts that range from distasteful to terrifying, asking you to make a call on each one. It hints at the stress and frustration of being a moderator, but it’s not just a plea for empathy — it’s a test of which horrors &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; will personally let slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6lZpY"&gt;In 2021, Twine’s web-based design has proven surprisingly resilient. “I believe really strongly in the web,” says Klimas. “Things have been moving in the wrong direction for quite a while in terms of the web as a medium for consumption, not creation. But I think the battle isn’t completely over yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTvsgk"&gt;Twine is far from the only free and approachable game-making program, but its openness is still unusual. “There are more tools, but many of those tools are tightly gatekept by platform owners,” Anthropy notes. “Tools like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; make game-making way more achievable for non-professionals, but everything you create is owned by Nintendo or Sony.” If those services shut down, players’ work could be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyIauT"&gt;Many Twine stories &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; disappear at some point, lost to changing browser standards or lapsed web domains. But whether their work is ephemeral or stays online for decades, Twine lets people make art on their own terms — even if, eventually, everything is wiped away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="adobe signature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjbjjFADHTq31dc0jvrpDmyryDw=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941923/Adobe-Reader-EchoSign-iPad-Ink_Signature_Tool.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="biDYjK"&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic closed most offices, more and more official papers were being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) These days, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldxgQF"&gt;If you’re using a Mac, the process is refreshingly easy — just use the built-in Preview app to create and save your digital signature.  (If you’re using a Windows PC, unfortunately, it’s not quite as simple.) After that, when you open a PDF using Preview, it will be a simple matter of dropping the signature into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wuj5t1"&gt;To create your signature, you first have to have a PDF ready:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqdcaZ"&gt;Open a PDF document using your Mac’s built-in Preview app. (If you don’t have a PDF document handy, you can create one with your favorite word processor and save it as a PDF file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTP7Vf"&gt;Open the Markup tool, either by clicking on the “pen in a circle” symbol on the top right of the Preview window or by selecting View &amp;gt; Show Markup Toolbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9tESYh"&gt;Click on the Signature icon (it’s the one that looks like a signature on a line)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUzOkY0V_xOxGmA2jcph5CZPuPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357983/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_3.00.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOqMsK"&gt;Now, you can create your signature. As you can see from the three buttons on top of the window, you have a choice of three methods: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YZoTUM"&gt;Select Trackpad. Click on the “Click Here to Begin” button in the center of the screen, sign your name on the trackpad, hit any key, and then click on “Done.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tF4TPe"&gt;Write your name on a piece of white paper, select Camera, and hold the paper up to the camera (and on the line that appears across the screen) until you see the signature appear on the screen. (Two notes: first, the signature will appear reversed as you hold it up, but the digitized version will be correct. Also, if there are any other markings on the paper or if the paper doesn’t fill the screen, you are likely to get other markings recorded besides the signature, so you may need to try it a couple of times to get it right.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw8S_766-dKovKfLDHMnZFnJVsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357988/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.26.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DH8G9WgqNgZSplZCnVpDfYeaBYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357992/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.29.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HedzDU"&gt;Select iPhone. If you have an iPhone associated with the Mac, your phone will almost immediately pop up a field on which you can write your signature; your signature will be mirrored on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7c_r1m6Yo-O7GwkqYvJqIRUBFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358000/mysig.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This screenshot shows what the signature field looks like on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9X2ZS9zUPN0qTZ-lpYuolp4Kh0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358019/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.34.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AgSFFf"&gt;With any of these methods, if you need to try again, just hit the “Clear” button on the lower left of the window to get rid of the unwanted signature. Once you’re happy with it, click on “Done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWPnNK"&gt;Now, whenever you want to add your signature to a document in Preview, just click on the Signature icon and click on your signature. It will appear in a box on your document which you can then use to adjust the size and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1t60BhdsgBtpswS5moYEm85nzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358020/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.42.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMQ-3CcSxEIGPJYSAPS4PQPuK7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358021/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.46.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can move the signature to where you want it and make it larger or smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="53mHeR"&gt;And if you want a second signature, just create it in the same way. After that, when you click the Signature icon, you’ll see both signatures and can select the one you want to use. Don’t need one of the signatures anymore? Hover over the signature until you see a small “x” next to it, and click on that to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge looks to channel classic arcade Ninja Turtles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1FKRl73mf3XWgsWFDNukV8bEOE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941766/screenshot7.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xLofPm"&gt;Classic arcade-style Ninja Turtle action is making a return. Today, publisher Dotemu announced &lt;em&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge&lt;/em&gt;, which it says was “inspired by the classic &lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;/em&gt; brawlers we all kicked shell in as kids,” including the early ‘90s hit &lt;em&gt;Turtles in Time&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkYniW"&gt;For players, that means old-school pixel art based on the original 1987 character designs and co-op brawler action with up to four people. Also, for some reason, Mike Patton is here to sing the classic theme song in the debut trailer. Here’s the basic setup for the game, which looks to span a huge range of classic &lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;/em&gt; locales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2ei3Yt"&gt;With Bebop and Rocksteady assaulting Channel 6 and stealing super gnarly devices to support Krang and Shredder’s latest twisted plan, &lt;em&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge&lt;/em&gt; sees the Turtles battling across a righteous range of timeless &lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;/em&gt; locations. From Manhattan and Coney Island, to city rooftops and dank sewers, help the fearsome foursome trounce Foot Soldiers, Triceraton Warriors, and Rock Troops all the way to Dimension X!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="i57KIv"&gt;While it’s too early to tell how well the game channels those classics, the creative team does have a strong pedigree. The game is billed as a collaboration between Dotemu, which worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242538/streets-of-rage-4-review-ps4-xbox-steam-switch"&gt;the excellent throwback &lt;em&gt;Streets of Rage 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Tribute Games, which features some of the talent behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228652/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-review-switch-stadia-ps4-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the cult hit &lt;em&gt;TMNT &lt;/em&gt;game that launched on the Game Boy Advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbvTDd"&gt;There’s no word yet on when &lt;em&gt;Shredder’s Revenge&lt;/em&gt; will launch, but Dotemu says it will be coming to both PC and consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U953Fq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $21 on select Nintendo Switch games for Mario Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Mario Odyssey" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x50RGKR90fsJSF3z8stwJIAgJt4=/96x0:1161x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941706/mario.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XVmATT"&gt;Today is “MAR10 Day,” and although it is not Mario’s “birthday” (which is September 13th), this day usually has some of the best deals on games published by Nintendo. Nintendo rarely discounts its first-party games, so if you recently purchased a Switch and want to stock up on some games, today is a good day to expand your game library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPa1fQ"&gt;Several retailers — including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mario+bros+Switch+games&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734509568504630408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fcollection%2Fmario-bros" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fnintendo-switch-games%2F2636_4646529_4234943&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; — are slashing the prices of some Nintendo games, with up to $21 in savings available. Most of the games feature the mustachioed plumber, some of which are available for $39, such as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-Odyssey-Switch-Nintendo-Digital-Download%2F967828360&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03092021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fmario-tennis-aces%2F10157967.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis Aces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1005868/9383?subId1=VergeDeals031021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNew-Super-Mario-Bros-U-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592691%2F214311136&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Super Mario Bros.

Other deals include $40 for titles like &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496590475%2F55432571&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPaper-Mario-The-Origami-King-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596767%2F720441771&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario: The Origami King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592998%2F467273231&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.

&lt;div id="tUWACf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514828"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FCcO8q"&gt;The DualSense controller is a successor to the DualShock 4 and features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, and haptic feedback technologies that aim to deliver better in-game feedback. You get one when you buy a PS5 console, but if you want to grab another or if you want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591013/steam-input-api-ps5-dualsense-controller-support#:~:text=Valve%20has%20officially%20announced%20that,display%20the%20correct%20button%20prompts."&gt;use this controller on Steam&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab one &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $60 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;; that’s $10 off its usual price of $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7HELnA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JE13Qw"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are some of the best true wireless earbuds on the market right now. My colleague Chris Welch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;named the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners last year. You can grab &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new pair for $190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt; while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kN98th"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fva4HV"&gt;One of the most unconventional wireless earbuds available on the market right now is Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live. Despite the odd design, these bean-shaped earbuds produce a powerful sound and have lengthy battery life. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734506907090543434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic expands app store fight even further with new legal claim against Google in Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CY0LUPYlaP9hUS5UfO30ulT--Qo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941698/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fuk1zj"&gt;Epic Games on Wednesday expanded its worldwide legal fight against the dominant mobile app store operators with a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-legal-proceedings-against-google-in-australia"&gt;new legal claim against Google&lt;/a&gt; in Australia. The claim accuses Google of “anti-competitive conduct breaches the Australian Consumer Law” and also accuses the search giant of violating the country’s Competition and Consumer Act of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgiQZv"&gt;The legal claim follows a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/freefortnite-australia-press-release"&gt;similar action against Apple&lt;/a&gt; in Australia filed last November, and Epic’s legal fight against app stores now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286998/epic-games-apple-european-comission-antitrust-complaint-app-store-fortnite"&gt;spans the European Union, the UK, and the US&lt;/a&gt; in addition to Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUdSnb"&gt;The main thrust of the complaint is one we’ve heard before — that it’s due time Apple and Google allow app makers to bypass the 30 percent cut through either alternative app stores or alternative in-app payment systems — and it’s now a common rallying cry for the growing number of companies, app developers, and regulators taking on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HsQHaK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We believe consumers have the right to install apps from sources of their choosing.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="udzDRC"&gt;Epic says Google “abuses its control over the Android operating system, restricting competition in payment processing and app distribution on the Google Play Store. This harmful conduct stifles innovation, reduces consumer choice and inflates prices,” the press release states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kScDYF"&gt;“Google gives the illusion of being open by making arguments about the presence of alternative app stores on its platform or allowing direct downloading of apps from third party providers, but in reality these situations are so rare that they barely make a dent in the monopoly of the Android OS,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8XpB8"&gt;“The barriers Google places on Android OS are real,” Sweeney adds. He refers to actions Google takes, like warning users about downloading software outside the Play Store, as methods to scare users into only downloading approved software. “It’s actions like this that illustrate Google is more interested in feigning openness than delivering choice to consumers. We believe consumers have the right to install apps from sources of their choosing and developers have the right to compete in a fair marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzvWVL"&gt;This argument differs slightly from the one Epic has used against Apple in similar proceedings, as Google allows alternative app stores and side-loading of apps not approved by the Play Store. But “Google also makes it egregiously difficult to download apps directly onto Android devices, forcing the vast majority of users to obtain apps through the Google Play Store,” Epic argues. Epic says it’s also “participating in the Australian competition regulator’s review of mobile app marketplaces.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A former pro is helping figure skating look more authentic than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yK8hFgf_FGnlkl10bkvoV99o-So=/0x0:1209x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941396/jordan5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;On Ice Perspectives&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vW2DkD"&gt;On TV, ice skating often looks like a sport stuck in time. Cameras aren’t hanging from wires above the action or placed close to the ice for a dynamic look at skaters zipping by. Instead, a few stationary cameras planted around a rink flip from one view to the next when a better angle is available. It can be dull to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5uadz"&gt;But far more exciting and intimate ways to shoot ice skating have been emerging on social media, and one person in particular has made a name synonymous with turning the sport into something spectacular to watch: Jordan Cowan, under the name On Ice Perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fN0d7"&gt;Plenty of others try to make videos similar to those Cowan uploads to his channels. What gives his content the edge is that he was a professional skater who represented Team USA at international competitions, competing six times at the US Figure Skating Championships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jucdL1"&gt;Other professional skaters trust him on the ice because he’s one of them. Cowan’s ability to skate lets him stay in-step with skaters and keep them in his camera’s frame while speeding around a rink. Instead of following behind skaters, he’s usually along their path of flight, getting the best shot. In his videos, it’s easy to see a skater’s technique and exactly how they shift their weight with every move and transition. It’s pure fan service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="01iBuU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJBDmf8nnp6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:16px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJBDmf8nnp6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" background:#FFFFFF; line-height:0; padding:0 0; text-align:center; text-decoration:none; width:100%;" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;div style=" display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; &lt;div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="v4TuAc"&gt;Cowan visits rinks around the world to shoot with up-and-coming skaters, and present and former Olympic-level skaters alike. He’s uploaded more than 900 videos since the channel launched in 2018, and altogether, they’ve gathered over 25 million views across all platforms. Notably, former first lady &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleObama/status/1358863075663896582"&gt;Michelle Obama recently tweeted a video&lt;/a&gt; he made that shows Starr Andrews, a Team USA senior medalist, dancing to “Black Like Me” by Mickey Guyton. Recently, he’s been tapped to help shoot CBC’s &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Blades &lt;/em&gt;and ITV’s &lt;em&gt;Dancing on Ice&lt;/em&gt; programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NY3xSe"&gt;Cowan answered some questions over email to explain his technique, his tech, and his goals for On Ice Perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mr3qo9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCY8xx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you want to start On Ice Perspectives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCABeY"&gt;Looking at skating content on social media, I felt there was a gap between what I was seeing, and the truly inspiring content being captured in, say, the dance or gymnastics world. I wondered if someone with insider access, but also film and social media knowledge, could do for skating what several great dance videographers have done for the quality of dance content that we’re accustomed to seeing on TV and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="py9G5z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qqIH9ez7d9A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJyJps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What tech do you use and what’s your workflow like? Do you use any custom gear that you’ve constructed yourself? And what’s on the horizon in terms of what tech you could use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdeuYT"&gt;The camera I use for the majority of the work you see on On Ice Perspectives is the Sony mirrorless A7III, on a DJI Ronin SC gimbal, with a Rode shotgun mic for sound. For editing I use Final Cut Pro X on a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoeAyp"&gt;I am constantly tinkering with and improving the equipment that makes up my workflow. I like to think that I’m the only person using some of the configurations I have evolved, but realistically, everything I use is standard and accessible by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RU9meD"&gt;When I film for network shows, I generally use a rig made for cinema cameras with large cinema lenses. At this point I can’t own a rig of that caliber, and since it is my goal to bring a cinematic edge to the videos I share, it is my eventual goal to own my own rig that I can use to produce that level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5II7s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve shared the tech that does work well for your rig, but what hasn’t worked as well as you’ve hoped? I’m sure in your early days there was some trial and error.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rg2pO7"&gt;I think creativity is born out of necessity, and necessity comes from limitations. My first gimbals were very basic, so when skating around a curve, for example, the horizon would start to roll, and I had to monitor that and manually compensate as I was plotting my next move. My newer gimbals are more powerful and precise, but I’d be lying if I don’t miss that charm of a gimbal that’s constantly rolling into a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ofBDXc749wE?t=41"&gt;Dutch angle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCIm0r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the viewer’s perspective, it seems like you really can have a connection with the skaters that you record. The footage feels almost eerily in-sync with their movements at times. Can you explain how you do this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePAe6u"&gt;I am lucky that I was a Team USA ice dancer, and as such, I have the built-in sixth sense that all skaters develop when training daily on the ice with world and Olympic champions. I often can’t answer why I know, at the moment, where to go to get a good angle of a subject, but I know it’s thanks to my training, and I am grateful for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXKczR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think the camera work during televised ice skating competitions leaves a lot to be desired. It’s very flat, and it can feel tough to be connected with the skaters during their dances. Is this something you’re trying to change with your shooting style?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z9kkl"&gt;Absolutely. When you are on the ice with elite skaters, you can feel the speed they create. The shapes their bodies make only fully make sense when seen against the perspective of where on the ice they have traveled. It’s just not possible to portray this with the traditional filming from the boards audiences are used to seeing in the media. I hope to give viewers a window to the feeling that being on the ice or at a live show gives you, and that has entirely informed how I choose to shoot. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJNTbEX37RJ7zZg2jyD2votTyp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332028/jordan6.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iyWEgo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sorts of trends have emerged from your content? Are you seeing fans clinging to certain kinds of content more so than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Db9v2"&gt;It tends to be a routine made to music that breaks the traditional expectation of skating, like an ice dance team skating to Metallica or burlesque. It proved that skating as an art and dance form is linked to popular music, like most trends on the internet. The fact that it’s a sport as well makes it exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqzFbv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what point did you decide to build your channel into a business via Patreon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFENgK"&gt;I knew from the beginning that I didn’t want to charge skaters in order to be able to focus on building On Ice Perspectives. What I love about Patreon is that it gives viewers the chance to support not only the very significant costs associated with running the channel, but also to have a stake in the mission of creating unique skating content. Unlike a traditional sponsor, my patrons can donate just a few dollars and access the extra content shared there, all while making a very real impact on my ability to continue sharing skating content with the world. In a sense, Patreon allows patrons a greater connection to what I do with On Ice Perspectives, but also with the sport itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FYbEKg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fgegzg0x0-0?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=62&amp;amp;start=62" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XmfDz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your goals for On Ice Perspectives?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1OsbL"&gt;Honestly, I have so many. For the longest time I was focused on wanting to film the gala which follows the figure skating events at the Olympics, in a new and unique way. While I would still, of course, love to do this, my focus has shifted to wanting to produce livestreams and I hope, one day, a made-for-camera complete ice show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo is disclosing more autonomous vehicle data for research purposes</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VW2L1V1VakORybDQRVhCHbv-yrg=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941399/vpavic_4412_20210111_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3aZpp"&gt;Waymo is publicizing more data from its autonomous vehicles, which it says is for the benefit of the research community. Building on the trove of data it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20822755/waymo-self-driving-car-data-set-free-research"&gt;released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the Alphabet company is calling this latest batch “the largest interactive dataset yet released for research into behavior prediction and motion forecasting for autonomous driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHCpuD"&gt;This “motion dataset” includes over 100,000 segments, each around 20 seconds long, of objects like cars and people and their trajectories, as captured by Waymo’s sensor-laden vehicles. The company has included corresponding 3D maps and geographic details in each segment to provide researchers with context for their prediction modeling. In total, Waymo says it is releasing 570 hours of “unique data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7E0Hld"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A wide variety of road types in different urban environments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0rImvB"&gt;A wide variety of road types in different urban environments are featured, including San Francisco, Phoenix, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Seattle. Waymo says it included data mined specifically for its unique qualifications for research purposes, including “cyclists and vehicles sharing the roadway, cars quickly passing through a busy junction, or groups of pedestrians clustering on the sidewalk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKkg8w"&gt;Waymo also claims that its “perception boxes,” or the colored boxes used to distinguish different objects on the road, are “state of the art” and superior to other open-source datasets. “This is important because the better the perception system is at tracking the objects and agents in the motion data, the more accurate the resulting behavior prediction model will be at predicting what they are going to do,” writes Drago Anguelov, head of research at Waymo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjhoXy"&gt;To go along with the data dump, Waymo is also launching an open dataset challenge to encourage research teams in their work on behavior and prediction. There are four challenges: motion prediction, interaction prediction, real-time 3D detection, and real-time 2D detection. The winner of each challenge will receive $15,000, with second-place teams receiving $5,000 and third place $2,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7AjIA"&gt;Waymo isn’t the first company to release an open dataset. In March 2019, Aptiv &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2019/03/28/aptiv-releases-comprehensive-open-source-automated-vehicle-data-set/"&gt;became one of the first&lt;/a&gt; large AV operators to publicly release a set of its sensor data. Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, also released AV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18229397/uber-gm-cruise-av-visualization-open-source"&gt;visualization tools to the public&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Hasselblad’s 907X 50C is absolutely slow and absolutely stunning</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A digital medium format vacation, if you will&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="et8RTa"&gt;Hasselblad’s latest digital camera, the 907X 50C, is a 740-gram metal box that can serve as a standalone medium format digital camera or as a digital back for Hasselblad V System cameras made from 1957 onward. At $6,400, it is the smallest digital medium format body Hasselblad has ever made, and it is filled with premium Hasselblad touches. But its responsive touchscreen, all-metal body, and satisfying leaf shutter don’t make up for its slow auto-focus or lack of a viewfinder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kg8OdD"&gt;Using the 907X takes patience and practice, but if you are willing to put in the time, the 907X’s 50mp CMOS medium format sensor paired with Hasselblad’s gorgeous color science can create stunning results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SSSTRt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10383015"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4vfhdD"&gt;I have gotten so used to the DSLR and mirrorless camera layouts: using my right thumb for most controls and having a firm grip around the battery compartment. Using the 907X is done mostly with the pointer finger, and the lack of a battery grip makes holding the metal box feel awkward and foreign at first. There is a grip you can buy for an additional $729 that provides two additional dials and four buttons along with a small joystick, but I really challenged myself to use the camera without this expensive mod. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVR7CF"&gt;There is a battery compartment that houses dual SD card slots on the right side of the camera, a USB-C port with a small door on the left, and the shutter button is under the lens mount around front. On the back, below the 3.2-inch articulating touchscreen, are the flash, headphone, and mic ports, all cleverly hidden under a rubber door. Although all of the ports are covered, Hasselblad makes no claims about the camera being weather-sealed. If you plan on taking this out in any sort of precipitation, you do it at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d6SSvlAA7QSA6KGLLthgPPuDkw4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355639/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0009_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a rubber door that covers the flash, headphone, and mic ports on the base of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ia6pppqDgT64YO4dMRz-qKwF97k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355637/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0006_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are five rubber buttons under the 3.2-inch articulating touchscreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JyTv6R8qOjK6w-0thwOnJz91cqg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355638/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small door hides the USB-C port on the left side of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fVF89Q"&gt;Anyone who has spent time with Hasselblad’s traditional medium format film cameras will likely feel comfortable with the 907X’s layout. Otherwise, using this camera feels like stepping into a whole new world. To start, the lack of a handgrip leads me to support the weight of the camera on my right palm with my left hand gripping the lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb4VdH"&gt;Next, there is only one dial on the whole system. It runs around the shutter button, which is on the front of the camera. Spin this dial to adjust f-stop or hold down the small button on the right side of the camera while spinning the dial to adjust shutter speed. All other controls are on the touchscreen around the back, which is, fortunately, very responsive and smooth, quite a departure from the first touchscreen experience Hasselblad shipped on the X1D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlkqIT"&gt;Lastly, there is no viewfinder on the base model. As an ode to the waist-level cameras of medium format past, the 907X’s back screen can articulate 90 degrees up so that you are looking down and into the camera instead of through the camera at your subject. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euW-b2QFH8NYylIIlsF6IcporDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355634/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0002_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 90-degree articulating screen allows you to look down and into the camera at your subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pi4n5g"&gt;The 907X forces you to use it in a particular way. From the button placement to the lack of a handle to the articulating screen, there is very little about this camera that I was accustomed to. When attempting to take photos walking down the street, for example, I couldn’t just whip the camera up and nab a shot of a passing cyclist or the cool shoes of someone walking toward me. I would have to pull the screen out first, then dial in the ISO on a touchscreen, then adjust my hand to reach the shutter and f-stop dial on the front all before I could snap the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2Xu90"&gt;Another speed bump in using the 907X is the focus system. It’s contrast based, and it is slow. When pointing the camera at a subject, the pre-production Hasselblad XCD 80mm lens I was shooting with would hunt for at least a few seconds and often not be able to grab focus at all. If I had a limited window for capturing the scene I wanted, I simply wouldn’t even try because I knew I was likely to miss it. For me, missing the shot is more frustrating than just not trying in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZG9Zs"&gt;This was incredibly difficult to adapt to at first. I spent the first few days with the 907X constantly feeling like I missed the shot, that I wasn’t moving quick enough. And then I put the camera on a tripod, and I realized why it didn’t need a handle and why it isn’t in the hands of street photographers. This camera is not for the quick take; it’s for the thought-out, the particularly placed, the well-crafted shot. This camera does not chase the moment; it invites the moment to come to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2F2Ga"&gt;It is worth noting the 907X has one of the simplest menus, especially compared to the byzantine and terrible menu systems of Sony. There are five physical rubber buttons under the 3.2-inch touchscreen, but otherwise, navigating the camera’s menu system is done completely by touch. The main menu consists of 11 vectored icons that lead to deeper settings. It’s all very intuitive and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RyowpLz7Io6oyYotZFx-4kgWr-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355646/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hasselblad 907X has a 50-megapixel CMOS medium format sensor that can be used as a digital back on most Hasselblad V system cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1LOE0zR7GODivVEDcLsSo3rzblU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355643/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0014_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The all-metal body has a premium feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_0ZtLzLaDcXSuJ1Q95DBMY6D6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355641/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0012_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only dial on the 907X runs around the shutter button on the front of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIe4Y3"&gt;The magic of the 907X is in its 50-megapixel CMOS medium format sensor, which is capable of capturing 8272 x 6200 pixels. It’s larger than a full-frame camera’s sensor, but not quite as big as if you compared it to a medium format film camera. It’s also getting up there in age: it’s effectively the same image sensor Hasselblad has been using since at least 2018’s X1D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpFIqJ"&gt;The 907X with the 80mm f/1.9 lens produced the sharpest images at around f/5.6 to f/11, but the amount of depth you can isolate at f/1.9 is truly stunning. Although you can capture both Hasselblad 3FR RAW files and JPEGs, I like the colors from the JPEGs more than the flat profiles of the RAWs, even when I was editing them later on my computer. Hasselblad’s color science is truly remarkable. In particular, the red hues this camera captures are incredibly vibrant yet not over the top. I ended up seeking out red objects to take photos of, simply so that I could be amazed by how true to life the 907X could reproduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNz9p2"&gt;The 907X can shoot from ISO 100 to ISO 25,600. The image gets grainy once you cross ISO 6,400, but it’s a smooth grain that has a nice texture to it like film. I also took it out one night on a tripod and let that shutter sit open on still objects. The level of detail this sensor can capture never gets old, which led me to constantly zooming into the photos I had taken once I brought them over to my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MxUm9A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10382837"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3meRK"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unedited JPEGs from the Hasselblad 907X 50C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjzaVH"&gt;Video can only be captured in 2.7K, 29.97fps or Full HD, 29.97fps on the 907X. The camera also crops the image to 16:9. As a huge 4:3 ratio fan, this makes me very sad, especially considering how many pixels are not being used with the 16:9 crop. However, the video is crisp and holds on to that great color science. But for many reasons, this is not a video camera. It’s almost weird that Hasselblad even included the ability to shoot video at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK5JTk"&gt;First, there is absolutely no in-body stabilization, so when shooting handheld, you can see every shake, breath, and focus pull. Next, there is no continuous autofocus in video mode and certainly no face detection in either the photo or video modes. But more importantly, that lack of video frame rate and resolution options leads me to believe this camera’s video capabilities are for making GIFs or grabbing a quick video reference. Tune into our video review of the 907X for a sample video shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8Til8"&gt;I also don’t think the battery life could support consistent use of the 907X in video mode. While casually taking photos all day, I was only getting through about half a day of shooting before needing to swap in another battery. And while you can recharge the battery via the USB-C port on the camera, I can’t imagine owning this camera and not also owning at least two additional batteries, which cost $99 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LseadN9KFLA0ALH_xfpkmxYTyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355640/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0010_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A battery compartment houses the battery and two SD card slots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sixBjc"&gt;This premium sensor, sleek design, and brand name don’t come cheap: the Hasselblad 907X 50C starts at $6,400. For &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1436551-REG%2Ffujifilm_600020523_gfx_50r_medium_format.html&amp;amp;xcust=VergeHasselblad907X50CReview03092021"&gt;$3,000 less, the Fujifilm GFX 50R&lt;/a&gt; has effectively the same sensor in a more traditional-style mirrorless body. You really have to be in love with the Hasselblad brand or the desire to use this as a digital back for a Hasselblad V system camera in order to justify the 907X’s price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6SDsX"&gt;It’s that expensive price, the lack of any real handgrips, and the complete lack of weatherproofing that made me fear using this camera out in the world. I wholeheartedly believe it belongs in a studio that it will rarely leave, on product shoots where the goal is to make a viewer feel as though they can reach into the frame and grab an object, or in the hands of a much more cautious photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Hp43c7"&gt;The Hasselblad 907X 50C couldn’t be my daily driver, but it would be a sick camera to keep in the garage for those slower or gorgeous drives. &lt;/p&gt;
