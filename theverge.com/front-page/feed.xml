Importantly, the addition is cumulative for the most part, allowing the Ikea devices to function with the best features of Ikea Home Smart while layering on the best of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="IZMH4h"&gt;I’ve been testing both Ikea Home Smart devices for the past few days and while setup is predictably buggy, when they’re up and running it’s glorious, especially for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN3zbe"&gt;Motion sensors designed to work with HomeKit aren’t cheap. They range in price from $21 to $57 according to &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/best-homekit-motion-sensors"&gt;this roundup from &lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The popular Motion sensor from Philips Hue, for example, is more capable but costs $40, or almost three times as much as Ikea’s sensor, and both require hub devices to communicate with HomeKit. The Hue Bridge costs $59.99 while the Ikea Gateway costs $29.99, although these are often discounted in bundles with compatible lights and switches. An Apple home hub is also required, which can be a HomePod, Apple TV, or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce0z7b"&gt;There isn’t another product quite like Ikea’s Shortcut Buttons in the HomeKit world, so it’s hard to compare pricing. Some people will repurpose the four buttons on a $24.99 Hue dimmer switch to perform HomeKit automations, but it’s not really the same, and Aqara buttons are hard to find. Ikea designed its Shortcut Buttons to operate a single scene and that’s all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A8AAQT"&gt;Ikea Shortcut Button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="b8SOFL"&gt;The Ikea Shortcut Buttons are meant to be scattered around the home as dedicated controllers for individual or groups of devices. Place one next to the bed to shut off all the lights, for example, without having to yell at a smart assistant or launch an app. Place another in the kitchen to play your favorite Spotify playlist on the Sonos speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ckuHA"&gt;The magnetic buttons include a metal mounting bracket that can be screwed into a wall or attached with the double-sided tape found in the box for a less permanent option. They also ship with six stickers: three printed with icons representing nighttime, lights, and morning, and three blanks for you to illustrate yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea demonstrating a Shortcut Button starting a scene to The Verge in 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Huzdy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Operations can be assigned in both the Ikea and Apple apps with cumulative results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HbzcRn"&gt;The Shortcut Button can be assigned operations in both the Ikea Home Smart and Apple Home apps with cumulative results. It’s a bit confusing (and potentially conflicting), but combining the Ikea and Apple worlds makes the Shortcut Buttons much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUIbE4"&gt;I defined a “Good Night” Shortcut Button in the Apple Home app that I placed on a shelf above my bed. A regular press turns off seven smart lights (a mix of Ikea and Hue) and four Sonos speakers. A long press turns on a decorative filament night light in the bedroom at 10 percent brightness. To achieve these results, I had to assign a “scene” to the Shortcut Button in the Ikea Home Smart app and also assign “actions” in the Apple Home app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYYOfW"&gt;When using the Shortcut Buttons only with Ikea’s Home Smart app, you are limited to a single scene assigned to a single button press. But Ikea’s deeper Sonos integration exposes all of my Sonos speakers to the Shortcut Button, not just the newer AirPlay 2 speakers recognized by HomeKit. HomeKit improves upon Ikea Home Smart by detecting both a short press and a long press of the Shortcut Buttons. Apple also gives you the option of writing if / then / else shortcuts (confusing, I know) that can be assigned to the short and long presses instead, giving you four possible control options from a single Shortcut Button. (Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/luf1fv/use_a_toggle_shortcut_in_homekit_to_double_your/"&gt;useful thread explaining the steps started by u/armadawars&lt;/a&gt; on the HomeKit subreddit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sqSQQPqRTbXyATOLnr3u_Xaik-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342049/Good_night_ikea.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea Scene assignment for “Good Night” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SHVLTdPDQCdnFRhitMrXoavAvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342051/good_night_homekit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Action assignments for “Good Night” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mi7akv"&gt;So far, I’ve kept things simple. I have a scene called “Top music off” in the Home Smart app that I’ve assigned to the aforementioned “Good Night” Shortcut Button. This allows me to shut off any Sonos speakers that might be playing in, or around, my bedroom. In Apple’s Home app, I also assigned a mix of seven Philips Hue and Ikea lights to turn off with a single press of the “Good Night” Shortcut Button. I then assigned a long press to turn on the Ikea filament bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUFhEi"&gt;I have a second Shortcut Button in my living room currently set up to control my TV and mood lighting in the Apple Home app. A short press turns on my 2020 LG OLED TV and two lights to a predefined color and brightness. A long press turns everything back off. And just because I can, I also assigned a scene to the button in the Ikea Home Smart app that starts playing a Christmas playlist on the kitchen Sonos anytime it’s pressed. It’s dumb, and my family hates it, but it makes me so damn happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PNfZwf"&gt;Ikea Motion Sensor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mhCRnP"&gt;I would have driven myself mad setting up the Ikea Trådfri Motion Sensor in HomeKit had I not first read &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tradfri/comments/lqgf3a/using_tradfri_motion_sensors_with_homekit/"&gt;this tip on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umnuLU"&gt;Despite my Trådfri Gateway being upgraded to firmware 1.13.21 and seeing both of my existing motion sensors in the Apple Home app &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the sensors tripping Ikea lights when motion was detected, neither was detecting motion according to HomeKit. To solve that, first I had to remove the motion sensor from the Gateway (four clicks on the pairing button), delete the old rooms hosting the sensors from the Ikea Home Smart app, and then re-add the sensor (two clicks holding it next to the Gateway) where it was assigned a new default room. Only then did I see motion activity detected in Apple’s Home app, allowing me to control HomeKit devices with the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUltc3XgGcIj3Z6QznKNdla6ItE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342178/IMG_BDEF43E41AF5_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pantry sensor paired to Ikea lightbulb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7rXzu-z_VyCj7YCj7qpowcWBa2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342141/IMG_6300.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pantry light and sensor in Apple Home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6fNOB"&gt;As with the Shortcut Buttons, automations linked to the Ikea Motion Sensor in both the Ikea and Apple Home apps are cumulative. In my walk-in pantry, I paired an Ikea lightbulb directly to an Ikea Motion Sensor (press the link button on the Motion Sensor while holding it next to the Ikea bulb for about 10 seconds) and then set up an automation in the Apple Home app to turn on a strip of Hue lights above my kitchen cabinet, but only at night. The Ikea pantry light shuts off automatically after three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtmEfJij_sfBayfY7SeX6xn3Y54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342147/IMG_6299.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letting Ikea control the light, not HomeKit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g52PPACZ5t19AfmyZhsdTJDnXrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342135/IMG_6301.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pantry motion kicks off a secondary event in kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxP8uT"&gt;That three-minute reset built into the Ikea Motion sensor can cause conflicts with HomeKit automations. The Apple Home app lets you to assign automations to both motion and the lack of motion. It can also take a secondary action after a set period of time. For example, in the Apple Home app, I can tell the Ikea Motion Sensor to light a Hue bulb in the pantry instead, and then shut it off after one minute. However, it can’t be tripped again for another two minutes due to the three-minute sleep time, leaving me to rummage around the pantry in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PeTVT"&gt;Other motion sensors have much shorter reset periods, even as low as 20 seconds, which makes them much better suited for controlling lighting. Others also include temperature sensors, opening the door for even more creative automations. The Ikea Motion Sensor is basic by comparison with a price to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M2VAaV"&gt;Ikea’s Motion Sensors and Shortcut Buttons are so inexpensive and useful that they’re easy to recommend, especially for homes with a mix of Ikea and Apple products already. While the Motion Sensors are available just about everywhere, the new Shortcut Buttons have only started rolling out and still can’t be found in the US. Both HomeKit devices make the smart home accessible to everyone without apps or voice commands, limited only by the smart devices you own, your ability to write HomeKit shortcuts, and your patience with fiddly smart home tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s cashierless tech expands to London with first international store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b3GQOxvlsA2C_y5L7nctVfxV39A=/0x167:6648x4599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909461/Amazon_Fresh_JWO_Signage.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers scan the Amazon app at the store’s entrance.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3EPWk"&gt;Amazon has opened its first cashierless store outside of the US with a new Amazon Fresh location in London, UK. The store uses the company’s Just Walk Out technology, which allows customers to pick items off shelves and take them out of the store without having to stop and pay a cashier. Billing is handled automatically, but requires customers to scan their Amazon app to enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhbeaj"&gt;The launch marks a major expansion of Amazon’s cashierless stores initiative. The technology powering the stores, which uses cameras to track shoppers and their purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13842592/amazon-go-new-cashier-less-convenience-store"&gt;debuted with Amazon’s first Go store&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle in 2016. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=16008589011"&gt;over two dozen Amazon Go stores across the US&lt;/a&gt;. Last year the initiative expanded with a larger grocery store called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon Go Grocery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWjitsabZuiNC4YYwdj7wJiN8Ug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344614/Amazon_Fresh_Food_to_Go.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The store will sell hot and cold food, as well as other everyday essentials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PBQxia"&gt;Amazon says its London store, whose existence in Ealing was &lt;a href="https://london.eater.com/22309002/amazon-go-grocery-uk-store-opening-ealing-broadway-london"&gt;spotted earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, will stock a range of groceries, and fresh meals. There’ll also be hot food sold under the company’s own “by Amazon” label, which it says are prepared in store. The aim is to offer customers “everything they’d want from their local neighbourhood grocery store,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq5Cba"&gt;The store opened its doors at 7AM this morning, and will be open until 11PM, seven days a week. It covers 2,500 square feet making it a similar size to the company’s Amazon Go locations in the US, and a lot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less#ocRfvw:~:text=The%20location%2C%20at%20610%20E.%20Pike,450%20and%20the%20largest%20is%202%2C700."&gt;smaller than its first Amazon Go Grocery store&lt;/a&gt;. Additional stores are planned for the Greater London area, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azNlYh"&gt;In the UK, the company is using its Amazon Fresh branding for its cashierless store, rather than Amazon Go like it’s done stateside. Confusingly, Amazon does have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;Amazon Fresh-branded store in the US&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, but it doesn’t use the company’s cashierless technology, and relies instead on high-tech shopping carts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZTIZ3"&gt;Due to the pandemic, the company has a series of hygiene-focused measures in place at the store. Its maximum occupancy is limited to 20 to allow for social distancing, and there’s PPE and disposable gloves available at the store’s entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qiU7Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gT9Ej"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s desktop app now has video and voice calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwz2BWtWDqx9X3wMTtzDJI8t9FI=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909380/whatsapp.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ak1jtA"&gt;WhatsApp’s desktop app for Mac and PC is getting voice and video calling today, the company announced, offering end-to-end encrypted calls to other WhatsApp users on both computers and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U63rtc"&gt;Voice and video calling isn’t a new idea for WhatsApp: the mobile apps for Android and iOS already offer the feature, and WhatsApp started to roll out the desktop calling feature to a small group of users at the end of last year. But today’s launch means that the feature is now available to all WhatsApp users on desktop, making calling a more ubiquitous feature across all WhatsApp devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JLz4Zq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No, Facebook can’t eavesdrop on your calls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Okiirr"&gt;And like the existing video calling feature, the new desktop calling promises the same end-to-end encryption — meaning that WhatsApp and Facebook can’t see or hear your calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKGJ6V"&gt;The biggest missing feature is that, at least to start, the desktop app will only support one-to-one calling, not group calls. WhatsApp does promise that it’ll be expanding to include support for group voice and video calls down the line, although it hasn’t said when that will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzNVaB"&gt;To use the new video calling feature, you’ll have to set up the WhatsApp desktop app on either Mac or PC, which requires that you already be a WhatsApp user on mobile. Once you’ve installed the app on your computer, users will then scan a QR code &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/download-and-installation/how-to-log-in-or-out/"&gt;to log in on the desktop app&lt;/a&gt;, after which they’ll be able to use the desktop version of WhatsApp with their usual account. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi Mi 11 review: undercutting Samsung</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great deal if you can get it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xOHYgJ"&gt;Who is Samsung’s biggest mobile competitor? The first name that comes to mind is Apple, of course. But most people aren’t really in the habit of switching back and forth between iOS and Android with each phone purchase. So who is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rtoAT"&gt;Samsung is consistently ranked as the biggest phone maker in the world. Huawei is usually number two, largely because of its sales in China where Samsung is a nonentity. And number three right now is Xiaomi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RmTVP"&gt;The reason I bring this up is because Xiaomi’s latest flagship phone, the Mi 11, is not only extremely good in its own right but a phone that arguably outflanks Samsung’s latest lineup. It costs less than the $799 Galaxy S21 in markets where it’s sold, but in many ways, it has more in common with the $1,199 S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtftQU"&gt;The Mi 11 would be a strong competitor to any S21 phone if you saw the two next to each other in a US carrier store. The only problem is you won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zA1dnA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10371499"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UB9Pg7"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t particularly exciting to look at, but it’s well-built and solidly designed. It follows Xiaomi’s usual glass sandwich blueprint, with a frosted glass back panel and an iridescent but fairly understated gradient finish. The biggest visual flourish is the squircle-shaped camera bump, which features three distinct layers stepping up to the large primary lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWCLX6"&gt;With a 6.8-inch screen, this is not going to be a phone for people who prefer smaller devices, but it manages to feel relatively svelte all the same. The slight chin below the display is very thin, and the screen curves gently on the sides. At 8.1mm thick and weighing 196 grams, it’s noticeably thinner and a little lighter than last year’s Mi 10, with a slightly smaller (but still big) 4,600mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zSAt51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klqqBv"&gt;That may well have something to do with its Snapdragon 888 processor, which is Qualcomm’s high-end chip for 2021; unlike last year’s 865, the 5G modem is integrated directly into the SoC, saving space and power. My Mi 11 review unit pairs the 888 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, though more expensive models have options for 12GB and 256GB, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dB5wnF"&gt;In use, the Mi 11 more than passes the “feels like a flagship” test. As expected based on the spec sheet, it’s as fast and responsive as any Android phone on the market. There’s a strong haptics system, and the Harman Kardon-branded stereo speakers sound good, though I’m not sure they have anything in common with my long-serving &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harmankardon.com%2Fcomputer-speakers%2FSOUNDSTICKS%2BIII.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310843%2Fxiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundSticks&lt;/a&gt;. Xiaomi’s MIUI 12 software is based on Android 11, and it’s far more streamlined than earlier iterations; Xiaomi has come a long way with its software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUBxP9"&gt;Battery life is strong: I got almost exactly five hours of screen time on one recent day of testing, and more than three of those hours involved using the phone to take photos and videos in bright, direct sunlight, all with the screen at its maximum 120Hz and 1440p settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeWrvI4ucX_V5eUV_uZc2ZKJynk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341980/DSCF7528.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11 has a nearly identical screen to the Samsung S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LqkdLs"&gt;That brings me to the display. If the Mi 11’s screen isn’t identical to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;much-vaunted OLED panel found in Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, it’s extremely similar. Both are 6.8-inch curved LTPO OLED panels with a 120Hz refresh rate, a 3200 x 1440 resolution, and a maximum brightness of 1,500 nits. What matters is that the Mi 11’s display is extremely good, which it is. It’s sharp and smooth, with excellent contrast and color reproduction, and the extra brightness is noticeable on sunny days. I know not everyone is a fan of curved screen edges, but these are about as subtle as it gets, and I didn’t have any issues with visual distortion or accidental touch input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzYiIO"&gt;My only complaint about the screen is a weird one: the corners are cut at a more dramatic angle than the edges of the phone itself, resulting in a bezel that intrudes more than it probably should. I’m not sure why Xiaomi designed the phone this way — the otherwise similar Mi 10 didn’t do this — but the effect is quite odd. Still, it’s not something I’ve really noticed since I first started using the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzcVNm"&gt;I’ll also add that the optical in-display fingerprint sensor in the Mi 11 is sometimes noticeably slower than what I tend to see in phones from competitors like Vivo and Oppo. It’s rarely inaccurate, but the half-second it normally takes to recognize my fingerprint can sometimes feel closer to a second, and those split-second delays do add up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nWq4WFe31gkIXYDVt8ncUjLqy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341984/DSCF7532.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mi 11’s main camera uses the same sensor as last year’s Mi 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tc8QRC"&gt;One area Xiaomi where seems to have saved money on the Mi 11 is its camera system. The primary sensor is the same 108-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX from the Mi 10, which Xiaomi says it co-developed with Samsung’s component division. It’s backed up by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 5-megapixel “telemacro,” meaning there’s no real telephoto capability unless you want to get really close to your subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNI7Ku"&gt;Despite the pedestrian hardware, I’m generally happy with how the Mi 11 cameras perform, particularly considering its price. Detail and dynamic range are strong in good light, with fairly neutral color rendition, and low-light performance also holds up well. The biggest weakness is dim lighting situations that fall between those two extremes, which can get noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ficAVj"&gt;The large, high-resolution sensor has its benefits, but there are clear drawbacks. You might value the fact that it offers shallower depth of field (without a portrait mode) than most other phones, for example, but you’ll also have to deal with occasionally busy bokeh or areas of the scene that appear unexpectedly out of focus. And while the 108-megapixel sensor can render a lot of detail, it’s absolutely not a substitute for a telephoto lens; pictures taken at even 2x digital zoom exhibit a lot of artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_L4ar3mORQuysQYWY4S8GG1vRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344505/IMG_20210211_175537.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBdMuwrBwGQUfQVI7ynl3GArIjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344506/IMG_20210211_143734.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20NxvunWA-68-_5gwgrJ2Ueekrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344507/IMG_20210221_124336_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TfqCDHzhc5TUD_9rf68OAX8TsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344508/IMG_20210206_173725.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RDkFET"&gt;I wouldn’t normally even mention the macro lens, which is often a useless 2-megapixel sensor thrown at a phone just so the maker can claim a triple- or quad-camera system, but the Mi 11’s 5-megapixel 50mm-equivalent unit is a little better than most. It actually autofocuses, for one thing, which makes it much easier to capture what you’re trying to see close up. I still don’t feel the need for an extreme macro lens on my phone, but I was at least able to use it to check out the tiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icons texture on my PS5 controller&lt;/a&gt;. So there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0ZLtc"&gt;Overall, the Mi 11 camera system is more than fit for purpose, but it’s also perhaps the only thing about this phone that doesn’t go toe-to-toe with more expensive flagships. The lack of a telephoto lens hurts it, and the last-gen image sensor has its quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jAC2nqt2b4m5gwbic4vBnEiUlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341985/DSCF7534.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fit and finish of the Mi 11 are comparable to any premium phone you might find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lB1wvq"&gt;My biggest takeaway from the Mi 11 is that Samsung is lucky Xiaomi doesn’t sell phones in the US. The Galaxy S21 starts at a full 100 euros more than the €749 Mi 11, despite having a smaller, lower-resolution screen and a plastic back. The same goes for the S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYqkqI"&gt;The €1,249 S21 Ultra is where the comparison gets interesting. Samsung’s highest-end phone is far more expensive, but Xiaomi matches or beats it spec-for-spec except on the battery and the camera. The S21 might be the better all-around phone for people who can afford it, but if I lived in Europe, I know which one I’d consider to be a better value for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZmGHw"&gt;That’s the rub, though. At this point, Europe is one of the few places where Xiaomi and Samsung actually compete with one another at the high end. Until that changes, flagship Android phone buyers in the US won’t have much reason to consider Xiaomi part of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KVnynN"&gt;The Mi 11 isn’t a phone so spectacular that I would urge you to jump through import hoops in order to acquire one. It’s just a very good phone that will be an extremely compelling option in any market where it’s sold. If you happen to live in one of them, it has my strong recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Moto 360 may have a Snapdragon 4100</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSFYr5gKrmUlk40xubhYtoYT0nY=/0x117:1534x1140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68908525/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_5.20.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://cebrands.ca/CEBrands-CorporatePresentation.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CE Brands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dy8XVs"&gt;A planned Motorola-branded Wear OS smartwatch with Qualcomm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;new Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor&lt;/a&gt; may have leaked (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/02/moto-360-wear-os-snapdragon-4100/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If the photos are real and not just renders, it could be a sign that the next Moto 360 (or whatever it’s called) could perform significantly better than the last, and may reap some of the efficiency gains brought by the jump from a 28nm process to a 12nm one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvDKoR"&gt;The 2019 Moto 360 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21162829/moto-360-review-smartwatch-third-gen-wearos-specs-features-price"&gt;used a Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor&lt;/a&gt;, which was only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/10/17820350/snapdragon-wear-3100-wear-os-smartwatch-chip-qualcomm-android"&gt;a minor update to 2016’s 2100&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Qualcomm’s claims that the new(ish) 4100 has an 85 percent faster CPU, two-and-a-half times faster GPU, and 25 percent more battery life, it seems like there’s &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/24/ticwatch-pro-3-wear-os-specs-price-release-date/"&gt;only one watch on the market&lt;/a&gt; that actually has the chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0mwCD"&gt;The image that shows the potential watch (and which also seems to show a wireless charging coil) was found in an investor presentation alongside three other smartwatches. The unnamed watch has some text on the back, and when Reddit user TheMacJezza &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/lvvj9h/new_moto_watch_backplate_text_blown_up_names/"&gt;zoomed and enhanced&lt;/a&gt;, they saw that it appeared to say “Snapdragon Wear 4100.” I’m no logician, but that would seem to imply that this Mystery Moto has a Snapdragon Wear 4100 in it (especially considering that the current Moto 360 has its processor name printed on the back as well).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AnqvjNJ3cE0fDBOq7gPmbcmQ_wM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343961/4ex7c9o25kk61.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unnamed Motorola watch, with some contrast tweaks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qDs8Dt"&gt;Motorola doesn’t actually make Moto-branded smartwatches itself. The name was licensed to a company called eBuyNow, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20936958/moto-360-third-gen-smartwatch-ebuynow-licensing-price-specs-features"&gt;released the third-generation Moto 360&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. eBuyNow later merged with another company called CE Brands, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/26/new-moto-wear-os/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which earlier reported on an investor presentation containing details of the Moto-branded hardware roadmap for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1ejN9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article previously implied Moto-branded smartwatches were still made by Motorola; it has been updated to reflect that the brand is licensed out. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Nintendo Switch with 7-inch OLED screen coming this year, says report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YltHUuEp7__QphXUADx3S2uY-Q8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68908501/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0094.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pZGlH0"&gt;Nintendo is planning to release an upgraded model of the Switch this year with an OLED screen, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/nintendo-plans-switch-model-with-bigger-samsung-oled-display"&gt;new report in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The report says Samsung Display is providing the screen, which will be a 7-inch 720p rigid OLED panel set to go into mass production this June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFX90m"&gt;The current Switch has a 6.2-inch 720p LCD panel, while the Switch Lite’s screen is a 5.5-inch 720p LCD. Many Switch games struggle to hit native resolution in handheld mode, so the lack of an upgrade in resolution isn’t really a surprise. Bloomberg’s report does note, however, that the new Switch model will be capable of 4K graphics when hooked up to a TV, so the decision to stick with 720p in handheld mode could also be about preserving battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWSH7U"&gt;The report doesn’t state a possible release date for the new Switch, but Bloomberg’s sources say that it’ll come in time for the holidays and that the displays will start shipping to assemblers around July. The initial monthly target is said to be “just under a million units;” if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22259836/nintendo-3q-2020-earning-switch-sales-record"&gt;the last holiday season&lt;/a&gt; is anything to go by, Nintendo will want to make as many consoles as it possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX lands Starship prototype for the first time — and then it blows up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqSO4oMvrQNpZH6BCNCyKVF3wCA=/190x0:1780x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68906793/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_6.23.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SN10 standing upright after landing | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DrekpF"&gt;SpaceX’s latest Starship prototype landed on Wednesday for the first time after carrying out a high-altitude test flight in Texas — but exploded minutes later on its landing pad. The rocket, an early test version called SN10, demonstrated a few complex dances in mid-air before clinching a soft touch down, aiming to nail a key milestone in Elon Musk’s campaign to build a fully reusable rocket system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqcVk1"&gt;After aborting an initial launch attempt earlier in the day, the prototype lifted off at 6:14pm ET and soared 6 miles above SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities. Unlike the last two tests with SN8 and SN9, which launched successfully but exploded on their landing attempts, SN10 stuck a lopsided landing on a slab of concrete not far from its launchpad, appearing to survive its daring landing maneuver for a few moments before being consumed in a fireball.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A SpaceX Starship prototype explodes on the pad" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZZAN-d2GwJELQwl55wm69XrK3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343794/boom.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA Spaceflight&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yaAJux"&gt;The launch test’s main objective was to demonstrate the computer-controlled movements of the rocket’s four aerodynamic flaps that steer its descent before landing, SpaceX engineer and live stream host John Insprucker said during the company’s broadcast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzkMcM"&gt;At the end of its climb to 6.2 miles, each of the the rocket’s three Raptor engines gradually shut down to prepare for a brief free-fall back to land, reorienting itself horizontally with its “belly” facing the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fg5zAm"&gt;Then came the “belly flop” maneuver. The rocket’s three engines reignited to swoop itself into a vertical position for landing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bD8BTD"&gt;SN10 slowly descended on its landing pad, softly touching down but leaning slightly to the side. Insprucker declared it a success on SpaceX’s live feed: “Third time’s a charm, as the saying goes. We’ve had a successful soft touchdown on the landing pad.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qHDWP"&gt;“As a reminder, the key point of today’s test flight was to gather the data on controlling the vehicle while reentering, and we were successful in doing so,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peak Design congratulates Amazon for copying its signature sling bag so well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlQADBn7bFBt3TqVikCrW0nUkKQ=/636x0:4284x2432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68906567/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_11.08.14_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Peak Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91sTrL"&gt;Peak Design, a maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/26/16031314/verge-editors-choice-peak-design-everyday-backpack"&gt;fine bags and accessories&lt;/a&gt;, has a problem: Amazon appears to have copied its popular bag, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Everyday-Sling-Ash/dp/B07ZTQNBMX/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=amazonbasics+everyday+sling&amp;amp;qid=1614799442&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzS05XRllWWTU2MDNUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDQ1ODczMkZMTUlVMTVQU0dYUSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODkwMDAwM0FHUE5RTzhCTTVZNSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.95 Everyday Sling&lt;/a&gt;, with its own &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Everyday-Sling-Inches-Black/dp/B084CG43XD/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=amazonbasics+everyday+sling&amp;amp;qid=1614799394&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$32.99 Amazon Basics Camera Bag&lt;/a&gt;. It was even called Everyday Sling until Peak Design’s video. Rather than do anything drastic, yet, Peak Design &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbxWGjQ2szQ"&gt;decided to make a video&lt;/a&gt; about what customers “gain” by purchasing Amazon’s version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XItoh"&gt;The video presents Peak’s case clearly: the bags are similarly shaped, with pockets, labels, and straps in the exact same places. As someone unfamiliar with Peak Design’s bags, if I wasn’t paying attention or didn’t read “Peak Design” on the label, I’d probably mix them up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_mRdyQO6sby6eidXXOILDKOMqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343026/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_11.08.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peak Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Basics Everyday Sling on the left and Peak Design’s Everyday Sling on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kWoFhF"&gt;Peak presents all of this humorously, but the evidence is surprisingly blatant, which makes Amazon’s apparent decision to change its Amazon Basics version from “Everyday Sling” to “Amazon Basics Camera Bag” all the more suspicious. There’s even evidence: “Everyday Sling” is still in the URL for the “Camera Bag.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaKFqD"&gt;Peak Design isn’t the first smaller company to try to stand up to Amazon. When Allbirds discovered Amazon was selling what looked like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/9/19/20874818/amazon-allbirds-shoe-clone-copy-sneaker-206-collective-private-label"&gt;a pretty obvious Allbirds clone&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO wrote &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@joeyzwillinger/dear-mr-bezos-e691f6d6d705"&gt;a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; criticizing Amazon, even though he claimed he was “flattered” by the similarities between the shoes. Amazon’s copying hasn’t stopped there. The company’s also been accused of cloning car trunk organizers and seat cushions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bPtP4Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10372737"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8wgAfF"&gt;The whole trend has only served to draw attention to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;potential antitrust issue that’s long concerned the company’s critics&lt;/a&gt;, as well as lawmakers and regulators. The basic problem: Amazon owns and operates its e-commerce platform and also runs an ever-growing list of in-house brands that compete against Amazon’s own third-party Marketplace sellers on that same platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgao5a"&gt;Undercutting the competition is as simple, in theory, as seeing what’s selling well, creating a similar, cheaper product, and then suggesting it to Amazon shoppers. In fact, that very situation is at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;heart of a European Union investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the company’s operations, which resulted in the European Commission accusing Amazon of “systematically” using seller data to unfairly compete against its own merchants in France and Germany last November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3Wa0G"&gt;Amazon says it has a policy in place to prevent third-party seller data from being used for products, but &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;reporting from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests it’s still happened. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akz48p/jeff-bezos-has-no-idea-how-often-amazon-rips-off-its-sellers"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, even former CEO Jeff Bezos was unable to confirm if the policy had been broken during the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation into Amazon’s monopoly status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwaCjY"&gt;In Peak Design’s case, the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it believes Amazon has actually infringed on its intellectual property, but it chose to make the video to highlight the differences between the products and has no plans to take legal action now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMKNJt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/error?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;channel=glance-detail&amp;amp;asin=B084CG43XD"&gt;Reviews are currently disabled&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon’s bag because the company noticed “unusual reviewing activity.” Looking at some of the newest reviews, several of the lowest ratings have been left by customers directly referencing Peak Design’s video. Taken with Amazon’s decision to change the product’s name, it seems like Peak Design has struck a cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4A2RJb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Amazon about Peak Design’s claim and we will update if we receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tells Texas it wants to create 1,800 jobs with a $17 billion factory in Austin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFCWVqYcfrRqy8s4GTOBE1bfF7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68906140/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FvzK76"&gt;Samsung has submitted paperwork to Texas officials, requesting a billion dollars in tax incentives to make Austin the future home of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243994/samsung-chipmaking-texas-plant-3nm-10-billion-report"&gt;$17 billion chip factory&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-03/samsung-details-plans-for-17-billion-chip-facility-in-u-s?utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and reported last month by &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/02/04/samsung-austin-expansion-chip-plant-seeks-1-billion-taxpayer-incentives/4309503001/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Austin American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://assets.comptroller.texas.gov/ch313/1554/1554-manor-samsung-app.pdf"&gt;In the documents&lt;/a&gt;, which were filed in January, the company says it plans on bringing 1,800 permanent jobs to the factory over the first 10 years, with an average starting salary around $66K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDrkFB"&gt;In return, Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/02/04/samsung-austin-expansion-chip-plant-seeks-1-billion-taxpayer-incentives/4309503001/"&gt;asking for a break on its property taxes&lt;/a&gt;: it’s looking for a 100 percent break on its payments to Travis County for 20 years, which the company estimates would save it roughly $718 million, and a 50 percent break on the taxes to the City of Austin for five years, with an estimated $87 million. It also wants the state to subsidize its property tax payments to the school district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MndPp"&gt;It seems like Samsung is still trying to decide where to put the factory: in the documents, the company calls the project “highly competitive,” and says that “[d]ue to the higher tax cost of operating in Texas, the appraised value limitation is a determining factor. Without the appraised value limitation award, the company would likely locate the project in Arizona, New York or Korea.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlN5Rw"&gt;If Samsung chooses Austin, it would be expanding its existing plant there — the company already has a chip-making fab in the city, which has been there since 1997. The factory currently employs around 10,000 people, and the &lt;em&gt;Austin American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/02/04/samsung-austin-expansion-chip-plant-seeks-1-billion-taxpayer-incentives/4309503001/"&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; Samsung has recently bought 257.7 acres of land near its existing factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9ZIyW"&gt;Looking for incentives from cities and states is nothing new, but Samsung is asking for quite a lot, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323977/austin-tesla-tax-breaks-travis-county-cybertruck-factory-incentives"&gt;compared to Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, which is also building a factory in Austin: the car manufacturer only got around $60 million in tax rebates from the county and school district. The two planned factories aren’t directly comparable due to differences in cost, employment numbers and salaries, and more, but Samsung’s still looking for an order of magnitude more than Tesla received. It could be that Samsung used the billion-dollar figure as an opening negotiation, but any deals being worked on don’t yet seem to be public.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Losing YouTube on the old Apple TV underscores how far ahead competitors are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgNgIDxQvifYJQMBBbMX2HPZt3s=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905907/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktv7q8"&gt;The YouTube app on older Apple TV models has officially been discontinued as of today. If you have a third-generation device (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/14/2870779/apple-tv-review-2012"&gt;the 2012-era model&lt;/a&gt; that predated the modern tvOS-based set-top boxes), you’ll only be able to stream YouTube through an iOS device using AirPlay starting today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbm3Xl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;While the news&lt;/a&gt; has been known for a while, the change highlights a key issue with the Apple TV ecosystem. Namely, that it’s been nearly three and a half years since Apple has last updated its streaming box hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YzIXC"&gt;If you own the old model with the now defunct YouTube app, your only Apple-made options are the 2017 Apple TV 4K or what Apple now calls the Apple TV HD, the older model from 2015. That’s particularly problematic, given that the Apple TV 4K still starts at $179 (with a pricier 64GB model that offers double the storage for $199), despite being released years ago. Even the Apple TV HD still costs $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xL6HP2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="131UHf"&gt;That’s in stark comparison to competitors like Amazon, Google, and Roku, which have released newer streaming products that offer the same (if not better) features than Apple’s outdated box at far lower prices. Roku’s flagship streaming box, the Roku Ultra, costs $99 — nearly half the price of the entry-level Apple TV 4K — while supporting 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Apple’s own AirPlay 2 streaming. The $50 Streaming Stick Plus offers 4K and HDR (without Dolby Vision) for those looking to save even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzpZWk"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 and offers similar high-end streaming specs, while also doubling as a full-fledged Echo speaker. Like Roku, Amazon also has its cheaper $50 Fire TV Stick 4K, which offers the full gamut of streaming support (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, and HDR10) without the added Alexa speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4oWWs"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s latest Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, which costs just $50, offers excellent content curation, supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision, and remains &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best choice for a streaming stick in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Khq9Gq"&gt;With more and more apps starting to end support for Apple’s older streaming boxes (CBS All Access has already announced that it’ll be enacting a similar change when Paramount Plus launches), the problem of the Apple TV’s outdated hardware and pricing are only going to continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPkleZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article previously stated that Apple’s only remaining TV hardware was the Apple TV 4K. It has been updated to reflect that Apple still sells the older Apple TV HD. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
