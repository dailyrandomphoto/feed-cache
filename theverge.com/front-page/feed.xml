  &lt;p id="yhHXHw"&gt;During Samsung’s Unpacked event, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;unveiled three new phones&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Galaxy S21 lineup — the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra — which will be available to preorder starting January 14th and will release on January 29th. As a reminder, their prices range from $999.99 to upward of $$1,379.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 doesn’t support Samsung Pay’s most convenient feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8fInbBkh7rTQvF1eJKfLxl7v_zE=/0x45:1067x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669092/SamsungPayMST.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hW6Fdv"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; no longer support the convenient Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) feature of Samsung Pay. And based on &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/14/samsung-pay-is-losing-its-one-remaining-good-feature-on-the-galaxy-s21/"&gt;what the company told &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the same will be true for all phones that Samsung releases from here on out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa4LC1"&gt;If you’re not familiar, &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/mst/#:~:text=Magnetic%20Secure%20Transmission%2C%20or%20MST,that%20helps%20power%20Samsung%20Pay.&amp;amp;text=Accepted%20at%20nearly%20all%20payment,Pay%20also%20supports%20NFC%20payments." rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MST is a very cool trick&lt;/a&gt; that allows Samsung phones to send out a magnetic pulse that made payment terminals think that you’d swiped a regular credit card. The most beneficial thing about it is that MST can work in scenarios where NFC payments aren’t available. It can send that magnetic signal to pretty much any payment terminal with a traditional card swiper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YI6mpl"&gt;MST is by no means perfect: getting a payment to go through on the first try can sometimes be a challenge, and it’s worthless in situations where you have to stick your card all the way into a slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTAnqH"&gt;But now it’s a goner, with Samsung believing that NFC adoption has reached a point where it can phase out the MST aspect of Samsung Pay. “Due to the rapid adoption of near field communication (NFC) technology by consumers and businesses, beginning with devices launched in 2021, Samsung Pay will focus its support on NFC transactions, across the Galaxy portfolio,” Samsung said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Android Police.&lt;/em&gt; “While future devices will no longer include magnetic stripe technology (MST), customers with previous, compatible Galaxy devices will be able to continue using Samsung Pay, including MST.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jR2kM"&gt;Samsung phones as recent as the Galaxy S20 FE still had MST capabilities built in, so you don’t have to go far back to find a compatible device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l67Tqb"&gt;This means with the Galaxy S21 family, Samsung has now gotten rid of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W98UH5"&gt;The charging brick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jfuZL1"&gt;microSD storage expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vZrE0Z"&gt;MST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3u7I9D"&gt;I get the sense that a lot of people won’t mind losing some (or all) of those things — especially with the lower starting prices on the S21 and S21 Plus — but there’s no denying that Samsung Pay just lost what was maybe its best standout trick. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>QHD screens might be the best thing to happen to gaming laptops in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade Pro 17" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6YOmYo3ri00-TllPvytBfgjU9U=/0x0:1028x685/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668957/blade17pro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CPtUfp"&gt;One of the biggest announcements at CES 2021 seemed to come and go without much fanfare. Overshadowed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;Nvidia’s debut of its RTX 3000-series graphics chips&lt;/a&gt; for laptops, you might have missed hearing that a growing number of manufacturers are &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;building fast-refreshing QHD screens into their portable gaming machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhWj1D"&gt;Standalone QHD (1440p) monitors are a popular choice for discerning gamers who use desktop computers for several reasons. First, the displays are often more affordable and feature-packed than most 4K monitors while looking nearly as good. And importantly, modern high-end graphics cards, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; (and even some last-gen products), run games &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;well at QHD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs2CaM"&gt;Frustratingly and inexplicably, though, QHD hasn’t been an option if you want one built into your gaming laptop. You’ve had a choice of either 1080p or 4K or the option to output to a 1440p monitor that you purchase separately. That’s changing for 2021, and perhaps at the perfect time, as machines powered by RTX 3000-series and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227144/amd-rdna-2-gpu-gaming-laptops-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;AMD’s incoming RDNA 2&lt;/a&gt; graphics chips will take full advantage of QHD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Adsbv9PNMSXX0CVgZgU9SftO34U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227494/nitro52021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 has the option for a QHD display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xd5Q0"&gt;I’m still of the opinion that 1080p looks &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; for most use cases, but I won’t argue that displaying games in 1080p with relatively smooth performance is a low hurdle for even midrange laptop hardware to clear. On the other hand, playing the latest AAA games at 4K resolution with all of the graphical settings set to max is at once impressive and mediocre, with frame rates frequently dipping into the unplayable zone. QHD screens in powerful laptops can offer great visual fidelity with hardware that should have no issue keeping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bntovv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15&lt;/a&gt; is one of a few laptops announced at CES 2021 that will let you add a QHD screen to your order, and I was pleased to see that doing so won’t add all that much to the grand total. For $2,199 ($200 more than the model that features an FHD 144Hz panel), you get a machine with a QHD IPS screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, along with the new Nvidia RTX 3070 and a six-core 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor. This price is on par with many current laptops equipped with last-gen parts and a fast-refreshing 1080p screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BmfoZ"&gt;In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised to see gaming laptops with QHD screens falling below the sub-$2K price point this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218681/acer-nitro-5-gaming-laptop-intel-11th-tiger-lake-h35-amd-ryzen-rtx-3080-qhd-release-date-price"&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 for 2021&lt;/a&gt; will also have the option to be configured with a QHD screen, and I’m sure many other OEMs will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SXe78T"&gt;I’m not yet able to tell you what kind of performance Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series delivers on new laptops until later in the month. But if you’re used to gaming on a 1080p monitor, seeing it all running on a more pixel-dense QHD screen could be revelatory. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart will give shoppers $25 when they take time off to get the coronavirus vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instacart" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3LSRsQ0lRZMbk9uLosBwlHwUaes=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668708/1084202690.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zvm8GN"&gt;Instacart will give its shoppers — the workers who pick and fill grocery store orders for customers — a $25 stipend for the time they take off to get a coronavirus vaccine, the company announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMIaS8"&gt;Beginning February 1st, any full-service Instacart shopper in North America who has shopped at least five batches — which can include one or more customer orders — in the past 30 days and can also verify they have received a vaccine will be eligible. Shift leads and in-store shoppers who are actively employed when they receive the vaccine will be eligible as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJzHnJ"&gt;The company says the $25 is intended to provide shoppers with financial assistance as they take time away from shopping. &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/instacart-shopper-make-money"&gt;Full-service shoppers&lt;/a&gt; are independent contractors who both pick and deliver groceries, while in-store shoppers are part-time Instacart employees who do in-store shopping only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5ObeiU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company wants its workers to receive priority vaccine access&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AAtfvj"&gt;Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta said in a statement the company is taking “proactive steps to advocate that government agencies recognize Instacart shoppers as critical essential workers who deserve early access to vaccines.” It’s joined by other gig economy companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167583/uber-driver-early-access-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, DoorDash, and Lyft that &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/instacart-vaccine-workers-gig-companies-335d1695-d903-40af-b09e-c6d1426832d0.html"&gt;have lobbied for their independent contractors&lt;/a&gt; to receive priority vaccine access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1t2tyi"&gt;Instacart, which does not provide medical benefits for its independent contractor shoppers, has unveiled several initiatives to demonstrate it is attempting to protect its workers from becoming infected with COVID-19, but with mixed results. Under an agreement with the attorney general for Washington, DC in June, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21278359/instacart-sick-pay-gig-workers-dc-ag-telemedicine-childcare"&gt;expanded its sick pay benefit&lt;/a&gt; to anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 by a health care provider, even without a positive test, and provided a telemedicine option through Doctor on Demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Suh0Ph"&gt;Instacart also said it would provide sick pay to shoppers who live with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. However, shoppers have reported that the application &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"&gt;process to receive sick pay has been difficult to navigate&lt;/a&gt; and the benefit was not always approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JCWVU"&gt;In March 2020, the company announced its plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/29/21198986/instacart-hand-sanitizer-shoppers-strike-coronavirus"&gt;distribute health and safety kits&lt;/a&gt; to its shoppers, which include a washable face mask and hand sanitizer. It says it’s delivered more than 620,000 of the kits to shoppers via its app and website, but again, shoppers have described a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/18/21226481/instacart-shoppers-safety-kits-coronavirus-masks"&gt;complicated process for receiving the kits&lt;/a&gt;. The kits were announced just as a group of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@GigWorkersCollective/instacart-emergency-walk-off-ebdf11b6995a"&gt;Instacart shoppers staged a strike&lt;/a&gt; to push the company for better protective gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ1J4TN8G-1610581727.039400-thread-list_1610581754.040300"&gt;In June, Instacart announced it was changing the way it handled customer tips, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274540/instacart-tip-baiting-deceptive-shoppers-ftc-investigation-congress"&gt;announcement of a congressional inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the practice of tip-baiting. That’s when a customer rescinds or reduces a shopper’s tips after their order has been shopped and delivered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to deactivate your Twitter account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter-app-stock-Dec2015-verge-05" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oRXixVcQuYbKG2f8J43m-eai0nM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668682/Twitter-app-stock-Dec2015-verge-05.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTAiqb"&gt;There’s no questioning the benefits of Twitter. It’s a convenient way to get your memes, world news, and pop culture hot takes all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYyM65"&gt;But being an active Twitter user requires sifting through a daily deluge of toxic characters, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226503/twitter-qanon-account-suspension-70000-capitol-riots"&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/5/30/18645004/twitter-white-supremacy-research-nazi-ban-gadde-dorsey"&gt;white supremacists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147096/twitter-bot-thought-leaders-ai-venture-capital-real-human-language"&gt;bots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145827/twitter-test-misinformation-politicians-tweets"&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;, and more (although you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;can’t find Donald Trump there any more&lt;/a&gt;). Plus, there’s no denying the stress and anxiety that the fast pace of Twitter’s news cycle, and the strain of constantly debating reply guys, can bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkRgnr"&gt;Hear me out on this: you don’t actually have to use Twitter. I know it might seem like everyone else is using it, but you can be the change you want to see in the world. You can just delete your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ikj35m"&gt;Don’t worry: it doesn’t have to be permanent. If you find yourself feeling empty and directionless after doing this, you can get your account back up to 30 days after the fact. But if it ever gets to be too much again, just come back to this article and follow the steps. There’s a whole world outside of your timeline to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="r5FE88"&gt;Deactivate your Twitter account in a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ymkgC4"&gt;If you’re on a computer or in a mobile browser, go to &lt;a href="http://Twitter.com"&gt;Twitter.com&lt;/a&gt; and log in to your account. To deactivate: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SaQ0Gk"&gt;On the web, click the “More” item on the bottom-left of the screen. On the mobile browser, tap your profile icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dTd7QL"&gt;Select “Settings and Privacy” and then “Your account”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Settings and Privacy” and then “Your account” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhMlkSnOwPg7m258g2nO7-KvI84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235732/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_12.52.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Settings and Privacy” and then “Your account.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KzWYhW"&gt;At the bottom of the list, tap “Deactivate your account”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At the bottom of the list, tap “Deactivate your account” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LitA3jIQZVaxs3NSYRlmbS_cko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235744/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_12.55.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the bottom of the list, tap “Deactivate your account.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="7UxMcI"&gt;Go to the bottom of the page to find the “Deactivate” link&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1jEiWI"&gt;There’s going to be a lot of information on the page before you get to that link, some of it pretty useful. There’s a full description of what will no longer be viewable (your display name, @username, and public profile), an assurance that you can restore your account “for some time” if it was accidentally or wrongfully deleted, and a way to reactivate after 30 days or 12 months (useful if you’re being besieged and want to take a vacation from Twitter rather than delete your account entirely). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are a lot of options to choose from before you reach the “Deactivate” link." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtAaV6R7_sMNjeMkOZ2IsY6INxI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235751/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_11.06.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are a lot of options to choose from before you reach the “Deactivate” link.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="coUwfO"&gt;There are also links if you just want to change your name, use your current name with a different account, or download your Twitter data. This last one is always a good idea before you delete any account; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data"&gt;here’s the link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OS6jMH"&gt;Deactivate your Twitter account in the Twitter app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WI5dGE"&gt;If you’re using a smartphone, go to the Twitter app and make sure you’re logged in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oQJUEj"&gt;Tap the three-line hamburger icon in the top-left corner. A menu will pop out from the side. Tap “Settings and privacy” on the bottom. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egstsW"&gt;Tap “Account” at the top. In the account settings page, select “Deactivate your account” at the bottom &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YtgEPI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9139315"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MQHpZx"&gt;A few things to note: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gRqd7k"&gt;To reiterate: your account won’t be permanently gone after this process. Twitter retains your information for 30 days before deleting it permanently. To restore your account, just log back in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RPMWaZ"&gt;If you plan to create a new Twitter account with the same username and email address as the account you’re deactivating, switch the current account to a different username and email address before you deactivate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B1jAzJ"&gt;If you want to download your Twitter data, do that &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; deactivating. Twitter can’t send data from inactive accounts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qQfvC8"&gt;Google and other search engines cache results, meaning your old profile and tweets may still pop up in response to search queries on occasion. However, anyone who clicks them will get an error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aSkgiw"&gt;Deactivating your account can be a hassle, but to Twitter’s credit, it’s much more straightforward than the process of deleting some other services, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145313/uber-lyft-delete-apps-how-to-ethical-transportation-ride-share"&gt;Uber and Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d8VNLq"&gt;But where will I get my news and memes now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WsSkop"&gt;So Twitter is gone from your life. Congratulations! But what will you do now that you don’t have a never-ending barrage of tweets to scroll through? Here are some other things to try with your newfound free time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="I7sgQI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastodon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Mastodon is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use"&gt;decentralized version of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which journalists have praised as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/783akg/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it"&gt;“Twitter without Nazis.”&lt;/a&gt; Rather than one giant hot mess of a website, you log in to different “instances” of Mastodon, which are communities with varying purposes and themes. Instead of tweets, you post “toots,” and they have a 500-character limit. There’s also a built-in content warning feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OLU8Wp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; There are certainly some toxic places on Reddit, but unlike Twitter, you’re not forced to pay attention to them. You can follow and subscribe to subreddits about anything that strikes your interest, from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/furby/"&gt;Furbies&lt;/a&gt;. Each subreddit has a clear set of rules, and they’re usually enforced. And if you get tired of a subreddit, you can leave it without leaving the website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DqAlcx"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tumblr is similar to Twitter in many ways, but it has a couple of key differences. For one, follower counts aren’t public, so certain members aren’t privileged over others in discussions or debates because of their audience’s size. Replies to other people’s posts don’t show up on your feed, so you don’t have to watch other users’ arguments devolve. And there’s no character limit, so you can add some nuance to the opinions you post. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E72XBD"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yes, there are a lot of horrible, terrible, no good, very bad things about Facebook. But if you miss the ability to keep up with family and friends on Twitter, you can do that on Facebook, too. You won’t be constrained by the character limit, and you won’t have to worry about anyone outside of your friends list seeing your content. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YPYT1z"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Newspapers.&lt;/strong&gt; This might shock you, but plenty of media companies still sell physical newspapers and magazines. You can pick them up at newsstands, bookstores, coffee shops, and even have them delivered right to your mailbox if you buy a subscription. Rather than being bombarded all day, you’ll get your news in a digestible chunk each morning. The best part: you’ll look cool and sophisticated to everyone around you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XzW8SJ"&gt;Just go to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Don’t worry. We’re always here for you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The Overwatch League’s 2021 season will start in April</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch League Grand Finals 2019" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AVm7JbkUt3km5UMLm7T_sMKIK8=/47x0:5185x3425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668384/1184730833.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hunter Martin/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fcgHz1"&gt;For its first three years of existence, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League has kicked off early in the year. But that’s going to change in 2021. Today, Blizzard announced that its ambitious esports league will begin play in April. It will also be the first season in which the league starts off with remote matches — and there will be some big changes to accommodate that. “To take full advantage of what was learned last season, we’ve made several changes that will improve the quality of competition and the fan experience for this coming season,” Blizzard says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbr3J1"&gt;First is a structural change. Blizzard says the 20-team league will be split into two divisions — one made of teams from China and Korea, the other North America and Europe — and they’ll play against other teams in their region during the regular season. The top teams from each division will then qualify for four major tournaments that will happen throughout the season. (Full details and scheduling aren’t available just yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QNeXHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the Overwatch League’s remote production studio","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229380/overwatch-league-remote-cloud-production-studio-esports-blizzard"},{"title":"When the Overwatch League moved online, fans found new ways to connect","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21428863/overwatch-league-fans-discord-watch-parties-pandemic"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ovmQUS"&gt;OWL features teams from 19 cities that are spread across North America, Europe, and Asia, and Blizzard says that it’s developing a new tool to make it possible to play across regions. It’s described as “a new system that establishes minimum latency connections so that teams anywhere in the world can scrimmage against one another or conduct practices if players are apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NO5W40"&gt;The league’s first season was in 2018, but last year was expected to be a big one for OWL; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122974/overwatch-league-season-3-preview-youtube-hero-pool-china-travel"&gt;the league was going to move to a home-and-away format&lt;/a&gt;, similar to traditional sports leagues, with teams playing out of venues in their home cities. Those plans were disrupted by the pandemic, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229380/overwatch-league-remote-cloud-production-studio-esports-blizzard"&gt;Blizzard eventually shifting to an online format&lt;/a&gt;, which continued through to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505843/overwatch-league-owl-grand-finals-2020-schedule-youtube"&gt;the championship game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TMx4aG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6WtAKGz1r4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMXq5u"&gt;The other controversial change in 2020 saw the league shift its broadcast from Twitch to YouTube, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21080731/youtube-activision-blizzard-exclusive-streaming-e-sports-league"&gt;Activision Blizzard signed an exclusive streaming deal with Google&lt;/a&gt;. The change came with a decline in viewership, though OWL says it’s planning to improve broadcasts for this upcoming season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K827Pb"&gt;For our fans, we’re working very closely with YouTube as we enter the second year of our partnership. There are a lot of things in the works that we can’t reveal yet, but we can say that we’re going to level up the quality of our match streams, add more value to watching live matches, and improve the discoverability of live &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1K0dsJ"&gt;We’re also making improvements to our match broadcasts with a new and improved virtual set, a freshly redesigned graphics package, and changes to our show format that place even more emphasis on match play. We’ll have more to share on this later in the offseason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jycXYz"&gt;And while the league is planning for a season of largely remote competition, Blizzard also isn’t ruling out a return to live matches in the future. “While we cannot predict the future, we hope to welcome fans back to live events &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; health and safety conditions improve in 2021, but that might not happen, and it might not be at every location where teams compete,” the league said in a statement. “Our top priority remains to keep our players, fans, and staff safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sPBqg"&gt;Yesterday, Activision announced that OWL’s sister league, the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226670/call-of-duty-cod-league-cdl-esports-2021-season-start-date-youtube"&gt;would begin play in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wg1Mm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll never believe it, Samsung made a black phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fF3uCp8D1dcO1E7uQvdfXxfojKY=/33x0:1047x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668285/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_8.11.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQrXei"&gt;Samsung’s just announced a ton of new products: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s latest flagship and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;SmartTags&lt;/a&gt; are a Tile and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;(maybe) Apple AirTags&lt;/a&gt; competitor. But the real innovation, the thing that Samsung spent almost three minutes waxing poetically about during its 2021 Unpacked presentation, was the color black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIiEBE"&gt;Specifically, “phantom black,” the company’s “new” version of black for the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. A black that Samsung describes as “strong, fluid, and modern,” and also “unapologetic,” “resonant,” and “unforgettable,” despite looking more or less like the black phones Samsung’s rolled out almost every year. Call it Samsung entering its Adult Goth phase or maybe just a way to pad out a presentation that was light on news. You can get a glimpse of Samsung’s... passion for the color in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q7sbp7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQtVzO1Rs_w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYMgbk"&gt;“When it comes to design” the video’s serious disembodied designer voice starts, “black isn’t just a color, it’s all colors in one.” In terms of art, that’s accurate, as to print something in black requires multiple “subtractive colors” (like magenta or yellow) combined together, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fdesign%2Fdiscover%2Fis-black-a-color.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F14%2F22230934%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Adobe&lt;/a&gt;. In the world of physics, black is the absence of light, but Samsung’s “haze glass” covered take isn’t quite shine free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS6tOq"&gt;The style of the video takes the exact same, “I just discovered this” tone of Apple’s design videos, specifically Apple’s Jony Ive-voiced explanation of the jet black version of the iPhone 7. It’s an overview of processes that any phone would go through to be finished with color, but delivered with the reverence of someone explaining their method of curing the common cold. Self-satisfied might be an inaccurate description for the traditionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4106268/watch-this-samsungs-complete-and-completely-weird-galaxy-s4"&gt;weird Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, but it gets mighty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q890np"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEh0cJCwmTc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcH6Lm"&gt;Samsung apparently journeyed through the worlds of fashion, automobiles, and art to settle on its version of the color, which should look like, well, black, from every angle with minimal glare. It’s a “quest” that maybe didn’t need to happen, or at least, didn’t need to be immortalized in video, especially because the “experience” of black can be found by standing in a dark room, closing your eyes, or &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/products/mobile/phones/galaxy-s/galaxy-s20-ultra-5g-128gb-at-t-sm-g988uzkaatt/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;looking at an S20 from last year&lt;/a&gt;. But Samsung’s specific, serious (is it serious? I’ve watched the video multiple times and am no longer sure) consideration of the color and choice of name seems like a deliberate attempt to connect a smartphone to a real scientific breakthrough: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20813054/vantablack-ultrablack-black-material-surrey-nanosystems-carbon-nanotubes-science-materials"&gt;Vantablack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUOgyE"&gt;Vantablack is an “ultrablack” material made from carbon nanotubes that was discovered by accident in the pursuit of other, potentially more useful scientific breakthroughs. Nanotubes could one day fortify space equipment or act as a futuristic conductive material, but for now they’re about as useful as Samsung’s video explaining the color black. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll soon be able to upload files as big as 250GB to OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and SharePoint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZjxI5EKXYG9PrhIOM9Xteo5Ex4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668241/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jrCvz"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/gain-more-flexibility-with-250-gb-file-size-support-in-microsoft/ba-p/1847728?ocid=usoc_TWITTER_M365_spl100001789796125"&gt;will soon&lt;/a&gt; let you upload even bigger files to OneDrive, Teams, and SharePoint, increasing the limit from 100GB to 250GB. The bigger file size limit could be good news for people who are working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and need to upload large projects like 4K and 8K video, CAD files, or scientific datasets to the cloud so they can be shared with colleagues and clients. The change will also carry over to OneDrive for personal use, according to Microsoft, which could make it easier for you to upload large photo or video collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtWLFx"&gt;Microsoft says the 250GB file size upload limit will begin rolling out by the end of January. The company expects the new limit to be generally available by the end of this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMyNTa"&gt;This is Microsoft’s second recent increase for file upload sizes — the company upped it from 15GB to 100GB &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310182/microsoft-onedrive-teams-sharing-integration-100gb-file-upload-limit"&gt;last July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung partners with Audi, BMW, Ford, and Genesis to turn your phone into a car key</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdxL747p6uH9izPwK3kngBShjPE=/37x0:1164x751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667968/samsung_car_partnership_key.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="buyPJS"&gt;The dream of using your phone to unlock your car door (instead of carrying around a bulging key fob) may be one step closer today: Samsung has announced partnerships with Audi, BMW, Ford, and Genesis to do just that, saying the feature may be available as soon as August 2021. And excitingly, those digital car keys should work with Apple iPhones and across other Android brands, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zejfc"&gt;That’s because Samsung is part of multiple standards bodies that are working on the tech, including the Car Connectivity Consortium and the FiRa Consortium, of which Apple is also a leading member. “You’ll even be able to share your digital key across smartphones, regardless of brand or platform,” Samsung’s Kevin Chung announced during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDEZRx"&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear which automakers will support the coolest, securest version of this tech: UWB. It uses small, standardized beacon-like pulses of low-power energy, preferably from multiple parts of your car at once, to figure out exactly where you are in relation to your car’s handle from a sizable distance away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjiEwc"&gt;Samsung says with the new digital keys, “you’ll be able to unlock your car door when you reach it, no sooner, no later,” but I’m pretty sure it’s only referring to UWB there. The fallback is NFC, where you’d likely need to pull your phone out and tap it to your car, like you do with tap-to-pay NFC transactions today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VvvcJOdfgzjFCSVEpoEdCK1_ptc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235445/uwb_car_finder_samsung.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AR viewfinder for UWB-equipped phones and cars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tEHadb"&gt;Samsung also showed off how the tech can let you find your car in a crowded parking lot, with an augmented reality viewfinder it says it’s bringing to Samsung phones — but the fine print says it only works with UWB-equipped cars and UWB-enabled phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZN4xk1"&gt;Every iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 comes with UWB now, but Samsung says only the Galaxy Z Fold 2, the new S21 Plus and S21 Ultra (so, not the S21?), and the “Galaxy Note 20+” (presumably referring to the Note 20 Ultra, which has UWB) will support the AR viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAUJvz"&gt;Apple is also waiting for carmakers to adopt UWB and had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;roll out its own version of digital car keys with NFC to start&lt;/a&gt;, and only on the 2021 BMW 5 Series. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW announced earlier today&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll support UWB, branded as “Digital Key Plus,” with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;electric BMW iX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtOt6h"&gt;Samsung’s also introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;a UWB-based tracking tag for finding your lost gadgets later this year&lt;/a&gt;, though — like the car keys — it’s starting off with a less impressive Bluetooth version instead that won’t let you locate them as precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s object eraser will let you remove people from the background of your photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oGktxM7rjtUlBK9MZn9YlZw4phw=/134x0:1724x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667952/samsung_object_eraser.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8K4gq2"&gt;Samsung revealed new One UI 3 details at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;today’s Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, including an interesting new photo trick called object eraser, which lets you delete people from the backgrounds of your images. After a photo is taken, you can simply tap on the people you want to remove, and AI will (in theory) do the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7Vsoe"&gt;If it works well — and that’s a big if — this is no small feat. Removing an element from a photo and intelligently filling in the background to replace it would be similar to what Adobe does with its Content-Aware Fill tool. We wouldn’t expect this feature to perform quite on that level, but it’s a tricky problem usually left to sophisticated image editing software to solve. If Samsung can pull this off convincingly, it’ll be a good trick.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8FQ3TXVrFNJ7fLp8zaqNXg5OFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235537/Jan_14_2021_08_57_55.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q5IJu5"&gt;This feature will be available first on Samsung’s S21 series phones, but it should come to compatible Galaxy devices with an Android 11 update early this year.&lt;/p&gt;
