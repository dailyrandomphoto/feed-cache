    <title>UK carrier EE introduces EU roaming charges following Brexit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EE logo is seen at one of their stores on Oxford Street in..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5DKy0Xx0tmUb4Q_KcKgy39DZOo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498687/1233588230.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4h0YM0"&gt;UK carrier EE is introducing roaming charges for customers traveling to almost all EU countries from January next year, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57595913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The change applies to any customers who sign up or upgrade their plans after July 7th. From next year, these customers will be charged a flat fee of £2 (around $2.78) a day while in 47 “European destinations,” to get access to their plan’s existing data, minutes, and text allowances. The BT-owned carrier is also selling a 30-day Roam Abroad Pass, which is included with certain plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aJvPy"&gt;Roaming charges for UK customers visiting mainland Europe used to be commonplace until the European Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418776/eu-mobile-roaming-charges-date-june-15"&gt;outlawed the practice in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the UK’s departure from the EU, which involved a transition period that ended on December 31st 2020, UK carriers no longer have to abide by these rules. The UK’s trade deal with the EU encourages them to have “transparent and reasonable rates” for roaming, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the charges aren’t specifically prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wp67b3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fees cover 47 European destinations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="16oFbv"&gt;The 47 European destinations include EU member states, plus other locations like the Canary Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, and Vatican City. Customers will not be charged an extra fee to use their phones in the Republic of Ireland, EE says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h00Zj"&gt;EE’s decision makes it the first UK carrier to introduce roaming charges post-Brexit. It’s a marked shift from what it told &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45064268"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; in January&lt;/a&gt;, when it said that its customers “enjoy inclusive roaming in Europe and beyond” and that it didn’t “have any plans to change this based on the Brexit outcome.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Eqfl0"&gt;Competitors Three and O2 have also made changes to how much data their customers can use while in Europe, but have stopped short of introducing blanket charges for all usage. &lt;a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/06/clarifying-o2-uks-tougher-excess-data-charges-for-eu-roaming.html"&gt;O2 is adding a fair use cap&lt;/a&gt; of 25GB a month for users in the EU, while Three is reducing its existing cap from 20GB to 12GB, &lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5t4lQ"&gt;In a statement, an EE spokesperson said the charges “will support investment into our UK based customer service and leading UK network.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live blog: Microsoft’s Windows 11 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xt8ztG-s9zhEbYlxgCMpiOQutPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498586/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s time for a new Windows&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="U4FVM7"&gt;Microsoft is ready to usher in a new version of Windows, and it looks like 11 will be the magical number. After months of teasers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;Windows 11 leaked last week&lt;/a&gt; and provided us an early look at what Microsoft should announce today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wF18h"&gt;Microsoft responded to the leaks, hinting “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows/status/1404873374954758148"&gt;this is just the Start&lt;/a&gt;,” so we’re likely to see a lot more than what the early leaked build revealed. We’re expecting to hear more about Microsoft’s big plans for the Windows store, including a way to open it up to more apps and rival payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3ffT83"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 11 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543253/microsoft-windows-11-event-date-time-what-to-expect-rumors"},{"title":"Windows 11 leak reveals new UI, Start menu, and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"},{"title":"Microsoft needs to show Windows 11 is more than just Windows 10.5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548367/microsoft-windows-11-more-than-windows-10-editorial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RQ2Nkb"&gt;Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;has teased&lt;/a&gt; this next version of Windows as “one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade.” So it sounds like today’s announcements are going to be significant for Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ol68Qf"&gt;We’re here to live blog all the announcements and what are likely to be some surprises along the way. Tune in to watch along with us!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK court rules Deliveroo couriers aren’t employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Wales During The Coronavirus Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJ5l5jOo8vMzNKEJkVUQX58sqnA=/0x114:5940x4074/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498578/1323883651.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Huw Fairclough/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2M9qNQ"&gt;After several rounds in court, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deliveroo-ipo-amazon-com/amazons-deliveroo-stake-to-drop-to-11-5-after-london-ipo-idUSKBN2BF19O"&gt;Amazon-backed&lt;/a&gt; food delivery service Deliveroo has won the right to continue classifying its couriers as self-employed, CNBC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/deliveroo-stock-surges-after-court-rules-riders-are-self-employed.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6G8pK"&gt;The case concerned the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain’s attempt to unionize a portion of the service’s delivery riders operating around Camden. While law obviously differs between the US and UK, a similar throughline in these types of cases is proving (or disproving) the amount of direct control the platforms have over their contractors — the more meddling into how, where, and when generally translates to a stronger case that these workers are, in fact, misclassified employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rU9iW0"&gt;The UK Court of Appeals, however, was convinced that a newer version of the Supplier’s Agreement, which Deliveroo pushed out to couriers a few weeks before the initial case hearing in 2017, allowed enough latitude that workers could still be considered self-employed. Even still, “it is reasonable to infer that Deliveroo’s reason for making the change was to strengthen its position in the context of IWGB’s claim for recognition,” the court wrote in its opinion, since the earlier Supplier’s Agreement “involved much more control and direction by Deliveroo –strict uniform requirements, a different attitude to substitutes and in other significant respects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FI54QE"&gt;Eleventh hour terms of service changes in the face of a legal challenge are par for the course with many gig economy companies, as Uber’s own &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/06/ubers-secret-project-bolster-its-case-against-ab-californias-gig-worker-law/"&gt;“project Luigi”&lt;/a&gt; rather infamously demonstrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6mXxA"&gt;What cinched the win for Deliveroo, in this case, was it’s hands-off approach to riders subcontracting the deliveries they accepted. Even this, though, comes with a litany of caveats, as the court enumerated, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q6syKI"&gt;Notifying the company if your subcontractor is using a different vehicle than you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="12T73H"&gt;Being responsible for your subcontractor completing training through Deliveroo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mcv6sF"&gt;Being unable to subcontract someone who [emphasis ours] “previously had their Supplier Agreement terminated by Deliveroo for a serious or material breach of contract or who (while acting as a substitute, whether for you or a third party) &lt;strong&gt;has engaged in conduct which would have provided grounds for termination&lt;/strong&gt; had they been a direct party to a Supplier Agreement”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xisNuJ"&gt;A lower court also previously found that “in practice substitution is rare as there is no need for a Rider to engage a substitute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfYUXG"&gt;Nevertheless, Deliveroo had its day in court and has seemingly come out the victor, in spite of similar upsets in the UK with regard to Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnVjeO"&gt;After a protracted court battle, Uber drivers were ruled to be eligible for minimum wage, holiday time, and other benefits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;; two months later, those same drivers were able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455533/uber-union-uk-gmb-eats-labor"&gt;obtain collective bargaining rights&lt;/a&gt; and join a union — although in both cases, these wins were not extended to couriers with Uber’s Eats program. Strangely, that ruling did not seem to have any bearing on the plight of Deliveroo’s riders. The judges in the Deliveroo appeal even went so far as to say they were unaware of any “cases where persons who were not in an employment relationship had been found to fall within the scope of the trade union freedom right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fg8CCP"&gt;As with many gig economy jobs, Deliveroo has been criticized for an opaque system of payments, which led many riders to earn &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/25/some-uk-deliveroo-riders-earning-just-2-an-hour-survey-finds"&gt;well below minimum wage&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. As &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/08/deliveroo-losses-flotation-covid-ipo-london-stock-exchange"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, documents related to Deliveroo’s initial public offering revealed the company had set approximately $150 million aside as a war chest to continue fighting for non-employee status for its couriers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s wearable display glasses will go on sale in July starting in Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3b46YwLlJplTwcmzi0FDXB8izM=/0x364:2456x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498420/Product_with_Model_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s wearable display plugs directly into your phone or laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucvKEu"&gt;TCL says its wearable display will go on sale in July starting in Australia for $899 AUD (about $680 US), with more markets to follow. The company has been teasing the concept for a couple of years now and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;showed it off earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at virtual CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7SGtt"&gt;TCL calls it NxtWear G and emphasizes that it’s not a VR or AR device in its current configuration. Instead, it acts as an external display for your mobile device or laptop, with two 1080p Micro OLED panels that give the effect of looking at a 140-inch screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sTusS"&gt;The wearable display works with phones, tablets, and laptops that offer USB-C DisplayPort functionality, including recent MacBooks, iPad Pros, and Samsung S21 series phones. The glasses plug directly into your device, displaying content on a 16:9 screen in front of your eyes. The whole thing, cable included, weighs 130g (4.6oz), and stereo speakers are built into the frames, though TCL recommends using wireless earbuds or a headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2OGnU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10619182"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXcHwq"&gt;Among other global announcements timed for Mobile World Congress, TCL is announcing a new screen-sharing function for its smartphones called Multi-Screen Collaboration. At launch, it will work only with the TCL 20 Pro 5G and will allow owners of the phone to wirelessly share files, photos, clipboard content, and messages with a compatible Windows 10 laptop or PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbHahI"&gt;Photos and videos can also be shared from the phone to a TCL TV. In this mode, the phone acts as a trackpad so you can move a cursor around the TV screen to select images or clips to play. TCL says the feature will come to the 20 Pro 5G via a software update in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oszCEx7wm2XnD9KxDsmDsmS3BQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22675178/TCL_movetime.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movetime Family Watch 2 is designed for school-aged kids who aren’t quite ready for a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z8sFnG"&gt;TCL is also previewing another new wearable — one for the kids. Movetime Family Watch 2 is a kid-oriented version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419659/tcl-10-tab-max-mid-move-audio-s200-family-watch-announced"&gt;4G-enabled smartwatch designed for seniors&lt;/a&gt;. It features a 1.54-inch screen along with voice and video calling. There’s real-time location tracking and a geofencing feature, an IP65 rated housing, and up to seven days of standby time on its battery. It will be sold in Europe starting mid-August for €149.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google delays blocking third-party cookies in Chrome until 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAMeLh1lg41Lh1MMSZ_TYcAWPP0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498180/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8BlVuz"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones"&gt;announcing today that it is delaying its plans&lt;/a&gt; to phase out third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year or so later than originally planned. Other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already implemented some blocking against third-party tracking cookies, but Chrome is the most-used desktop browser, and so its shift will be more consequential for the ad industry. That’s why the term “cookiepocalypse” has taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBvFjC"&gt;In the blog post announcing the delay, Google says that decision to phase out cookies over a “three month period” in mid-2023 is “subject to our engagement with the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).” In other words, it is pinning part of the delay on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532862/google-uk-regulator-competition-and-markets-authority-privacy-sandbox-floc"&gt;its need to work more closely with regulators&lt;/a&gt; to come up with new technologies to replace third-party cookies for use in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u6ROg"&gt;Few will shed tears for Google, but it has found itself in a very difficult place as the sole company that dominates multiple industries: search, ads, and browsers. The more Google cuts off third-party tracking, the more it harms other advertising companies and potentially increases its own dominance in the ad space. The less Google cuts off tracking, the more likely it is to come under fire for not protecting user privacy. And no matter what it does, it will come under heavy fire from regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, publishers, and anybody else with any kind of stake in the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGqILa"&gt;Finding a way to balance those conflicting incentives has proven difficult to say the least. One reason is that, as a steward of the open web, Google is attempting to develop its new privacy technologies out in the open via the usual process of creating web standards. It has bundled several efforts under the rubric of a “&lt;a href="https://privacysandbox.com/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;,” a catch-all term for a bunch of different new proposals for Chrome and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDZobr"&gt;The most contentious of those proposals has been the “Federated Learning of Cohorts” technology, or FLoC. It is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;very complicated attempt&lt;/a&gt; to create groups of demographically similar users in a semi-anonymous decentralized system that advertisers could use to target ads. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387492/google-floc-ad-tech-privacy-browsers-brave-vivaldi-edge-mozilla-chrome-safari"&gt;not a single other browser vendor has signaled that it is on board with using FLoC&lt;/a&gt;, and several have explicitly said they would block it. The best response Google has really gotten is this &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-analysis-of-floc/"&gt;analysis from Mozilla that identifies some problems&lt;/a&gt; in a way that doesn’t completely slam the door on future Firefox adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRFIQF"&gt;Google is pointing to a “rigorous, multi-phased public development process, including extensive discussion and testing periods” for FLoC and other proposals, a fairly obvious signal that it will end up changing or replacing FLoC. “We plan to conclude this origin trial in the coming weeks and incorporate input, before advancing to further ecosystem testing,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdJDuw"&gt;The company is promising a “more detailed schedule” will be posted on its &lt;a href="https://privacysandbox.com/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox website&lt;/a&gt;. But in the meantime, here’s its current schedule — complete with a note that this revised timeline will need to be approved by regulators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sXtUKT"&gt;After this public development process, and subject to our engagement with the CMA, our plan for Chrome is to phase out support for third party cookies in two stages:&lt;br&gt;Stage 1 (Starting late-2022): Once testing is complete and APIs are launched in Chrome, we will announce the start of stage 1. During stage 1, publishers and the advertising industry will have time to migrate their services. We expect this stage to last for nine months, and we will monitor adoption and feedback carefully before moving to stage 2.&lt;br&gt;Stage 2 (Starting mid-2023): Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies over a three month period finishing in late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Series S is available for $10 off at Costco right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xUsQKQ"&gt;Amazon Prime Day is officially behind us, and while many of the event’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/6/23/22546806/prime-day-leftover-deals-apple-headphones-video-games-sale"&gt;best deals still linger&lt;/a&gt;, some retailers are already moving on to bigger—or at least different—things. Take Costco, for example, which is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-s-all-digital-console.product.100784872.html"&gt;members-only deal on the Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; online, dropping the price from $300 to $290. The next-gen console shares many of the same characteristics as the Series X, yet, it has a slimmer build, less storage, and no disc drive. It also has less processing power, though, it’s still compatible with all the same games, as well as most Xbox One titles. It’s a small discount, but the Series S is hard to come by at any price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hu6tV9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ZEBqjL"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KpYFKo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bYplOw"&gt;By all accounts, it’s been a rough six months for the team behind &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. Despite the disastrous launch, however, developer CD Projekt Red has continued to patch the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397638/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-biggest-game-ever-sales"&gt;highly successful&lt;/a&gt; follow-up to &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3, &lt;/em&gt;squashing bugs and addressing fixes that made it impossible to play on last-gen systems. If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543298/cyberpunk-2077-playstation-store-ps4-warning"&gt;Sony’s recent warnings&lt;/a&gt; are any indication, it’s still not there, but PS5 and Xbox Series X owners should have far less trouble playing the ambitious RPG, especially with a free next-gen upgrade coming in the second half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLmsoT"&gt;If you’re a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S owner, you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744281188663338099#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCyberpunk-2077-Warner-Bros-Xbox-One%2F973645137%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227292927973%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D354677390340%26wl4%3Dpla-762963988014%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D973645137%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9T4u5oYdkeHoCx1-6u4gn6kY5X-ds0qAtUltKqPT6lAqstlzqqIZSxoCcQwQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now for $20, the biggest discount we’ve on the title to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The AirPods Pro are the best true wireless headphones if you are fully embedded in Apple’s ecosystem, as they pair seamlessly with Apple devices and switch between them easily. They also include active noise cancelation, something you won’t find on the standard AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo won’t charge extra for its upcoming electric vehicles with lidar sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujKZTqpCcap00L5DmfKADjGiewg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498029/ahawkins_191016_3734_0108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fqr0pN"&gt;Volvo plans on offering the lidar — and artificial intelligence-powered safety features — of its upcoming electric vehicle as standard, but the Swedish automaker plans on charging extra for its semi-autonomous systems, like the hands-free Highway Pilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxe5uF"&gt;Volvo’s fully electric successor to the XC90 SUV, to be revealed in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;will have two new components that have never appeared on a Volvo vehicle before&lt;/a&gt;: a lidar sensor produced by Luminar and an onboard “autonomous driving computer” powered by video game hardware manufacturer Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZC7WlU"&gt;Those two pieces of hardware will help enhance Volvo’s traditional safety features, like automatic emergency braking and blindspot detection, before the company is ready to start rolling out more autonomous features to customers, said Volvo chief technology officer Henrik Green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiMHxu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a new level of safety in all the vehicles”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh1d4g"&gt;“Standardizing the lidar technology and the compute platform will provide our consumers with a new level of safety in all the vehicles that are affected,” Green told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0XY5a"&gt;Offering this new equipment as standard also gives Volvo a leg up on data collection, which will help with the inevitable push toward autonomous vehicles, Green said. “With this system installed on the thousands of vehicles that we will provide to our customers, we can harvest data and accelerate the development of the autonomous drive system,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjQV3j"&gt;At that point, the more highly automated features, like hands free driving on the highway, will come at a cost to customers who wish to update their vehicles. “We see a business opportunity, of course, to have that on subscription or as an upfront payment,” Green said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup61v"&gt;Volvo has said that it will roll out Highway Pilot as part of its next big platform update, the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA2), which will arrive with the next-generation XC90 SUV in 2022. SPA2 will also underpin the automaker’s upcoming electric vehicles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21455850/polestar-precept-electric-car-concept-android-production"&gt;the Polestar 3 SUV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917697/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-ev-photos-hands-on"&gt;the XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A Luminar lidar embedded in the company’s test vehicle. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4scPXi"&gt;Thanks to Luminar’s lidar and Nvidia’s Orin system-on-a-chip, these forthcoming vehicles will have the ability to “see” its surrounding environment and “think” about its next moves with such accuracy that it can “override” the human driver in situations where a collision might have otherwise been inevitable, Green said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLnbz1"&gt;“We know that the probability that we are right is higher than the probability of the human, which means that we can override the human in certain situations where we could see what otherwise [might] lead to a collision or an impact,” he said. Volvo’s current collision avoidance system, Green added, does not have that predictive capability and must exclusively rely on the vehicle owner to drive to the best of their ability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ueeFfm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Luminar is using lidar to help build the ‘uncrashable car’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533711/luminar-lidar-autonomous-vehicle-hands-on-demo-austin-russell"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pD9mwx"&gt;Volvo is one of the few automakers to include lidar in its future production vehicles. The laser sensor used to be very expensive, with one company selling units for $75,000 each, but that price has come down over the years. Luminar, the Florida-based company that is supplying Volvo’s lidar, has said it hopes to price its sensors at $1,000 per unit, with the goal of getting that number down to $500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1XRj"&gt;Austin Russell, CEO of Luminar, said that Volvo’s decision to sell its vehicles with his company’s sensors as standard speaks to the importance of safety to the Swedish automaker. “When it comes to fundamental safety, the question is should it really be optional?” Russell said. “There’s no airbag upgrade package or seatbelt upgrade package.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IztVzP"&gt;Russell said Volvo’s decision to include lidar in passenger vehicles will give it an advantage as the auto industry continues its slow progression to automated driving. “A lot of the other automakers really went all in on the robotaxi side of the game, almost ignoring the core passenger vehicle business,” Russell said. “That’s actually a real opportunity to see this happen and see this through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctnOk2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is surprisingly solid on the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68MyXpJJOBajG5B8zvPN7zZJHfU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497997/THPS_Switch_9_THawk.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Ry0Kl"&gt;We’re more than four years into the life of the Nintendo Switch, and yet in some ways the handheld device remains an enigma. Namely: when there’s a port of a big game, you never quite know what to expect. Sometimes you get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22169262/doom-eternal-switch-review"&gt;a welcome surprise like &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, other times a mess like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Which why I was only cautiously excited about &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4"&gt;an excellent-yet-awkwardly named remaster of the first two games in the series&lt;/a&gt; — making its way to the Switch. This is a game where movement and flow is paramount; if frame rate hitches get in the way of a good run, it’s not really worth playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meXhgc"&gt;Thankfully, from what I’ve played, &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; is a surprisingly solid port. It’s not the ideal way to play, but it definitely works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMoSoi"&gt;First, the obvious: the game doesn’t look great. This is especially true if you’re coming off of the recent next-gen updates for the game, which made an already excellent-looking skating title look even better. On the Switch, meanwhile, the game has a flat, simple look, particularly when it comes to the textures, which can be blurry or muddled. On next-gen consoles the skaters look incredibly close to their real-world counterparts; on the Switch they’re more like PS3 characters. It doesn’t look bad, necessarily, but definitely dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5tVygP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9355637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1WKI4"&gt;This is actually good news. If the developers had focused on the visuals, the performance would almost certainly suffer. It’s a tradeoff that has to be made with these ports, and the team at developer Vicarious Visions has made the right choice. I’d much rather a bland-looking &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; game that plays well than the opposite. And that’s exactly what the Switch version is. During the few hours I spent with it, I didn’t experience any significant slowdown or frame rate drops. Obviously it’s not a technical showcase — it runs at a solid 30fps — but I was shocked at just how well the game ran.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DstSF5qvMQkngeylTuuK5XOCvVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677660/THPS_Switch_7_TJones.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fgqyp3"&gt;As always, whether that tradeoff is worth it really depends on your personal preference. Technical showpieces are great, but so is being able to play something as slick as &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; wherever you want. (The franchise actually has a checkered history on portable devices, with a handful of excellent isometric &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; titles on the Game Boy Advance that are now lost to time.) Combine the Switch’s portability with the brilliant &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack and a good pair of headphones, and you have a very zen experience. Which is exactly what you need to hit some of those high scores. Really, the only thing that interrupted my flow was drifting Joy-Con controllers, which I can’t blame on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWpAxx"&gt;It’s safe to put &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; in the “good” column of Switch ports. Visually it’s a noticeable downgrade, but that’s to be expected. If you want the most technically capable version of this remaster, you certainly won’t find it here. But that’s fine: the whole point is being able to play a slick, modern version of these games on the go. And in that, at least, the Switch version of &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmKVzn"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches on the Switch on June 25th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Microsoft’s Windows 11 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wbc7b8rA19wjKXtXlEG_i11B8U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497805/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCm3vF"&gt;Microsoft is hosting a special Windows event later today where we’re expecting the company to unveil Windows 11. Microsoft has been teasing a “next generation” of Windows for months, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;leaked copy of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; suggests we’re going to see a number of changes during Microsoft’s event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDu2FZ"&gt;Microsoft is expected to focus on new UI improvements to Windows, including a new Start menu, rounded corners, and more simplifications to using Windows 11. We’re also expecting to hear more about a new Windows store that will offer better access to apps, and some multitasking and gaming improvements to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gOLRnC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 11 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543253/microsoft-windows-11-event-date-time-what-to-expect-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Mk2DaD"&gt;The event should run for around 45 minutes, which gives Microsoft enough time to talk through the important aspects of Windows 11 ahead of a deep dive for developers later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lu9iPJ"&gt;WHEN DOES THE WINDOWS 11 EVENT START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHGpB"&gt;It starts at 11AM ET / 8AM PT / 4PM BST. Following the event, a special developer session will also be available to watch online at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE WINDOWS 11 EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j0z316"&gt;We’ll embed the event livestream up top once it’s available. Otherwise, head to these links below for more:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beeple and the founder of Pitchfork are launching an NFT site where you can buy moments in time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A box containing a digital display, which shows an image of Andy Murray kissing a trophy after winning Wimbledon in 2013." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xNMonweQnR03-w_3DlUiXBbTTA=/0x114:2732x1935/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497818/WENEW_Physical_Artifact_On_Display_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some sales include a digital display showcasing the moment being purchased.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wenew&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z8dBgH"&gt;After selling an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March, Beeple is making his next big move in the digital art space: he’s launching an NFT platform that’ll sell “iconic” moments in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqWeV"&gt;The platform, called &lt;a href="https://we.new/"&gt;Wenew&lt;/a&gt;, is co-founded by Beeple and some longtime collaborators. They’re also bringing on Ryan Schreiber, the founder of &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;, as Wenew’s editor-in-chief. Schreiber will help curate the moments sold on the platform, which will include highlights from the careers of athletes and artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gJyxP"&gt;“We’re definitely looking at this as sort of immortalizing these moments of human achievement for collectors,” Schreiber told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The same display and box as above but presented on a shelf." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_IUcPoGKPG0rr29dX1ocJTVjSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22676612/WENEW_Physical_Artifact_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wenew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wenew calls the digital displays “physical artifacts.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ufzu1T"&gt;Wenew’s first NFT series catalogs Andy Murray’s journey to winning Wimbledon in 2013. You’ll be able to buy his emotional runner-up speech from 2012, some of Murray’s best shots from 2013, and his eventual victory speech, among others. Or to be more specific, you’ll be able to buy a limited-edition digital file &lt;em&gt;representing &lt;/em&gt;those moments since that’s all an NFT really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHimeQ"&gt;The NFTs will be priced from $49 to $4,999 each, and some of the more expensive ones will come with actual memorabilia — a signed poster, tickets to Wimbledon 2022, a replica trophy, or a digital display. At the very high end, Wenew will be auctioning off an NFT commemorating Murray’s game-winning point, and the buyer will also get 30 minutes to play tennis with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcS1yi"&gt;“A lot of things in the NFT world feel like a cash grab right now, and we wanted to put storytelling first,” Michael Figge, a Wenew co-founder, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivhe5t"&gt;NFTs face a few perpetual questions — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;starting with, simply, “why?”&lt;/a&gt; — but Wenew at least tries to answer the question of “what are you actually buying?” The initial buyers get something real out of the purchase, in addition to the nominal bragging rights that typically accompany an NFT purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oRn58"&gt;The format is similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA’s Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; platform, which turns game highlights into virtual trading cards (albeit without any IRL extras). They’ve been a huge success for the NBA so far, with more than $500 million in sales in just its first six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KG1OwQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The potential to actually be able to make what they deserve to make”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPebZu"&gt;Wenew wants to expand on that idea by reaching back in time and across different disciplines. The company plans to move into the music space, too, which is part of why Schreiber is on board. His job is to find major athletes and artists and build story arcs around them, identifying where NFTs can be sold along the way. The NFT sales will be accompanied by feature-length stories from journalists meant to explore why these events mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UUYdS"&gt;There’s also the outstanding question of how many musicians Wenew can get on board. NFTs have been controversial in music spaces — “I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse,” Zola Jesus &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month — and broadly criticized by artists for their energy use and climate impact. Schreiber sees them as a way to “redefine” the relationship between artists and their benefactors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEbi4O"&gt;“It offers them the potential to actually be able to make what they deserve to make, frankly, off of their work,” Schreiber said. Figge said the platform will include a carbon offset fee that “more than offsets that NFT’s transaction costs to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL0U6U"&gt;Wenew’s website launches today, and its first NFT sales begin on July 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
