    <title>Facebook bans academics who researched ad transparency and misinformation on Facebook </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vFppd"&gt;Facebook has banned the personal accounts of academics who researched ad transparency and the spread of misinformation on the social network. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/"&gt;Facebook says&lt;/a&gt; the group violated its term of service by scraping user data without permission. But the academics say they are being silenced for exposing problems on Facebook’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHuBqD"&gt;The researchers were part of &lt;a href="https://adobservatory.org/"&gt;NYU Ad Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, a project created to examine the origin and spread of political ads on Facebook. As the group explained in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/the-political-ads-facebook-wont-show-you-e0d6181bca25"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; in May, their aim is to uncover who pays for political ads and how they are being targeted. Such work has important implications for understanding the spread of disinformation on Facebook, as the company does not fact-check political ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6vrkY"&gt;To help their work, the researchers created a browser plug-in called &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;Ad Observer&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically collects data on what political ads users are being shown and why those ads are being targeted to them. As per its &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, the plug-in does not collect any personally-identifying information, including users’ name, Facebook ID number, or friend list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0A0443"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NYU’s research offered new insights into Facebook’s problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIGFbo"&gt;Data collected by Ad Observer is then made publicly available to researchers and journalists who use the information to reveal trends and problems on Facebook’s platform. Stories directly resulting from this work include Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-biden-election-ads"&gt;failure to disclose who pays for some political ads&lt;/a&gt;, and how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313013/far-right-news-misinformation-facebook-us-2020-election-nyu-study-engagement"&gt;far-right misinformation is more engaging than misinformation from center or left sources.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkH3Ln"&gt;Facebook offers &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of this information voluntarily through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library"&gt;Ad Library&lt;/a&gt;, but not all. For example, it doesn’t share data about how ads are targeted based on users’ interests. People can find this for themselves by clicking on ads they’re shown, and it’s this data that was collected by the NYU. (Facebook does provide information on ad targeting through a &lt;a href="https://fort.fb.com/researcher-datasets"&gt;special research program called FORT&lt;/a&gt;, but this is controlled and filtered by Facebook itself.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKKL1o"&gt;Laura Edelson, an NYU researcher involved in the project, and whose personal account was banned by Facebook, says the company wants to end independent scrutiny of its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3kJnHF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work. Facebook has also effectively cut off access to more than two dozen other researchers and journalists who get access to Facebook data through our project, 3/4&lt;/p&gt;— Laura Edelson (@LauraEdelson2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LauraEdelson2/status/1422736708433481730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GitcL"&gt;“Facebook is silencing us because our work often calls attention to problems on its platform,” Edelson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/facebook-disables-accounts-tied-to-nyu-research-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an emailed statement. “Worst of all, Facebook is using user privacy, a core belief that we have always put first in our work, as a pretext for doing this. If this episode demonstrates anything it is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKhz22"&gt;Facebook says it banned the researchers because they violated the social network’s terms of service, and that the Ad Observer plug-in “collected data about Facebook users who did not install or consent to the collection.” Facebook’s wording suggests the researchers were collecting data about private individuals without consent but, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/nyu-facebook-researchers-scraping"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; in March&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook is actually referring to “advertisers’ accounts, including the names and profile pictures of public Pages that run political ads and the contents of those ads.” (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Facebook to confirm this but the company declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKC9X"&gt;Facebook certainly has good reason to be wary of third-parties collecting data from its site. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt; was only made possible because the company did not exercise proper oversight over how information could be scraped from its platform. It resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion"&gt;$5 billion fine for the company&lt;/a&gt; and new privacy checks by the FTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOWLL6"&gt;Facebook now says it’s required to ban the NYC researchers under these FTC guidelines, as well as disabling their associated Pages and platform access. However, some privacy experts disagree with this. Jonathan Mayer, a professor at Princeton University who researches technology and law, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanmayer/status/1422733522016641028"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that “Facebook’s legal argument is bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3a8WQd"&gt;Facebook says it repeatedly offered to work with the NYU researchers by providing the data they need directly, and first warned the group they &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/24/tech/facebook-nyu-political-ad-data/index.html"&gt;might be banned from the site last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 worked fine with the slowest compatible SSD we could find</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YwHqYsnb0TPi6LXwXx2bvXuK8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676444/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGpAhB"&gt;If your PS5 is already running out of speedy solid state storage, there’s a fix on the way. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;new beta update for the PS5&lt;/a&gt; allows you to expand your paltry 667GB of usable space by popping in the same sort of M.2 SSD stick you might slip into your laptop or desktop PC. My colleague Mitchell has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22366087"&gt;a PS5 SSD buying guide right here&lt;/a&gt; that meets all of Sony’s recommendations, such as speeds of at least 5,500MB/s. That might leave you wondering, though: what about slower SSDs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJUnow"&gt;That’s why we tracked down an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/XPG-S50-Lite-Internal-AGAMMIXS50L-1T-C/dp/B08HVZWGPP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADATA XPG Gammix S50 Lite&lt;/a&gt;, one of the slowest compatible PCIe Gen4 drives we could find at 3,900MB/s reads and 3,200MB/s writes, and stuck it into a PS5, along with another drive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The PS5 reads 3898.001 megabytes per second in its speed test" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_5tGJnWAryRays4zRc7ziYw5go=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759876/IMG_1307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yep, that’s a 3900MB/s drive all right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v7uWpg"&gt;We compared the S50 Lite against both the PS5’s internal SSD and a 5,000MB/s Sabrent Rocket 500GB in a battery of tests, including load times for games like early PS5 showcases &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales.&lt;/em&gt; We also measured how long it takes to back up games to each kind of drive, throwing in a Seagate external HDD for comparison, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381494/sony-ps5-april-update-games-external-usb-storage-social-features"&gt;Sony now allows you to archive PS5 games and play PS4 games&lt;/a&gt; from an traditional hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE5QEx"&gt;The verdict? Surprisingly, even the slowest compatible SSD we could find had near-identical load times to the one Sony includes in the box. Sometimes it’s a second slower, sometimes a second or two faster, but basically it’s a total wash. Hopping through dimensions in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, I saw no appreciable difference with the slowest SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qHZe23"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10684101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zea66Q"&gt;I also didn’t necessarily see a huge difference between the drives when it comes to transferring games back and forth, but there was one big surprise: at least in this beta, it appears that Sony may be throttling the write speed of the PS5’s own internal drive. It took only 2:26 to send &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;both PS5 and PS4 copies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; to the Sabrent SSD, for instance, but 12:47 to go back to the PS5 — over five times longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59Q8qI"&gt;On average, I saw write speeds of around 1,100MB/s transferring my five test games to either of my add-in M.2 drives, but just around 220MB/s sending those same games back to the PS5. Both of those are far better than the 141MB/s average transfer speeds I saw sending games to the Seagate HDD and the 97MB/s I saw beaming them back — it took over half an hour (31:24) to transfer the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games’ 176.5GB back to the internal SSD. But the slower internal SSD write speeds are weird, and Sony didn’t have a comment when I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSk2nn"&gt;For now, the bigger question is this: will game developers fully optimize their games for the incredible speeds an SSD can afford? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D718aM"&gt;For instance, take a look at our load times for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; in the chart above. Regardless of drive, the PS4 version takes over four times longer to load! It’s the difference between waiting through a loading screen filled with gameplay tips to keep you occupied, and — at 10 seconds flat from the time you leave the PS5’s home screen to the time you can move Cloud Strife in your save game — barely seeing a loading screen at all. The latter is incredible to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YlIBe4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WZ3pTe61O4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kOH5dC"&gt;Also, see those &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales &lt;/em&gt;numbers? The game doesn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; load as quickly as it could. Sometimes, you’ll boot up the game to see Marvel, Insomniac, and PlayStation Studios intros that eat up a whole 26 seconds, making the game take more like 43 seconds to load in total. But other times, it’ll mysteriously bypass those, loading in more like 17 seconds, and I couldn’t figure out why. I’d love to have a toggle to turn off those intros, and here’s hoping more PS5 games skip them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4F4sa4"&gt;Would I run out and buy the slowest PCIe Gen4 SSD I can buy for my PS5? I’m not so sure, because Sony picked its recommended SSD spec for a reason — even if today’s games and today’s PS5 aren’t taking full advantage, developers may need that additional headroom in the future. They’ve been promised 5,500MB/s to deliver instant game worlds, and I’d hate to find out I bought the wrong drive years down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5sHxD"&gt;Plus, there might already be some moments in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;where you’ll notice a difference, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371"&gt;says Insomniac technical director Mike Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXpgVe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried some below-spec Gen4 M.2 drives as well and saw up to 15% slower loading in the most SSD-stressing areas of the game. Not too shabby, but keep a close eye on technical specs if you’re making an SSD purchase, as our game does rely on high-quality storage.  &lt;/p&gt;— Mike Fitzgerald (@fitzymj) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj3Wyt"&gt;Then again, Microsoft also uses an SSD in its Xbox Series X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185141/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-comparison-specs-features-release-date"&gt;but one with sustained raw performance at 2.4GB/s&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the PS5’s listed 5.5GB/s read speeds. So even if developers do take advantage, it’s possible many next-gen games never see the full benefit if they’re targeting both Xbox and PlayStation instead of PS5 specifically. You’ll likely see the most benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;Sony’s exclusive PlayStation Studios titles,&lt;/a&gt; though Square Enix’s speedy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; load times gives me hope for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm1LS1"&gt;Either way, for a list of SSDs that actually meet Sony’s requirements and recommendations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-m2-ssd-options-buying-guide-which-drives-compatible-playstation-5"&gt;here’s our buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmGd7q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, August 4th 7:25AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated to note Xbox Series X sustained SSD performance data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft pauses free Windows 365 cloud PC trials after ‘significant demand’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6amEz0ns5GNDRsmZtNhPCCX1AOY=/0x200:4800x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676386/windows365ui.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ux8WbJ"&gt;Microsoft launched its new cloud PC Windows 365 service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605800/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-streaming-html5"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has already had to pause free trials due to demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575064/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-launch-date-price-features"&gt;Windows 365 lets you rent a cloud PC&lt;/a&gt; — with a variety of CPU, RAM, and storage options — and then stream Windows 10 or Windows 11 via a web browser. The service reached max capacity after only a day of signups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5UwrX"&gt;“Following significant demand, we have reached capacity for Windows 365 trials,” reads a statement from the Microsoft 365 Twitter account. “We have seen unbelievable response to Windows 365 and need to pause our free trial program while we provision additional capacity,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RDS4U/status/1422616706485080065"&gt;explains Scott Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, director of Windows 365 program management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D98Md45TfMYubBLAPoFCerUGy-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716693/windows365web.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 running in a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0xp0a"&gt;Windows 365 is only available to businesses right now, and there’s clearly been more demand than Microsoft had anticipated if the company has hit capacity issues after just a day of free trials. Microsoft launched the service on Monday, with per-user pricing that starts at $20 per month for one vCPU, 2GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and 12GB of bandwidth if you already have a Windows 10 license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxfiUk"&gt;There are a variety of configurations for Windows 365, including one at the top end that includes eight vCPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $158 per month. All of the different price options are available at &lt;a href="http://windows365.com/"&gt;Windows365.com&lt;/a&gt;, but you’ll now need to &lt;a href="https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-signup-for-updates-windows-from-the-cloud.html?LCID=EN-US"&gt;register interest&lt;/a&gt; in a free trial as Microsoft has hit capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces ‘next-generation’ under-display selfie camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVtbzeVdgX-gEZ2Tc2W38f8KvLQ=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675770/OPPO_USC_2021_Prototype___3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQYZtA"&gt;Oppo has announced the latest iteration of its under-screen camera technology, claiming it allows for a selfie camera to be placed under the display “without compromising the integrity of the screen.” Unlike earlier approaches that reduce pixel density in the portion of the screen that covers the camera in order to let more light pass through, Oppo is using smaller pixels to maintain the same 400-ppi sharpness as the rest of the OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvQ0np"&gt;The result, according to Oppo, is that users should notice “almost no visual difference between the [under-screen camera] area and the rest of the screen during everyday use, creating a much more immersive visual experience.” The company has shown off an image of a prototype phone running an e-reader app, which would be pretty much the worst-case scenario for earlier under-display cameras due to the white background and sharp text. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3TP02N5rcWGkY2IS1v7OHz6xBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760057/OPPO_USC_E_book_Reading.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EEx8tP"&gt;As for the quality of the camera itself, here’s a sample image provided by Oppo:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQ05q6C4pZWPQry7cZnrc1p2Hng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760056/OPPO_USC_Selfie_Sample_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ8tbD"&gt;It’s only one sample in good light, and there do seem to be some color artifacts in certain portions of the image. It does, however, look considerably better than what you’d get from the first under-display camera to hit the market, which was on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 5G&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sx6BV"&gt;That said, ZTE has one up on Oppo by actually shipping a phone already, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597594/zte-axon-30-refresh-specs-availability-under-display-phone-camera"&gt;its latest Axon 30&lt;/a&gt; is meant to have improved the tech as well. ZTE is claiming the same 400-ppi density in the camera portion of the screen, plus better camera quality than the Axon 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awZY8O"&gt;Oppo has been working on under-display cameras for a long time, showing off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;world’s first demo at MWC Shanghai in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but at some point it’s going to have to put one in an actual commercial device. For now, it’s hard to say too much about the tech improvements without even seeing a prototype for ourselves in person. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Street Fighter’s Guile and Cammy are coming to Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lacPkHsJF85JdzkkDTaYJZTfbLo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675236/E75lsESXoAcTOFj.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Street Fighter’s&lt;em&gt; Cammy and Guile in Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldG1lO"&gt;Epic Games is adding two more &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt; icons to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite. &lt;/em&gt;Playable Chun-Li and Ryu skins were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;added to the game in February&lt;/a&gt;, but soon, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/round-2-street-fighter-s-cammy-and-guile-soldier-on-in-fortnite"&gt;Guile and Cammy skins&lt;/a&gt; will make their debut in the game’s item shop. You’ll be able to buy them starting August 7th at 8PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWYMuv"&gt;I think both skins look great — I’m personally a huge fan of Guile’s ridiculous-looking flat top hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gs0shb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Round 2. FIGHT  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Announcing two new challengers! Guile and Cammy from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StreetFighter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StreetFighter&lt;/a&gt; are making their way to the Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read about their upcoming Cosmetic Sets and about the Cammy Cup where you can win her Outfit early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; : &lt;a href="https://t.co/ASHildQt70"&gt;https://t.co/ASHildQt70&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Uc1nizbn9V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Uc1nizbn9V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1422686370770952199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xcyT31"&gt;Each skin will have two different variants, which you can see below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-9MibduAkhCF3h8mdQE-eP3PzdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759746/17br_cammy_guile_newsimage_guile_1920x1080_d57b7a2c86f7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Guile’s cosmetics in &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhV8d5IZ3nuVU_FLOg6iL08P8-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759747/17br_cammy_guile_newsimage_cammy_1920x1080_bf9e74b28a4d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here are Cammy’s cosmetics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SaotJ9"&gt;And if you want a chance of getting to play as Cammy early, you can compete in the Cammy Cup on August 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyFw0Z"&gt;The skins arrive at a busy time for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — Tuesday evening, Epic added a skin based on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1422708867079737354"&gt;DC Comics character Bloodsport&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the release of &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;. And in-game, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595880/fortnite-alien-event-date-chapter-2-season-7"&gt;countdown clock&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22602826/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-concert-epic-games"&gt;Ariana Grande’s upcoming concert series&lt;/a&gt;, which kicks off on August 6th at 6PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJubgY"&gt;Tuesday morning, dataminers found audio in the game for an unreleased emote featuring rapper DaBaby, who has come under scrutiny for making homophobic comments last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607978/fortnite-dababy-emote-migos-am-to-pm-audio-epic-games-update"&gt;but Epic declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when asked about the audio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches big redesign of its online store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20J14Q9P0R479D-KsWROhlWP1jQ=/0x81:2900x2014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675186/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.50.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Apple Store layout.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d9NObp"&gt;The Apple Store was mysteriously down on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IsTheStoreDown/status/1422705926197415943"&gt;for just about an hour&lt;/a&gt;, but it has emerged from the downtime &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fstore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608636%2Fapple-online-store-redesign-2021-launch-cards" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a brand new look&lt;/a&gt; and a dedicated tab on Apple’s top-level navigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsn2cz"&gt;At the top of the store, there are images and links to many of Apple’s product lines (Mac, iPhone, AirPods, etc.). Some of those links take you to new dedicated Store pages for the products, which show you what models are available and point to resources like shopping guides, accessories, and support. On the main Store page, there are also sections for what’s new, links to support pages, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tt3NiO9CY8QHomP3rx52Am__YA0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759778/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_5.02.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad category in the new Apple Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sZ0X8K"&gt;The new design is filled with cards — it’s somewhat reminiscent of Apple’s Store app for iOS. It feels mobile-first, with smooth horizontal scrolling between cards on phone, something that doesn’t translate as well to desktop. There, the site surfaces arrows you may need to tap on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2f8KGKLy7b04ew2kx6YK8tVuxRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759820/RPReplay_Final1628036839_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new online store on my colleague’s iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hDOSt3"&gt;As far as we can tell, there aren’t any new products — this update appears to be strictly a fresh coat of paint for Apple’s online store. And the pages for actually buying a product don’t appear to be different than they were before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGoWOf"&gt;The change to the store arrives ahead of what’s expected to be a busy fall for Apple — the company has been rumored to be working on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; that all could launch soon. Whatever products Apple ends up announcing, now there’s a new store that can showcase them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile confirms it will shut down Sprint’s LTE network next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="t-mobile and sprint logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s3IN2gvmTmq1MfpeKh-YCszm0W4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675116/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile has wasted no time consolidating Sprint’s network and spectrum with its own.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nZkG92"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/t-mobile-to-shutter-sprints-lte-network-on-june-30-2022/d/d-id/771269"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; T-Mobile has committed to a June 30, 2022 shutdown date for Sprint’s LTE network. It’s an expected move as T-Mobile continues to absorb Sprint’s network and customers into its own base, and comes six months after its contentious planned January 1, 2022 shutdown of Sprint’s 3G CDMA network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mckReg"&gt;A third of Sprint customers have already been moved onto the T-Mobile network, &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Raises-2021-Guidance-Across-the-Board-Again-and-Delivers-Record-Financial-Results-in-Q2/default.aspx"&gt;according to T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;. The company expects to be able to migrate the remaining two thirds by that mid-2022 deadline, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/t-mobile-running-fast-to-achieve-benefits-merger"&gt;according to CFO Peter Osvaldik’s remarks&lt;/a&gt; at an investor conference last month. Some of those customers will likely need new devices that are compatible with T-Mobile LTE and VoLTE, though the company has had no shortage of enticing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Ft-mobile-revvl-v-plus-5g%3Ficid%3DMGPO_TMO_P_21REVVLOUS_1U0R1MHTP3PF5UOM25482&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608265%2Ft-mobile-sprint-lte-network-shutdown-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5G phone offers lately&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Ft-mobile-network-evolution&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608265%2Ft-mobile-sprint-lte-network-shutdown-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says it will reach out to all customers&lt;/a&gt; who will need a new SIM card or device to stay connected, but if you’re curious whether your device is compatible you can run an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Ft-mobile-network%23tech&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608265%2Ft-mobile-sprint-lte-network-shutdown-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IMEI check on T-Mobile’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ujfewh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile hasn’t been shy about moving quickly to consolidate Sprint’s network assets with its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Vud9n"&gt;The Sprint LTE network shutdown doesn’t come as a shock — by Sprint’s own admission the network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17914230/sprint-lte-network-coverage-bad-tmobile-merger"&gt;wasn’t very good to begin with&lt;/a&gt;, and T-Mobile hasn’t been shy about moving quickly to consolidate Sprint’s network assets with its own. The company’s 3G shutdown timeline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;has been the source of a lot of bad blood&lt;/a&gt; between T-Mobile and Dish Network, which acquired Sprint’s former prepaid business Boost Mobile as part of the merger deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2AlnAM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"},{"title":"Predictably, T-Mobile’s merger promises weren’t enough to make a carrier out of Dish","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MckEQj"&gt;The relationship has soured to the point of Dish announcing that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;take the majority of its MVNO business to AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; — which T-Mobile followed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;a promotional offer directed at Boost customers&lt;/a&gt;. Boost had no additional comments to share about the potential impacts of the LTE shutdown on its customers when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T has officially spun off DirecTV, which is now its own business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DirecTV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6HMv6H9Q7flUIXx9KDC-Cs6e7Q=/0x0:6390x4260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675098/1174204846.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GXVhLG"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T announced earlier this year that it would spin its video properties DirecTV, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and U-verse into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301840/att-tpg-directv-tv-uverse-new-company-announced"&gt;new company&lt;/a&gt; it would co-manage with private equity firm TPG Capital. That transaction is finally complete, and the services will now operate as a single company under the name DirecTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1XhQt"&gt;As outlined earlier this year when the company initially announced plans to off-load its struggling DirecTV business, AT&amp;amp;T will retain a 70 percent stake in the company, while TPG will take a 30 percent stake. The telecom giant said the deal for which it received $7.1 billion in cash would help pay off its &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/business/ATT-WarnerMedia-Discovery.html"&gt;massive debt&lt;/a&gt;, with the company projecting it can put a stop to the bleeding by the end of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlKQvY"&gt;Part of that debt is owed because of AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/18/5727276/att-acquires-directv"&gt;acquisition of the original DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, at which time AT&amp;amp;T paid $48.5 billion ($67 billion accounting for debt) to acquire the business. To say that that business decision has failed to deliver is putting it mildly, as DirecTV &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/12/att-reportedly-struggling-to-sell-directv-at-anything-but-a-huge-loss/"&gt;bled customers for years&lt;/a&gt; prior to the TPG deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywKqR9"&gt;At the time the TPG deal was announced in February, AT&amp;amp;T boss John Stankey said that the company planned to focus specifically on “connectivity and content,” including 5G wireless and fiber as well as its service HBO Max. More recently, however, AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451111/att-ceo-stankey-unleash-assets-warnermedia-discovery-hbo"&gt;revised strategy&lt;/a&gt; is to focus on its core business and as Stankey put it recently, “unleash the media assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDePtL"&gt;The deal with TPG does not include any of WarnerMedia’s various assets, including its marquee streaming service HBO Max, because those are being offloaded to Discovery instead. (WarnerMedia and Discovery are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;awaiting approval&lt;/a&gt; for the merger of their two companies.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1Ol8Z"&gt;But the deal &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/video.html"&gt;will include&lt;/a&gt; existing DirecTV content deals for things like NFL Sunday Ticket. AT&amp;amp;T added that DirecTV would “continue to offer HBO Max to subscribers along with any bundled wireless or broadband services and associated customer discounts.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Starlink app gets big update to help find clear sky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vRlMfyrfY4JWFaP9CJkXn-FvdpY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675005/_MG_5016.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joey Roulette / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cD7cIf"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink mobile app got a refreshing upgrade this week that makes it easier to find clear patches of sky and monitor connection outages — and adds a new dark mode for its user interface. The app improvements came out yesterday as SpaceX reported 90,000 active users in its open “better than nothing” beta phase, which spans rural regions across 12 different countries so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jsfVj"&gt;The “completely updated and renovated” version, as SpaceX describes in its Apple’s App Store changelog, includes a new way to scan your surroundings for obstructions before installing a Starlink terminal. Like its previous method, the app directs users to scan their surroundings using their phone cameras, but the new version generates a tiny dome around your Starlink dish that overlays potential obstructions, marked by different colors. Reddit users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/owk3t8/new_starlink_app_out_big_changes/"&gt;seemed impressed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Aim0Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Big Starlink app update has a fancy 3D obstruction checker that’s way more informative and helpful. The most important Starlink accessory is still a chainsaw, though &lt;a href="https://t.co/Rmd75Iy1jk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Rmd75Iy1jk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nilay patel (@reckless) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1422683409843957762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pDZkvx"&gt;The new update also allows users to track how frequently Starlink service drops with a new outage log &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/rW7mNaX"&gt;that visualizes data&lt;/a&gt; on usage, latency and uptime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fd5jGY"&gt;SpaceX has launched 1,740 Starlink satellites since 2019, positioning itself as the world’s largest satellite operator with roughly 1,650 currently in orbit (after some were de-orbited). The company &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/108023048910723/SpaceX%20WTB-IB%2012%20GHz%20Ex%20Parte%20(08-02-2021).pdf"&gt;told the Federal Communications Commission (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that Starlink has roughly 90,000 active users, which includes both individual households and various government users like schools, towns, and fire departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="829AjS"&gt;The potential for Starlink, a massive internet-from-space service, to upend the market for grounded broadband fiber might be tantalizing, but the company has a ways to go, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;as we noted in our review in May&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX has updated its Starlink app a few times since then, with Monday’s update being the biggest so far.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google leaks unannounced Nest security cameras on its own online store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jiD8-AyFMOs2ped32CjaGgqskOA=/0x27:1346x924/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674964/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_3.27.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from Google’s online store that shows off a new Nest Cam and Nest Doorbell.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ciVIET"&gt;Google has apparently leaked some unannounced Nest security cameras &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/connected_home?hl=en-US"&gt;right on its own online store&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;thanks for the tip, Eric!&lt;/em&gt;). Google confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216568/new-google-nest-cam-lineup-confirmed-outdoor-iq-discontinued"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would be releasing a new lineup of security cameras this year, and it seems like the company’s store may have just revealed what’s on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9oKgT"&gt;As far as we can tell, the new devices include a combined outdoor / indoor battery-powered Nest Cam, a Nest Cam with floodlight, an indoor wired Nest Cam, and a battery-powered Nest Doorbell. When we tried to click on the “Learn More” and “Buy” links for those devices, the site sent us back to the main Google Store homepage, so it seems that they might be live earlier than they are supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gStgohkG5CcG4Mi8w_AGz2_raFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759655/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_3.47.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The only links that worked correctly on this page were the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam?hl=en-US" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nest Cam Indoor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam_outdoor?hl=en-US" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nest Cam Outdoor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. All the others sent us back to the Google Store homepage.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-vodHWz1bbh0QgLyBY0AcHuttbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759658/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_3.48.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The links that worked in this section were the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_hello_doorbell?hl=en-US" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;wired Nest Doorbell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/front_door_package?hl=en-US" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front Door Monitoring Package&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” but the one for the package led to a different package featuring the wired Nest Doorbell instead of the battery-powered one.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KqvalX"&gt;The new additions, if they are released, would fill in some big gaps in Google’s security camera lineup. Amazon-owned Ring helped popularize the concept of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/9/16112752/ring-video-doorbell-2-security-camera-review"&gt;a video doorbell with a battery&lt;/a&gt;, which can be placed in a lot more places than a camera that requires a constant connection to power. (Right now, Google &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9250901?hl=en#zippy=%2Cdont-use-an-external-battery-pack"&gt;explicitly recommends&lt;/a&gt; against using external batteries with its connected security cameras.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADa2Bd"&gt;Ring also developed one of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Floodlight-Camera-Motion-Activated-Security/dp/B0722R3WV5?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=4&amp;amp;imprToken=febd872e-fd39-7df6-c15&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22135056%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early popular connected floodlight cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371015/ring-floodlight-cam-wired-pro-video-doorbell-4-price-features"&gt;recently released a new floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-AK-T84201W1-floodlight-Camera/dp/B07H25G6FN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21048999/arlo-pro-3-floodlight-security-camera-ces-2020"&gt;Arlo&lt;/a&gt;, and other vendors make them, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPKWWR"&gt;Google didn’t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQzcI3"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Google has leaked a smart home product — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18285721/google-nest-hub-max-smart-display-10-inch-screen-built-in-camera-leak"&gt;it accidentally revealed the Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18301161/google-nest-hub-max-camera-home-announcement-io-2019-keynote"&gt;weeks before it was announced&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that these new security camera listings have already appeared on the online store could indicate that an announcement is imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HThOUp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you can share any details about these Nest products, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/tip-us-secure-contact-email"&gt;&lt;em&gt;send us a tip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
