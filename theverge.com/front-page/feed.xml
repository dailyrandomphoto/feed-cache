    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Blue Origin is backed by the world’s richest man — why didn’t it just offer NASA a cheaper lunar lander?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xRFYvC"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin “gambled” with its Moon lander proposal last year by hoping NASA would be willing to negotiate its $5.9 billion price tag, agency attorneys argued in blunt legal filings obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;NASA, cash-strapped with a tight budget from Congress, declined to negotiate and turned down Blue Origin’s lunar lander in April and picked SpaceX’s instead, sparking ongoing protests from Bezos’ space company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwy3T9"&gt;NASA officials haven’t talked much about Blue Origin’s legal quarrels beyond occasional acknowledgements that the company’s protesting — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;first at a watchdog agency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;now in federal court&lt;/a&gt; — is holding up the agency’s effort to land humans on the Moon by 2024. But in hundreds of pages of legal filings &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request, agency attorneys exhaustively laid out NASA’s defense of its Artemis Moon program&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and doubled down on its decision to pick one company, SpaceX, for the first crewed mission to the lunar surface since 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vlGuEC"&gt;Round 1: A Costly Bid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="f7StwS"&gt;In NASA’s main response to Blue Origin’s protest,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;filed in late May, senior agency attorneys accused the company of employing a sort of &lt;a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/door-in-the-face-technique"&gt;door-in-the-face&lt;/a&gt; bidding tactic with its $5.9 billion proposal for Blue Moon, the lunar lander Blue Origin is building with a “National Team” that includes Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Blue Origin was “able and willing” to offer NASA a lower price for its lunar lander but chose not to because it expected NASA to ask and negotiate for a lower price first, the attorneys allege, citing a six-page declaration written by the company’s senior vice president Brent Sherwood in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AolJ6H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a well-funded private space company backed by Jeff Bezos”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wsMDJ1"&gt;In the declaration, Sherwood complains that NASA “did not afford Blue Origin, a well-funded private space company backed by Jeff Bezos, any opportunity to submit a revised business position” when NASA found out it wouldn’t have enough money from Congress to fund two lander proposals. He said Blue Origin had already committed “almost one billion dollars” of corporate contributions and private investments to the Moon lander bid, and “had the financial potential to increase” that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZjXzG"&gt;Backed by the world’s richest man, Blue Origin indicated in its protest that the $5.9 billion price — nearly double SpaceX’s proposal — was partially based on an assumption that NASA would have more than enough money from Congress to pay for the proposal, even as Congress &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/senate-bill-offers-nasa-only-a-fraction-of-requested-lunar-lander-funding/"&gt;had been indicating&lt;/a&gt; a month before Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/national-team-submits-moon-proposal-to-nasa"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; its proposal last December that it wouldn’t give NASA all the funding it said it needed. In NASA’s response, the attorneys said companies were instructed to submit their best proposal first. They pointed to seven instances where NASA told bidders its award decision, and whether to pick one or two companies was based on how much funding it’d end up getting from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zuaTu"&gt;But Blue Origin argued that NASA should’ve canceled or changed the terms of the program when Congress voted to give the agency only a quarter of what it requested.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Blue Origin has also argued that it was unfair of NASA to only invite SpaceX to tweak parts of its proposal after selecting it for a potential award, one of many claims that NASA attacked over hundreds of pages of legal rebuttals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY4TC8"&gt;Overall, NASA effectively called BS on that argument, saying “Blue Origin made a bet and it lost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpP5U3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Blue Origin made a bet and it lost.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvTtFQ"&gt;Blue Origin “made an assumption about the Agency’s HLS budget, built its proposal with this figure in mind, and also separately made a calculated bet that if NASA could not afford Blue Origin’s initially-proposed price, the Agency would select Blue Origin for award and engage in post-selection negotiations to allow Blue Origin to lower its price. All of these assumptions were incorrect,” the four NASA attorneys wrote in the so-called Agency Report, dated May 26th. “Realizing now that it gambled and lost, Blue Origin seeks to use GAO’s procurement oversight function to improperly compel NASA to suffer the consequences of Blue Origin’s ill-conceived choices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BPrFfT"&gt;The company disagrees with NASA’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;assessment.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“I wouldn’t say that we didn’t offer our best offer when we put in our proposal ... I think we did give a great offer,” Megan Mitchell, Blue Origin’s vice president of government relations, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. “I’m not going to comment on NASA characterizing it as gambling — we disagree with that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LISLa"&gt;The lunar lander program is the centerpiece of NASA’s efforts to get humans on the Moon under a speedy 2024 timeline, set two years ago by the Trump administration. SpaceX, the sole awardee of the Moonshot phase of the program, will carry out two core missions: a demonstration mission to the Moon’s surface without any astronauts and a subsequent mission &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;astronauts. Blue Origin’s National Team and defense contractor Dynetics were the two bidders with lunar lander proposals that lost to SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CdelNB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This time, the bet simply did not work out in Blue Origin’s favor.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJl3bK"&gt;Blue Origin executives may have thought that the negotiation tactic would work because it had in the past. In April 2020, a year before&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;SpaceX’s $2.9 billion award was made, all three bidders were awarded some NASA development funding in an initial phase of the program intended to help the companies build up their respective lunar landers. SpaceX got $135 million, Dynetics got $253 million, and Blue Origin’s National Team got $579 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE6JlU"&gt;Blue Origin had initially proposed roughly $879 million for those development contracts when proposals for the award were due in November 2019, NASA filings indicate. Blue Origin offered a roughly $300 million discount and dropped the price by about 35 percent, to $579 million, after NASA requested meetings to negotiate. The agency attorneys said the outcome of these discussions, where Blue Origin ended up winning the biggest chunk of funding, inspired Blue Origin’s “gamble” with the subsequent competition, where it pitched its Blue Moon lander for $5.9 billion. “But NASA had no obligation to make this request” for a negotiation that time around, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJx1aw"&gt;“This time, the bet simply did not work out in Blue Origin’s favor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i51dO2"&gt;Sherwood’s declaration from April was one of several attempts to show that NASA was prejudiced in favor of SpaceX and acted unfairly against Blue Origin. But NASA said “a vague commitment to a sizeable, non-specific discount is not enough to demonstrate prejudice.” Months later, and just four days before the Government Accountability Office (GAO) ruled on Blue Origin’s protest, Bezos himself stepped in and got specific in an unusual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594038/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-2-billion"&gt;open letter to NASA administrator Bill Nelson&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos said he would give the agency a $2 billion discount on Blue Origin’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJanR6"&gt;But it wasn’t enough to change minds at NASA. The GAO ultimately sided with the agency, saying that showing examples of prejudice “is an essential element of any viable protest,” and that Blue Origin failed to do so. As for Blue Origin’s argument that NASA’s discussions with SpaceX were unfair, since Blue Origin didn’t get the same chance to talk, the GAO brushed it off, saying agency officials have “broad discretion” to meet when and with whom they please under the type of contracting rules involved. “An agency’s decision not to initiate discussions is a matter we generally will not review,” GAO attorney Thomas Armstrong said in a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5W1FXh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A tiny win at the GAO, and a springboard to federal court&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Z9ZQ"&gt;Blue Origin’s protest, though, wasn’t a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; failure. It alleged that one of the ways NASA gave SpaceX an unfair advantage was when the agency, for SpaceX only, “waived” its requirement to schedule government safety reviews before each launch of its Starship vehicle in its proposal. These safety reviews, called Flight Readiness Reviews, should come 14 days before each rocket launch within the company’s plan to get to the Moon, per the rules of the competition. Blue Origin’s proposal had indicated it could send Blue Moon to the lunar surface in as much as three commercial rocket launches with a safety review for each launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFxRc81IhFKZaHCN3BEeBPVZ8ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887128/Sep_29_2021_08_42_36.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Starship prototype, the top-half portion designed to land on the Moon, sticks its first clean test landing in May at SpaceX’s private facilities in Texas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2BENtb"&gt;SpaceX’s proposal involved 16 launches, with just one official safety review. The 16 launches include one launch of an orbital fuel station, 14 launches of “fuel tankers” to fill up the fuel station in orbit, and one launch of the Moon-bound Starship that will fill up at the fuel station to travel the rest of the way to the lunar surface (launching off Earth uses up a lot of fuel, so Starship will need a top-off before it carries on to the Moon). SpaceX said each of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1425473261551423489?s=20"&gt;roughly&lt;/a&gt; 14 fuel tankers would launch 12 days apart, a cadence that NASA officials said was “logically inconsistent” with its requirement to have a safety review 14 days before each launch. So when NASA invited SpaceX to negotiate the terms of its proposal, they agreed to have three reviews in all, one for each &lt;em&gt;type &lt;/em&gt;of rocket launch — one for the orbital depot, one for all the tankers, and one for the Moon-bound Starship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3X8W6"&gt;But that’s where NASA messed up, Blue Origin claims. And for once, the GAO’s Armstrong partially agreed. NASA attorneys said the agency’s rules were broad enough to allow flexibility with the reviews, but Armstrong sided with Blue Origin’s interpretation that a single review had to come before each launch. Still, Armstrong denied Blue Origin’s overall argument because the company didn’t explain how NASA’s alleged screwup gave SpaceX an unfair advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sLdYPx"&gt;Round 2: Suing NASA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ul3V3"&gt;To Blue Origin attorneys, the GAO ruling was valuable feedback for a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; legal challenge, this time in the US Court of Federal Claims — the last venue capable of hearing contract grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDpQzt"&gt;Blue Origin sued NASA in court weeks after the GAO rejected its protest. In its complaint, which was shrouded under seal until last week, the company centers its new fight on the main area it fell short on during the GAO dispute: proving NASA was prejudiced against Blue Origin and gave SpaceX an unfair advantage. The debates over SpaceX’s Flight Readiness Reviews, where the GAO signaled its support for Blue Origin, is the basis for its unfair advantage argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbYqOp"&gt;“That is not what SpaceX proposed, it is not in the final architecture, and that’s the problem,” Blue Origin’s Mitchell said of the revised safety reviews. “For Blue Origin, and I think more broadly for our entire industry, this is a serious safety issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t2H4tP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These claims from a losing bidder are patently inaccurate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0z3JBr"&gt;Pushing back on Blue Origin’s arguments in a white paper sent to lawmakers earlier this month, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, SpaceX said it plans to conduct safety reviews prior to every Starship launch, as it has in the past “for every single operational launch and test flight,” and that Blue Origin is conflating mere contract payment dates with actual safety reviews. It dismissed Blue Origin as a sore loser: “These claims from a losing bidder are patently inaccurate.” And SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted last week: “We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="68WxZu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1440736242195329028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqJRLE"&gt;Blue Origin argues in its &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185/gov.uscourts.uscfc.44185.47.0.pdf"&gt;59-page complaint&lt;/a&gt; that, had the company known NASA was going to be flexible on the safety review requirements, it would’ve “engineered and proposed an entirely different architecture” for a lower price that would’ve given it a “substantial chance for award.” Specifically how NASA’s flexible safety review requirements would allow Blue Origin to change its proposal of just three review-worthy launches is unclear. The company attempted to explain how in a small paragraph in its complaint, but it was mostly redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEXTRb"&gt;NASA made little to no mention of Blue Origin’s safety review argument in its main response to the GAO protest, and it’s unclear what the agency is saying in court, because much of it is under seal. But when it invited SpaceX to revise its proposals in April, NASA said it believed three safety reviews for each type of rocket launch “meets the intent of” the review requirements outlined in NASA’s competition rules. In other words, NASA figured its modified safety review arrangement is good enough, considering how novel and unexpected SpaceX’s approach of launching several Starships in such a rapid cadence is. And in another recently unsealed filing, SpaceX says its unconventional Starship approach is the result of NASA encouraging companies to have the “liberty to propose a different architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63jhKfeRjA0uf_z_UgLlawZO9q0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887143/51369631902_ce4f03c26a_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using cranes, SpaceX workers in Texas guide the top half of Starship onto its Super Heavy booster for a “full stack” demonstration in August, in this composite image tweeted by Musk at the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2127p"&gt;Now, NASA wants all the litigation to stop as soon as possible so the gears of its lunar lander program can start turning. The agency agreed last month to pause SpaceX’s contract while the lawsuit carries on only if Blue Origin agreed to a quicker litigation schedule that wraps up November 1st. Blue Origin, NASA, and SpaceX are currently duking it out before the court, most recently arguing over Blue Origin’s request to add more documents and internal NASA emails into the court’s record for review. The company also wants the judge to approve the release of a less-redacted version of its complaint, but NASA and SpaceX are pushing back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBRNv4"&gt;If the court ultimately agrees with Blue Origin and finds NASA messed up, the agency would likely have to cancel SpaceX’s contract, as Blue Origin requests, and reopen the competition to allow the companies to submit new proposals — a significant setback for the agency’s Moon program. If Blue Origin loses, the monthslong hold on SpaceX’s contract would disappear, allowing work with NASA on Starship to begin, and Blue Origin would be invited to pitch its lander for a future Moon lander competition. But the delay itself already poses risks for NASA. In one of its filings to the GAO, NASA attorneys laid out their fears: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5KrTC"&gt;“What begins as a mere procurement delay all too easily turns into a lack of political support, a budget siphoned off for other efforts, and ultimately, a shelved mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmTXmr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887155/r_76c___MOL_Blue_Origin_B_419783.1__Final_Corrected_Copy__Public_Redacted.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the lightly redacted version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; of NASA’s “Agency Report” to the GAO, filed in May in response to Blue Origin’s protest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends’ biggest stars turn into anime heroes in Worlds 2021 music video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDanQE41N7GdfpHVHRMPKAkYsaw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925467/BIAD_ClientThumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv2c0W"&gt;Every year ahead of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship, developer Riot tries to get everyone excited with a new song. This year’s anthem is called “Burn It All Down” from American band Pvris, and it definitely fits into the tradition of music to get players amped up. But it also comes with a bonus: a music video that turns some of the game’s best players into anime heroes. (Journalist Ashley Kang has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AshleyKang/status/1443006521089028098"&gt;a great thread&lt;/a&gt; detailing who is who.) It’s the kind of short that makes you want a full &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; esports anime, and it even transitions to a 3D art style at the end, in a nod to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688837/netflix-arcane-league-of-legends-trailer-show-riot-games-release-date"&gt;the upcoming Netflix series &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKcEzI"&gt;This year’s iteration of Worlds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22649691/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-europe"&gt;will take place in Iceland starting October 5th&lt;/a&gt;; it was originally slated for China but was forced to move due to pandemic-related restrictions. Even if you aren’t into competitive &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;, it’s usually worth tuning in for a bit to see the technical wizardry on display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;Last year featured a virtual stage built using the same tech behind &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and past opening ceremonies have showcased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;concerts using holograms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t be fooled — Amazon’s Astro isn’t a home robot, it’s a camera on wheels</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Hd254s6u05cgMrW-6QNIkFZxss=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925420/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_9.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E12dOp"&gt;Yesterday, Amazon announced its “home robot” — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;wheeled device named Astro&lt;/a&gt; that has a display, an array of sensors, and a camera that periscopes out the top of its body like a mast. In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sj1t3msy8dc"&gt;advertisements for Astro&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon presents the device as an engineering breakthrough and the realization of a long-held sci-fi dream: to build a robot that can help around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf9Q35"&gt;This is rubbish, of course. What Astro is — for better or worse — is a camera on wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0fFgk3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astro definitely can’t get a beer for you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="woa5WA"&gt;The physical limitations of Astro are obvious. It has no arms or manipulators; no way to interact with the world other than bumping into objects at shin height. It can’t navigate steps, and, according to employees who worked on the robot and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypp8/leaked-documents-amazon-astro-surveillance-robot-tracking"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is fragile and prone to self-destruction. “Astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity,” one told the publication. (Oh, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22699251/amazon-astro-robot-cannot-fetch-your-beer"&gt;absolutely cannot get a beer for you&lt;/a&gt; — a recurring meme when companies try to hype home robots). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="picD5q"&gt;But Amazon is still offering customers quite a bit with Astro, and for those worried about the privacy implications of this technology, the basic usefulness of the device needs to be reckoned with. Amazon says Astro will use facial recognition to identify people in your home and recognize intruders. (Again, though, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reports that this feature works poorly in the real world.) The bot can be set to “patrol” your house at night and can be activated and steered remotely, letting you peek through its periscope camera via your phone. In Amazon’s ad, a couple use this feature to double check they turned the stove off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HOmxxA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj1t3msy8dc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHsdiv"&gt;This is silly stuff, but it’s useful, too. These are features many people will want. Everyone cares about keeping their home safe and, if you’re already investing in home surveillance but don’t want to put a camera in every room, then Astro may seem like an attractive solution. (Whether people will pay $999 for the pleasure, and whether Astro will actually work as promised, are open questions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5qz3L"&gt;It’s also worth remembering that although many people distrust or dislike Amazon because of its consistently appalling mistreatment of workers, its union-busting, and its tax avoidance, the company actually remains fairly beloved by the American public. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;survey &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; ran in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon had the most favorable impression in the US of any tech firm and was judged to be second-most trustworthy after Microsoft. So the fact that &lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt; is selling this roving camera won’t necessarily put people off the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTl3PU"&gt;Astro is also important for Amazon’s grand strategy. The company’s vision for tech is one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696187/amazon-alexa-ambient-disappearing-computer-limp-interview"&gt;ambient computing&lt;/a&gt; — of rigging together a network of sensors, smart speakers, cameras, and digital assistants that are integrated into users’ homes. The company wants to provide convenience by organizing customers’ lives, ideally for a recurring subscription fee, just like with its Prime delivery service. And since it acquired video doorbell firm Ring in 2018, home security and surveillance have been an increasingly important part of this offering. So while many will complain that Astro is essentially a surveillance device, that suits Amazon fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EjdYFW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has an extremely shady history when it comes to surveillance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxTc0y"&gt;Personally, I think Astro is a half-baked concept and part of a dangerous trend of ubiquitous and unthinking surveillance. Although I accept the fact that many people want this sort of technology in their home, Amazon in particular has repeatedly shown a lack of care and honesty in how it develops this sort of tech. In the past, the company has sold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;racially biased facial recognition systems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/20/21031758/amazon-ring-hack-security-login-username"&gt;hackable security cameras&lt;/a&gt;; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;aggressively partners with law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and uses &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywaa57/how-ring-transmits-fear-to-american-suburbs"&gt;scare tactics to push its products on consumers&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at this history, I’m not sure why &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; would trust Amazon to oversee these sorts of systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Sa7Nx"&gt;But this is where Astro’s guise as a “home robot” becomes useful. For many people looking at Astro, it may appear to be just a novelty — indeed, it’s already drawn comparisons to robot “pets” like Aibo. But I think, like Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;camera-equipped Ray-Ban glasses&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose of Astro is not to solve any particular problem but to neutralize the underlying concept: to get people used to having a camera that moves constantly around their home. Astro isn’t a home robot, it’s a camera on wheels, and that’s just what Amazon wants. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find your lost iPhone — even if it’s off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxmdXDJ2xj6wpidTTrR5CzNWgyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925408/vpavic_4547_20210421_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJ0xk1"&gt;Apple’s Find My app has been a very useful (and reassuring) feature, allowing you to locate a misplaced (or stolen) phone so that you can retrieve it (or contact the authorities, if that’s safer). With the expansion of Find My to a variety of other objects, especially via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, it’s become even more useful. And now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; brings with it the capability to locate your phone even if the battery has run out or it’s been turned off, the utility of Find My has become even greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JISZ2u"&gt;(Note: you can also use the Find My app to help with your own security — to share your location with individuals and send recurring notifications of when you leave and arrive. You can find directions for setting that up in our article “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676312/ios-iphone-apple-location-tracking-turn-off-on"&gt;How to use iPhone’s location tracking&lt;/a&gt;.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czJIfR"&gt;If you’re new to the iPhone or have never set up the Find My app yet, here’s how you start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zIfTal"&gt;Go to your settings, tap on your name, and then on “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LuzA3e"&gt;Tap on “Find My iPhone.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mIyfi6"&gt;Toggle “Find My iPhone” on. If you have upgraded to iOS 15, you can also activate “Find My network,” which will let you find your phone even if it’s offline. “Send Last Location” will send the location of your iPhone to your Apple account when the battery is about to die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on the Find My feature in your settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEyLTj__UBAbTD4HpxYhdYbZFn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884575/IMG_49615EE7ED8B_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on the Find My feature in your settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNDYVuILGJl6ncQVRmWvCChpZxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884577/IMG_E77E43DD93EA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn on “Find My network” to find your phone when it’s off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IAs1td"&gt;And that’s it! After that, if you can’t find your iPhone, then you can track it either by using the Find My app on a Mac (or another iPhone, if you have one) or on any browser by going to &lt;a href="http://iCloud.com/find"&gt;iCloud.com/find&lt;/a&gt; and signing in using your Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WCkuy"&gt;If you’re using the web version, then you’ll see a green dot that locates your iPhone. Select the dot and then the circled “i” (for information), and you’ll be given the choice of having your phone play a sound, erasing it, or putting it on “Lost Mode.” In “Lost Mode,” you can enter a phone number where you can be reached and a message (“Please return this phone asap!”). After that, the phone will be locked until you re-enter its passcode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtyCr1Ryk_qdHRUm_kBoMOlC5oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884619/Screen_Shot_2021_09_28_at_10.10.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you locate your phone, send a notification, or erase it. (Note: the map has been blurred for privacy reasons.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XMD6QL"&gt;If you’re using the Find My app, you’ll get basically the same features (except in a more aesthetically pleasing form), along with map directions on how to get to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTXF7S"&gt;And yes — if you’re using iOS 15 on your iPhone, you will be able to locate it even if it’s run out of battery power or has been shut off. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Find My can locate a phone even if it’s off — as long as it has iOS 15 installed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Gh52_nYw0SlvCzEQB_hNMpsde4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884670/Screen_Shot_2021_09_27_at_4.50.43_PM.png"&gt;

    <title>Bose QuietComfort 45 review: comfortably familiar</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A masterclass in going back to what works&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="57iLed"&gt;Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, are a perfectly fine pair of premium noise-canceling headphones. They’re Bose’s attempt to leapfrog Sony and other competitors with a revamped, sleek design and more powerful active noise cancellation. But for some of the company’s most loyal fans, they veer off a little too far from what they expect Bose headphones to be. The NCH 700s don’t have the same feather-light comfort as the QuietComfort lineup, they annoyingly can’t be folded for easy carrying, and generally, it seems like Bose needlessly tried to fix something that wasn’t broken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifa8HA"&gt;But with the new $329 QuietComfort 45 noise-canceling headphones, there’s no reinventing the wheel. This time, Bose is sticking much closer to the formula that led to such success for the QuietComfort 35 and 35 II. That model became an essential piece of kit for combatting the din of cities or hushing the train commute, and you see them on every flight. The QC45s aren’t considered Bose’s flagship headphones anymore, but with additions like USB-C, improved ANC, and longer battery life, they’re just what some people have been waiting for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ljreX1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10779029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iwyyH0"&gt;With the QC45s, Bose is moving away from the flashy, “modern” style of the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 and going back to what worked. The steel headband, which seamlessly continued down into metal rods that made for a much smoother motion when adjusting the fit, is gone. Now, we’re back to the proudly plastic QuietComfort aesthetic that feels surprisingly durable (thanks to metal hinges at the pivot points) and the familiar ratcheting when you extend the ear cups has also returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8OUtt"&gt;The swipey touchpad controls of the NCH 700s are also history. Bose has essentially just copied and pasted the physical buttons of the QC35 IIs: on the underside of the right earcup are dedicated controls for volume and a multi-function button for track controls and summoning a voice assistant. On the left is a button that switches between ANC and Bose’s “aware” (transparency) mode; the latter is a feature that the QC35s didn’t offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgeEn8QS5fmt3RpAGVjzP1b7lgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883429/cwelch_202109_4775_5635.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QuietComfort 45 headphones look very similar to their predecessors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdrH49"&gt;The look and in-hand feel of the QC45s and QC 35 IIs are extremely similar. The only telltale sign that distinguishes the new headphones from older models is the USB-C port at the bottom of the right ear cup. A more subtle clue is that the Bose logo is no longer raised and is now just stamped onto the ear cups. Otherwise, it’s difficult to tell them apart by eyeballing it. The newer headphones weigh slightly more (8.5 ounces compared to 8.3), but that’s not a difference I ever noticed when wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elZHFrgmyXUCuG0habSuXVHvUOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887195/DSCF5714_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones at left, Bose’s QC45 at right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PrFUtd"&gt;Staying true to their predecessors, the QC45s are splendidly comfortable. I’ve worn them for stretches of three to five hours without any hint of unpleasant aching or soreness at the top of my head. The clamping force is very gentle, so you won’t feel them squeezing on the sides of your dome — even if you’re like me and have an oversized head. Bose says it has eliminated some “pleats and puckers” and reduced gaps between components, but crucially, none of these minor tweaks have had a negative impact on comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgXlalI_izzjDTJhluluEO1YDBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883427/cwelch_202109_4775_5625.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose has made minor design tweaks to the ear cushions and headband.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsfe4dYJrFIShsAVvbJHpM5F23s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883430/cwelch_202109_4775_5637.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But other aspects of the hardware stick to a familiar formula.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkfoBf"&gt;Aside from their physical design contrasts, the QC45s and Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 also approach noise cancellation differently. With the more expensive headphones, Bose gives you precise control over the amount of ANC applied, so you can dial in exactly the level you want. But on the newer pair, you only get two choices: “quiet” is standard ANC mode, and “aware” is a transparency feature that pipes in environmental sound. Bose uses voice prompts to tell you which mode you’re in, and the “quiet” one amusingly sounds like you’re being scolded to shush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkBxYb"&gt;Strangely, at least right now, there’s no way to switch off both noise cancellation and transparency. You’ve got to pick one or the other, so you can’t listen to the QC45s in a more basic mode that would rely only on their natural passive noise isolation. This seems like a very weird thing to leave out, so I’m hoping Bose will add a simple “ANC off” option down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHkiXDu6qgODOi5epwiq-FC2wf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883431/cwelch_202109_4775_5643.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no way to turn ANC off unless you activate aware mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vnOBKI"&gt;That noise cancellation is a step up in its effectiveness from the QC35 IIs, and it’s right about on par with the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, Sony’s WH-1000XM4s, and the Apple AirPods Max. All of these headphones now do a tremendous job of quieting your surroundings and putting you in a private bubble with your music, podcasts, movies, or whatever else you’re using them for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gi70ac"&gt;And when you activate Bose’s aware mode, it’s designed not to overwhelm you with a sudden cacophony of outside noise. The company says it aimed for a balanced volume that lets you hear your environment without taking anything away from your tunes. I appreciate the intention — and the mix does work well — but this is another area where letting people dial in the level of ambient sound would’ve been nice. And again, that’s something the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 will give you, but not these. Wind noise is very noticeable and can get aggravating when you’re in aware mode, but it’s handled much better when ANC is enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yxvxe6VF9qPqH6WPKp_lxLFnWcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884900/DSCF5660_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QC45s can fold down for efficient storage in a bag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgr0aV"&gt;Bose also decided to forgo other nice-to-have features like automatic pausing when you remove the headphones. And the company doesn’t seem interested in matching Sony’s “speak to chat” trick where the headphones will temporarily pause audio whenever they detect that you’re speaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIgKE7"&gt;I can do without those, but I’m more annoyed by other omissions. You still can’t use the QC45s while they’re plugged in and charging. And charging is all that happens when you attach a USB-C cable; Bose doesn’t support audio over that connection, which is disappointing for headphones that cost over $300. There’s still the Bose-standard 2.5mm audio jack for wired listening with the included 2.5-to-3.5mm cable. So long as the battery isn’t dead, ANC also works in wired mode. You can even continue to listen plugged in when the battery is depleted — albeit with no noise cancellation and much worse sound quality since Bose’s Active EQ doesn’t work without power. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b-iZV9xEFUKiJDZhGMNARZ1brkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883424/cwelch_202109_4775_5647.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It would’ve been nice to see some EQ options in the Bose Music app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="klsuuF"&gt;Speaking of EQ, Bose doesn’t currently let you customize it on the QuietComfort 45s, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; on the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Considering the price of the QC45s, there’s no excuse not to add EQ adjustments to these headphones. It’s too important of a feature to be positioned as some differentiator when both of these cans are so expensive. The adjustable noise cancellation is enough to set the NCH 700s apart. Bose tells me there are no immediate plans for firmware updates or pending new features for the QC45s. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYfHRYTdCFMDEdI-n4_c21gXLkU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887196/DSCF5709.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have a hard time finding a more comfortable pair of headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="765PNx"&gt;And then there’s the sound, which from what the company tells me, hasn’t changed one iota from the QuietComfort 35 IIs — at least not on purpose. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dms3tv/status/1441178996096462851?s=21"&gt;some early technical measurements&lt;/a&gt; that show Bose has cleaned up the tuning a bit, but to my ears and those I’ve let demo both headphones, they’re very, very close. And to me, that’s a good outcome. If there’s one consistency among Bose headphones, it’s that they’re remarkably &lt;em&gt;listenable&lt;/em&gt;. The bass is subdued compared to Sony’s 1000XM4s, and the high end is similarly laid back and never too sharp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xbWSJcew8Cvag5zU2f6vmofxYgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883438/cwelch_202109_4775_5606.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose has made the switch to USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ND8DJc8UmhkE8d2YdcZYbcpQH9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883437/cwelch_202109_4775_5608.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphones come in black or “smoke white.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sUtykDR4PMUFukcSKFt0yrYwkRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883432/cwelch_202109_4775_5610.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This button toggles between ANC and transparency modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NiGnIYP7OPocgnfM7T0ro51iKso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883428/cwelch_202109_4775_5630.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The volume and multi-function buttons are very similar to the controls from the QC35 IIs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8xnsTy"&gt;These aren’t headphones that are going to fill your ears with captivating detail or a sophisticated soundstage, but unless you need a ton of boom from the bass, there’s really nothing I’d label underwhelming about the audio. Bose continues to support multipoint for two simultaneous connections, and the QC45s now have Bluetooth 5.1 for expanded range and more robust performance. As for codecs, they stick to the very status quo SBC and AAC, leaving out more advanced options like aptX Adaptive or LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="3mY0uA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10779967"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XpWwpB"&gt;Sound quality might be largely unchanged, but Bose &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; made refinements to microphone performance. There’s now a fourth external mic that aids with voice pickup, and Bose says a noise-rejecting algorithm filters out background sounds for clearer calls than were possible on the QC35 IIs. Everyone said I came through clearly and that nothing sounded muffled when making phone calls or chatting over Zoom with the QC45s. Battery life has also very modestly improved from 20 hours to 24 on the new headphones. They can be fully charged up in 2.5 hours, and in a low-battery pinch, a 15-minute top-off should get you three hours of listening time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CfwxVOxP9R5WhpCDNHgKf8id3m4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883435/cwelch_202109_4775_5619.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other supported features include multipoint and synced audio with Bose’s soundbars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QT2a1g"&gt;The QuietComfort 45s are Bose at its best. They’re not some grand departure, and they adhere so closely to what’s come before that it’s easy to perceive them as less ambitious than the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. But with their enhancements to noise cancellation, a useful new aware mode, and other tweaks, Bose has added ample appeal to what was already a solid foundation. And you’re not simply going to find a more comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones. I just hope the company unlocks their fullest potential with some firmware updates in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first plug-in hybrid Jeep Grand Cherokee is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQKe_0HGHRO6ZXI3-JFZiDoaGv0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925135/JP022_105GC.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zoH340"&gt;Jeep revealed the 2022 Grand Cherokee 4xe, the first plug-in hybrid version of the automaker’s best-selling SUV. It is the second Jeep vehicle to get an electrified version, following the hybrid 2021 Wrangler 4xe released last year. Jeep also announced an off-roading version of the Grand Cherokee, the Trailhawk, which also comes with a hybrid motor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u5MtL"&gt;Tellingly, Jeep is not announcing a pure electric version of the Grand Cherokee, nor selling any battery-electric vehicles. The automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568306/jeep-ev-hybrid-wagoneer-wrangler-cherokee-stellantis"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would release “zero-emission” versions of all of its vehicles by 2025, along with plug-hybrid variants. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK1kIhY10vdxIxSRaaiYSG6DziE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885761/JP022_112GC.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DnUjXn"&gt;The Grand Cherokee 4xe (“four by E” in Jeep parlance) is estimated to get 25 miles of all-electric range and 57 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe) for a total driving range of more than 440 miles (708 km). Jeep says that its plug-in hybrid propulsion system includes two electric motors, a 400-volt battery pack, 2.0-liter turbocharged, four-cylinder engine, and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Overall, the 4xe system delivers 375 horsepower (280 kW) and 470 lb.-ft. (637 Nm) of torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVUdgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drivers can tailor the energy output to best suite their driving situation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YwXuwD"&gt;Drivers can tailor the energy output to best suit their driving situation. There are three modes to choose from: Hybrid, which blends torque from the electric motor and gas engine; Electric, which operates on zero-emission electric power only until the battery is depleted; and eSave, which prioritizes the engine, saving the battery charge for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrVGbK"&gt;Owners can monitor the hybrid system through the infotainment screen, as well as the amount of power created by regenerative braking. Regen can be adjusted for minimum and maximum levels to best suit driving styles and the amount of power it creates. Drivers can also schedule charging times to take advantage of lower electric rates and view their driving history with detail of electric and gasoline usage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlG3epV-8C2TDMMGIM8UVbPWqs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885744/JP022_126GC.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ryauVv"&gt;The Grand Cherokee’s 4xe system also includes something called an Integrated Dual Charging Module (ICDM) that combines a battery charger and a DC/DC converter in a single unit and a Power Inverter Module (PIM) that is reduced in size. These are mounted under the vehicle and protected with steel shields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2JJec"&gt;Jeep’s are meant to be taken off-road, and as such, the company claims its electronic are properly sealed and waterproofed. Jeep says the Grand Cherokee 4xe is capable of water fording up to 24 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFRfpE"&gt;Jeep did not announce pricing for the 2022 Grand Cherokee, though if the Wrangler’s window-sticker price is any indication, it won’t be cheap. (The 2021 Wrangler 4xe Sahara starts at $52,520, the Rubicon at $56,220, and the High Altitude at $58,340.) The federal EV tax credit of $7,500 should take some of the sting out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SyKqsP2bIi0zGgvRmPNKVDNClFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885748/JP022_132GC.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c7OwXb"&gt;Whether customers flock to Jeep’s new hybrid powertrains remains untested. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/2021-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-rubicon-4xe-a-hybrid-that-comes-up-short-11632498123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Dan Neil&lt;/a&gt; recently panned the 2021 Wrangler 4xe, calling it “shameless greenwashing, unable to clear the lowest speed bump of skepticism.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="477TdT"&gt;The company, which is an iconic American brand, has been slow to embrace electric vehicle technology compared to its competitors. Whether the new Grand Cherokee can help Jeep pick up the pace remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is $600 off at Best Buy today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gerdt_3Gt3iO9tom3D_XUMqbeI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69925017/cfaulkner_200929_4214_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AgpNDo"&gt;Despite not being the newest model, the 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced still offers plenty of power, which makes its current, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfF60uDiEQl#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$600 discount at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; something to consider. Although we saw an even deeper discount on the 15-inch laptop earlier this month that brought it down to $1,600, today’s $1,800 price remains a solid deal for a laptop that has an RTX 2070 Super graphics chip and a fast 300Hz refresh rate display. It even comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, allowing you to give your new hardware several benchmark tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUwg8o"&gt;There are plenty of options when it comes to gaming laptops, but it's tough to beat the Razer Blade 15 Advanced in terms of performance and portability. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8IwWSm"&gt;The Anker Nebula Capsule Max is a great way to watch movies in your backyard or even while camping. The diminutive, can-shaped projector has a built-in battery for up to four hours of playback and comes equipped with Android 8.1, letting you download and stream content in 720p from YouTube or Netflix without having to connect the device to an external source. Weighing in at just 1.6 pounds, the Anker Nebula Capsule Max is a great companion for any camping trip or backyard movie night, whether you intend to project a 100-inch image on your wall or something a bit smaller. Normally $470, it’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TF834PT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $399&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yBq2j3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10778031"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jazOyI"&gt;Aukey’s Basix Pro Wireless Power Bank — which is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faukeyplus.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower-bank%2Fproducts%2Faukey-basix-pro-wireless-power-bank-20000mah&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F29%2F22697131%2Frazer-gaming-laptop-anker-projector-aukey-charger-xbox-hard-drive-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Aukey for $20&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE20 &lt;/strong&gt;— is one of the most versatile power banks we’ve seen recently. The slim battery pack holds up to 20,000mAh of juice and can provide any of your Qi-compatible devices with up to 10 watts of power, allowing you to charge a device like the iPhone 11 four times over. The compact device also comes with USB-C and USB-A ports that provide up to 18 watts of power, a kickstand that allows it to function as a charging stand, and a handy LED readout on the side that notes the pack’s current charge level at the press of a button. While the bank itself does need to be plugged in to charge, not having to worry about where you left the cord for your phone when it's on its last legs is definitely handy.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZyEz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10778571"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6tJNPf"&gt;If you’re on the hunt for a capable pair of headphones, the Beyerdynamic Lagoon might be for you. These classy and durable headphones can last up to 45 hours on a single charge — or 24.5 hours with active noise cancellation enabled — and can be controlled either via voice commands or with their touch-sensitive ear cups. The LED lighting inside the ear cups is more functional than decorative, too, and changes colors to indicate the battery level and Bluetooth pairing status. These headphones are great for anyone who’s in the market for a solid pair of cans and, right now, they’re available for their &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fbeyerdynamic-715517-black%2Fp%2FN82E16826380045" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lowest price ever ($150) at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;972HRFCL88&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FHF2fW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10778654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wk1hZk"&gt;If those massive file sizes have got your Xbox feeling a little bit heavy, this external hard drive from Western Digital is currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfF8JeuX705#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Best Buy for $150&lt;/a&gt;, nearly its best price to date. The 1TB drive is optimized for Xbox consoles, but thanks to USB 3.0 connectivity, it’s compatible with PCs as well. The drive does use a slower HDD and caps out at a 400MB/s transfer speed, but this shouldn’t be too much of an issue unless you’re transferring massive files on a regular basis. There are definitely faster drives on the market, but the WD Gaming Drive is a good option for anyone looking to quickly expand the storage capacity of their Xbox or PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As privacy issues worsen, Congress looks to the FTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ox3481r2HJwwH44X2JsF3jbi6EM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924995/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qzguN"&gt;Lawmakers are preparing to hold the first in a series of data privacy hearings on Wednesday in a fresh effort to bolster consumer data protections on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="za971w"&gt;On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee plans to discuss the creation of a new privacy bureau at the FTC and “the need for a comprehensive federal privacy law.” It’s an uncomfortable dodge since Congress has thus far been unable to pass any such privacy law. But with states enacting their own privacy framework, there’s more pressure than ever for some part of the federal government to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4XXQX"&gt;As legislative efforts have stalled, the FTC could be the Biden administration’s best bet at regulating the tech industry’s grasp over consumer data, even if it could take years to finish the agency’s rulemaking process. Still, experts fear the agency may not have the power, by itself, to issue strong enough rules to truly reel in tech’s data power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rrbBLO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That is not an effective way to build trust with consumers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bx4fhd"&gt;“If Congress doesn’t pass privacy laws, and we spend the next six to 15 years in a [rulemaking] process where the FTC has to hobble together a set of rules within the confines of their existing regulatory authority, that is not an effective way to build trust with consumers about the way companies are handling their data,” Morgan Reed, President of The App Association, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview Tuesday. Reed is expected to testify at Wednesday’s hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvDbHy"&gt;Still, the FTC is in the best position to enact some form of privacy regulation — and lawmakers have started piling on the pressure for the agency to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmzPf4"&gt;Last week, several lawmakers, including a handful on the Senate Commerce Committee, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684394/ftc-data-privacy-facial-recognition-blumenthal-warren-khan"&gt;wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; to FTC Chair Lina Khan calling on the commission to write its own data privacy rules. The request came just a few months after the FTC voted to update its rulemaking procedures, making it easier for the agency to issue data rules. The letter also followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671880/biden-alvaro-bedoya-privacy-ftc-commissioner-facial-recognition"&gt;President Joe Biden’s nomination &lt;/a&gt;of Alvaro Bedoya, a longtime privacy and facial recognition critic, to become the third FTC Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhAPWm"&gt;“In parallel to congressional efforts to create federal privacy laws to give power back to consumers, the Commission should take advantage of every tool in its toolkit to protect consumers’ privacy,” the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684394/ftc-data-privacy-facial-recognition-blumenthal-warren-khan"&gt;lawmakers wrote&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sleE6z"&gt;Congress is also mulling over the possibility of sending the FTC an additional &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-panel-votes-approve-1-billion-ftc-privacy-probes-2021-09-14/"&gt;$1 billion in funding&lt;/a&gt; through the proposed $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package to build out a new bureau to focus solely on privacy enforcement. But with Republicans and moderate Senate Democrats opposed to the trillions in additional funding, the money could be left in legislative limbo until both the House and Senate approve a separate bipartisan infrastructure package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY7HzP"&gt;“The FTC is not very well-funded to do this kind of work. It has limited resources and limited capabilities to engage in privacy work, plus all of the other work it has to do,” Sara Collins, privacy policy counsel at Public Knowledge, said Tuesday. “It’s a competition authority. It’s a general consumer protection authority. They have to have more resources to do this work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjdQ5T"&gt;Still, experts like Collins are optimistic that any new FTC rulemaking could force Congress’ hand on legislative reform. Several states, including California and Colorado, have already enacted their own state bills as well. This patchwork of regulation could build more momentum for lawmakers to tackle a federal law once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fSbe8"&gt;“I think it’s really important to develop strong privacy laws while also giving the Commission the authority to enforce those and to conduct rulemaking specifically on privacy technology vendors,” Jeff Gary, policy director at Georgetown’s Technology, Law and Policy Institute, said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuUojp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ah fuck: YouTube takes down classic ‘I can’t believe you’ve done this’ meme </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EhnpJwMGpKhxqrprRzgqzzKvZoI=/78x0:749x447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924627/Screen_Shot_2021_09_29_at_10.19.08_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;Ah, fuck’&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;a frame of Weedon getting socked in the face by his friend Tim from the original upload. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JP9Z5p"&gt;Whether it wants to be or not, YouTube is a guardian of internet history, with countless classic videos sitting in its archives. That makes it jarring when the company acts like what it is: a multinational corporation with no real understanding of this value. Case in point, this week YouTube removed the original upload of the “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;Ah fuck, I can’t believe you’ve done this&lt;/a&gt;” meme, rejecting an appeal from its creator (and the guy who can’t believe this was done) and claiming that the clip violates the company’s “violent or graphic content policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADM4jv"&gt;In the words of &lt;a href="http://paulweedon.co.uk/"&gt;Paul Weedon&lt;/a&gt; himself, star of and uploader of the original video: Ah, fuck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cypzMC"&gt;Weedon tweeted out the news of the takedown and his unsuccessful appeal, noting that the video had been on YouTube for 14 years, and racked up 12 million views in that time with “no issues whatsoever.” The clip itself is a classic: low-res, contextless, and instantly funny. And, of course, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/O7lRV1VHv1g"&gt;countless re-uploads&lt;/a&gt; still exist (alongside the other, legitimately horrible content that YouTube is happy to leave up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70haGN"&gt;“It completely out of the blue,” Weedon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; regarding the takedown. “I made the case that it’s been online going on 15 years and is basically part of internet culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R4Cc32"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well, that's that then. A fittingly stupid end to a stupid era. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UmZwwzrAjx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UmZwwzrAjx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Weedon (@Twotafkap) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twotafkap/status/1443099098438045697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TYDRV4"&gt;The video has been &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-cant-believe-youve-done-this"&gt;remixed and re-memed&lt;/a&gt; in countless ways since it first went viral in the mid-2010s, and Weedon himself has an interesting relationship with the content. In an &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4avnqj/my-life-as-a-meme-i-cant-believe-youve-done-this-revisited"&gt;article for &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, he describes how the clip was part of a series of “stunts” he and his friends filmed in the vein of &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt;, and how he sold the original rights for the video to the now-defunct &lt;a href="http://Break.com"&gt;Break.com&lt;/a&gt; and isn’t now sure who even owns the IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmVoXM"&gt;“At the time, going viral wasn’t really comparable to any other experience and it certainly wasn’t something I could discuss in solidarity with my friends,” writes Weedon. “All of a sudden you’re everywhere and it’s out of your control. You either try to fight it and get destroyed, or embrace it and try to cash in. After yanking down several other videos on my YouTube channel, I opted for the latter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieeNQv"&gt;To add insult to injury, Weedon is currently exploring the possibility of making a documentary about the meme, so this takedown adds a little twist to the proceedings. “This takes things in a completely different direction,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It says a lot about where YouTube is going. On Twitter, people seem to be saying the same thing: that this is a video that represents what YouTube used to be, and they’ve torched it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXLG9y"&gt;Weedon says he’s found all the footage from the day the meme was shot, and that he and a group of friends are still exploring how to tell the story. “We’re still figuring out what we want to do with it,” he says. “Though I definitely regret promising the documentary would be coming ‘soon’ in the teaser. I forgot how impatient people on the internet can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26eezh"&gt;We’ve reached out to YouTube for comment and will update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FUUguD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o1yfyzT3Q0c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AbL5kb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Wednesday September 29th, 6:13AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated the story with comment from Weedon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve reportedly developing standalone VR headset codenamed ‘Deckard’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgD3KeU2wVIr3bAQZHXrDKMBLI0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69924588/akrales_190528_3450_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve’s first VR headset, the Index.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DuUjII"&gt;Valve could have a second VR headset in development with a standalone design similar to what’s currently offered by Facebook’s lineup of Oculus Quest headsets. Evidence for the new headset was brought to light by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp42lQYVzwo"&gt;YouTuber Brad Lynch&lt;/a&gt;. He found multiple references in Valve’s SteamVR code to a device codenamed “Deckard” which he then cross-referenced against the company’s recent patent applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nztFh6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/a-new-standalone-valve-vr-headset-teased-by-deep-steamvr-file-dive/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; subsequently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; with its own sources that much of Lynch’s findings are accurate, and that Valve does have a second headset prototype in development. In contrast with the company’s first VR headset, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;Valve Index&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2019, the new headset has a built in processor that could allow it to work without being tethered to a PC by a cable. Valve also reportedly has ambitions for it to be able to track movement without needing external base stations (aka “inside-out” tracking). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L2mQH5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp42lQYVzwo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HqTnM3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars’ &lt;/em&gt;claims broadly line up with the code references Lynch outlines in his video. These include use of the term “standalone” and a code string that suggests it might have some internal processing power, which could allow it to function independently from an external PC. There are also references that suggest the new headset might have some measure of wireless connectivity, potentially via Wi-Fi. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;also reports that details about updated optics are also accurate, which could allow the headset’s lenses to be positioned closer to the user’s face for better comfort and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y50ZQw"&gt;Reports of a standalone headset are interesting in light of the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s handheld Steam Deck console&lt;/a&gt;, which runs on a semi-custom AMD processor. A Valve FAQ has made it clear that the current console is “&lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/faq"&gt;not optimized&lt;/a&gt;” for VR, but in an interview the company expressed an interest in one day using the processor in a standalone VR headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElDHdn"&gt;“We’re not ready to say anything about [using the AMD processor in a VR headset],” Valve’s Greg Coomer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;recent Steam Deck interview&lt;/a&gt;, “but it would run well in that environment, with the TDP necessary... it’s very relevant to us and our future plans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYUXei"&gt;Of course, Valve developing something internally is no guarantee it’ll ever see a commercial release. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;points towards the company’s &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app/"&gt;famous history&lt;/a&gt; of working on projects internally, only to kill them off. But the fact that the company has already released one VR headset, and is on the cusp of releasing its own standalone handheld console, has us hopeful that Deckard might one day make it to market.&lt;/p&gt;
