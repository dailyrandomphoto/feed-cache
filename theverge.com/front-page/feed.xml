    <title>The latest August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An August Wi-Fi Smart Lock being used to lock the door." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOhWdGMo9pQ0UU9fAFAzCeClcpY=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773450/August_Wi_Fi_Smart_Lock_Silver_trex5942_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dc1F4p"&gt;August’s latest Wi-Fi Smart Lock is on a special discount today through &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Faugust%2Dsmart%2Dlock%2Dwi%2Dfi%2D4th%2Dgen&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDailyDeal082521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;. This small, discreet smart lock is on sale in both black and gray colorways for $199, and you can use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE20&lt;/strong&gt; to take an additional $20 off the sale price while supplies last. This brings the Alexa-enabled August lock down to a new historic low price of $179, which is an exceptional deal for an app-connected smart lock that can be easily retrofitted to your existing deadbolt without the need for a locksmith. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255026/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WlwTdO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9758101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IU4NYr"&gt;Continuing our run of great smart home deals, the Eufy Wi-Fi Video Doorbell 2K is at its all-time low price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R3WY95C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This wired doorbell is great if you’re looking to step into the smart home waters without diving too deep into your wallet, as it does not need a monthly subscription of any kind. The Alexa-ready Eufy also records 2560 x 1920 resolution video and provides some basics that other companies often charge for, including notifications and prerecorded responses, rendering it a great entry-level device. It’s currently on sale for $110, but after you clip the on-page coupon, the price sinks to $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0pCPyF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10717224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1nxzXr"&gt;If you’re looking for a cheap tablet, Amazon’s recently released Fire HD 10 is available right now as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet-productivity-bundle/dp/B08XMBMW3H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a Bluetooth keyboard case and a 12-month subscription to Microsoft Office 365. This effectively gives you the keyboard case and Office 365 subscription for just $20 over what the ad-supported, 32GB base tablet would normally cost, regardless of which of the four colorways you choose. It’s not exactly a productivity powerhouse — for an inexpensive alternative, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;we suggest a Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; for most people — but it is a viable option if you want to stream movies or do some light work with Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, or Word. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NLj6la"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IDI0qd"&gt;In addition to being the pack-in controller for the Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox controllers have for years been the de facto standard for PC gaming thanks to native support in Windows 10. Thankfully, if you don’t have one or would like to pick up a second controller, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal082521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%2F8xn59crbsqgz%2FHG3Q" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft is selling&lt;/a&gt; the latest iteration of its wireless controller in carbon black for $10 off. For those that prefer splashes of color, Microsoft is also offering the vibrant “shock blue” and “pulse red” models, both of which are currently going for $5 off. In addition to support for Xbox consoles, these controllers support Bluetooth as well as wired connections via USB-C, and the hybrid D-pad is satisfyingly clicky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XmIxrT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are some must-have accessories for your Xbox Series X or Series S","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550830/xbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="E8tzb4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQjnQB"&gt;If you rank the visual performance of your video games over counting pixels, the LG UltraGear 27GN750-B might be the ideal display in this price range. With a 240Hz IPS panel and 1920 x 1080 resolution, not to mention 1ms response time and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, you can experience incredibly fast, smooth graphics that are devoid of distracting screen tearing. Luckily, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-27GN750-B-Compatibility-Adjustable/dp/B0841787BZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering&lt;/a&gt; a $123 discount on the 27-inch monitor today, dropping it to an all-time low of $277. Both PC and console gamers can jump in, too, as the monitor features dual HDMI ports to complement its DisplayPort connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhjqSq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10717207"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGgESu"&gt;Now if you are the type that believes the more pixels the merrier, the 2560 x 1440 resolution sibling to this monitor from LG is also on a great deal. You get many of the same features like 1ms response time, a similar port selection, and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility with just a small sacrifice of 144Hz refresh rate in exchange for that higher QHD pixel count — all for about $21 more on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-27GN750-B-Compatibility-Adjustable/dp/B08LLD2QXJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Sotqu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10429642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id="oltjNP"&gt;Amazon is offering discounts on a variety of its fast-charging GaN wall chargers, including a  single-port USB-C 30W charger in black for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087MFL8DM?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$17&lt;/a&gt; and a four-port USB-C / USB-A 100W charger in black for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087MDYP24?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Alphabet’s drone delivery service Wing hits 100,000 deliveries milestone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FZZndyEoAqxwUSc_29hcmDsVw9c=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773369/72699748_556579681764775_2732760482103427072_n.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Z6zwh"&gt;Wing, the drone delivery company operated by Google-parent Alphabet, is about to rack up 100,000 deliveries. The company says it will pass the threshold in the next few days, a significant milestone for a technology that has nevertheless yet to prove its utility at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLdnoz"&gt;Drone deliveries began to catch the public imagination in the early 2010s as consumer quadcopters fell in price and AI control systems became more reliable. Then, in 2013, Amazon made wild promises about making drones a standard part of its delivery empire. But so far the technology has mainly found success at a much smaller scale: delivering high-value but physically small items like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320965/drone-delivery-vaccine-ghana-zipline-cold-chain-storage"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11367274/zipline-drone-delivery-rwanda-medicine-blood"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; in remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcvDiq"&gt;Wing’s success, though, hints that one future for drone deliveries might lie in the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UmN4Co"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more than 50,000 Wing deliveries have been made in Logan, Australia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lZfpVt"&gt;Wing currently operates in three countries: Australia, the US, and Finland. Its biggest success has been in Logan, Australia: a suburb of Brisbane where more than 50,000 of its total deliveries have been carried out. Logan is home to around 300,000 residents, and Wing’s service is accessible to just over a third of this population. Users can download the Wing app and order a &lt;a href="https://wing.com/australia/logan/"&gt;small selection of goods&lt;/a&gt;, including coffee, groceries, sushi, cakes, pet food, and sportswear. Deliveries are generally made in under 10 minutes, and Wing’s record for a delivery is two minutes and 47 seconds from order to arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MalrvdN5EmZB0r6rr-9z-9w1KQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A fleet of Wing delivery drones perform autonomy tests first thing in the morning&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qU8dxk"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;via email, Wing spokesperson Jonathan Bass said Wing’s expansion in Logan shows that the company “can build a safe, scalable service that communities will embrace.” Said Bass: “There are hundreds of cities around the world just like Logan in terms of size: New Orleans, USA; Manchester, England or Florence, Italy, just to name a few.” He noted that more than 2 billion people live in cities with populations of 500,000 or fewer, though he also added that Wing has ambitions to operate in larger cities, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf5YmF"&gt;Part of the reason for Wing’s success seems to be the specifics of its design. Wing’s drones can operate as both fixed-wing aircraft and hovering copters. Unlike Amazon’s delivery drones, the aircraft also don’t need to land to drop off goods. Wing’s craft fly to their location, descend to a height of seven meters (23 feet), and then lower their packages on a tether, automatically releasing them onto the ground. A recent report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;about Amazon’s struggling delivery drone program&lt;/a&gt; in the UK identified the need for the company’s drones to physically land on the ground as a major engineering challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/El0e3MCquXDXiN4v9P_iZQqRy2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804325/120200849_809350503154357_8323104168818065800_n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing’s drones lower their packages down to the ground on a tether. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KgQRVp"&gt;All drone delivery methods, though, limit the technology’s customer base. In densely populated urban areas, customers are unlikely to be able to locate a suitable delivery location at their house. Wing users, for example, need to find “small areas without overhanging trees, power lines or other obstacles, typically in the front yard, backyard or driveway” to receive a delivery, says Bass. These are in short supply for many city residents, including those of Florence, Italy — one of the locations Bass himself mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO4s70"&gt;It’s also not clear if the economics of drone deliveries will make sense at a larger scale. Bass says he’s “extremely bullish” about the potential profitability of Wing, and that drone delivery is “significantly less expensive to scale than existing ground-based delivery methods,” but such claims need to be proven through growth and profits. For the moment, drone delivery is still a fledgling technology, but it might be growing up soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Gamescom’s Opening Night Live stream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnSWQxhGU7UrqV95SerBsDzu2fc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773389/Vanguard_Reveal_04.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0SdeJU"&gt;Gamescom is usually the biggest in-person video games conference, but it’s happening virtually for the second year straight due to the pandemic. That may be disappointing to people who wanted to go to Cologne, Germany, but the online presentation makes it a lot easier for viewers at home to see all of the highlights. Geoff Keighley’s two-hour-long Opening Night Live event is focused on doing just that, providing new Gamescom game announcements, trailers, and guest appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALaRF6"&gt;As for what you can expect, Keighley promises a walkthrough of a full level from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631315/call-of-duty-vanguard-release-date-trailer-sledgehammer-ps5-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s campaign playing on the latest consoles; some big news about &lt;em&gt;Splitgate&lt;/em&gt;, the portal-based competitive FPS title that’s been popular lately; an update on &lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&lt;/em&gt;; an unveiling of the next &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt;; along with some other surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k39uxX"&gt;What time does Opening Night Live begin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F9XpdM"&gt;For some people, Opening Night Live won’t actually be taking place at night. It starts at 2PM ET / 11AM PT / 7PM BST, so you can tune in during a midday work break (your boss won’t notice that you’re gone for two hours, right?), or right after work, depending on where you are in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAJ0u6"&gt;Where can I watch Opening Night Live?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o1I5N5"&gt;This event, like many other game event streams, is available to watch on multiple sites, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lqD2vHSyzo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (embedded above), &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1413136045537853441"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards/videos/4701579209854910"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10WcI1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Rogan, confined to Spotify, is losing influence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b83oin-gTmGN_z69My3vW14VzAM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773233/acastro_210824_4719_rogan_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge | Photo by Vivian Zink/NBCUniversal via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A Verge investigation shows how going exclusive stunted Rogan’s power&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fR8dNl"&gt;When Spotify decided to try to become the biggest podcasting platform in the world, it knew it needed a nuclear weapon: Joe Rogan. The comedian turned podcasting icon has become impossible to miss and a force in the industry. He’s hosted legitimate politicians like Bernie Sanders and wannabes like Kanye West, smoked a joint with Elon Musk, and schmoozed with huge celebrities like Dave Chappelle and Miley Cyrus. With a self-asserted reach of more than 200 million monthly downloads in 2019, Rogan is one of the biggest — if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; biggest — podcaster in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUBwXU"&gt;Spotify hoped he would bring much of that audience along with him when he signed exclusively to the platform in 2020 in a reported $100 million deal, giving it the reach and power needed to take over the podcasting industry. Although Spotify hasn’t given specific numbers detailing Rogan’s listenership since he came on board, it has repeatedly boasted about his success. The company confirmed that he quickly became the platform’s biggest podcaster after jumping to Spotify. He “stimulated new user additions, activated first time podcast listeners, and [has] driven favorable engagement trends, including vodcast consumption,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Shareholder-Letter-Q4-2020_FINAL.pdf"&gt;a February 2021&lt;/a&gt; earnings release. &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Shareholder-Letter-Q1-2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;In April&lt;/a&gt;, it said Rogan’s show had “performed above expectations” in regards to adding new users to the platform and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3Md42"&gt;However, a new data investigation by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; finds that the powerful podcaster’s influence has waned since he went behind Spotify’s wall. His show has declined as a hype vehicle for guests, and Rogan’s presence as a mainstay in the news has plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQLyHc"&gt;Because Spotify doesn’t share how many plays each podcast gets, or how many unique listeners regularly tune in, we looked instead at a secondary metric: how much of a promotional boost Rogan gives his guests. To do this, we pulled data from the analytics tool Social Blade to track the Twitter following of every guest who went on Rogan’s podcast between December 2019 and July 2021. Guests generally see a surge of new followers after appearing on the show, with some gaining as many as 18,000 new followers in the week following their chat, and that effect has grown over time as &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; gained popularity. While we can’t attribute every new follower to Rogan — guests might have been on a media tour to promote a new movie or book, for instance — the bump after a Rogan appearance is constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jK8HCn"&gt;We found that prior to going exclusive, from December 2019 to November 2020, Rogan’s guests could expect to gain around 4,000 Twitter followers in the week after their episode premiered. After he went exclusive, that number declined by half to around 2,000, suggesting a drop in listeners. To isolate the effect, we focused on people who had under 500,000 followers when going on Rogan’s show, since bigger names — someone like Dave Chappelle or Elon Musk — were likely to bring more attention to Rogan than vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="t5hLjF"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-01" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7041546/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7041546/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7041546" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hx8Bqv"&gt;You can see the totality of our findings below. We plotted the average number of followers gained month by month. The drop doesn’t look monumental, due to the presence of a couple outlier months, but broadly, you can see that following Rogan’s move to going exclusive, his guests gain fewer followers on average. Even the best months as a Spotify exclusive show only rival the worst months when his show was widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="EzxsMQ"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7041938/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7041938/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7041938" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ijEVu8"&gt;We attempted to look into this for Instagram, as well, but Social Blade only had data on about half of the guests — not enough to create a complete picture of the trends. (Still, we saw that the number of followers gained on Instagram declined significantly for those available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucX9IT"&gt;There could be various explanations for the monthslong dip. People might be listening to fewer podcasts post-pandemic, or Rogan fans could have coincidentally stopped using Twitter. But the timing of the dip still aligns with his switch to Spotify exclusivity, suggesting Rogan has lost dedicated listeners. Presumably, the people who took action after an episode and actually followed guests were his most engaged. Now there’s likely fewer of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzocMA"&gt;You can see the same story play out in more detail when looking at guests who were on the show multiple times. Comedian Andrew Santino, who has been on Rogan’s show nine times over the years, appeared twice in 2019, once in 2020, and then once in 2021. Those first two appearances in 2019 netted him over 1,100 followers each. That gain jumped to nearly 1,700 followers in 2020. But in 2021, when Rogan was exclusive to Spotify, the number of followers he added dropped by almost half, to under 900. (For comparison, in the week before he went on Rogan in 2020, Santino gained 1,173 followers on his own, so Rogan gave him a bump of 500 more followers the week after. In April 2021, he gained 772 followers the week before his appearance — Rogan only gave him a bump of 116 people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaxbIs"&gt;We can see a similar trajectory play out with three other guests. Comedian Annie Lederman saw a drop of nearly 50 percent on her most recent guest appearance, as did podcaster and author Michael Malice. Comedian Mark Normand did, too, with a drop of over 50 percent from his latest appearance in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="aQ9iEf"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7042063/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7042063/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7042063" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyz2PD"&gt;Despite likely losing listeners in his switch over to Spotify, Rogan’s show still appears to be reaching more people than it did in prior years. Podcaster Bret Weinstein, for example, went on the show in February 2018, June 2020, and June 2021. He gained around 22,000 followers in June 2020, a significant jump over the 4,000 or so he gained in 2018. In June 2021, he gained 18,000, which is still a drop but not as significant as the ones we see in January or April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nL4iLR"&gt;Rogan’s reach could be dipping for a number of reasons. The show used to benefit from posting full episodes to YouTube, which usually received millions of views each and often led to snippets going viral on other platforms, like Twitter. But the YouTube channel now just hosts clips, which don’t always break the million-view milestone. Rogan also used to have visibility in other podcasting apps, which is important because not everyone uses Spotify. It’s possible that social media algorithms, and YouTube’s in particular, also helped Rogan and his guests gain a following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dgw8za"&gt;Spotify declined to comment on this report or offer any sort of numbers around Rogan’s performance. Rogan’s team did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8sfb6"&gt;But this lack of reach is also having an effect on Rogan’s broader relevance. Google Trends data shows that searches for his name spiked regularly in 2020 with interest remaining relatively high throughout the year. As soon as he went exclusive, however, those searches dipped. This could be because people used to search Rogan’s name to find his episodes, but it could also be that inside Spotify, his controversial comments — often the cause of spikes in interest around Rogan — aren’t reaching as many ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="PRzVWE"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7042161/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7042161/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7042161" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktbOpX"&gt;In 2021, spikes of interest around Rogan are much fewer and farther between. One of the biggest occurred in April when he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"&gt;discouraged young adults&lt;/a&gt; from getting the COVID-19 vaccine, which speaks to the importance these controversial moments have on Rogan’s reach and ability to drum up broader interest. While these controversies boost his relevance, they often put Spotify in a position of having to defend its star talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1tVa7"&gt;We can see this play out on Rogan’s YouTube channel, too. When he would post entire episodes to his YouTube page, Rogan averaged around 265,000 subscribers per month in the year before going exclusive, according to Social Blade data. After he went exclusive in December 2020, that dropped to around 100,000 a month. This shows how going exclusive limits the reach and potential impact of these shows’ stars. (For reference, YouTube’s biggest stars, like Pewdiepie, grew by millions of subscribers per month, despite having tens of millions more subscribers than Rogan, so Rogan likely would have continued growing at a faster clip had he continued posting full episodes to the platform.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="3wk3fU"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="rogan-viz-02" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/7042247/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"&gt;&lt;a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7042247/?utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/7042247" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"&gt;&lt;img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803419/made_with_flourish_right_align.png" class="flourish-bug"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNHLJ4"&gt;Meanwhile, many of Rogan’s fans haven’t been happy about the exclusive change. When &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; transitioned from something people could find on most any podcast app — other than Spotify — and YouTube, to a show only available on Spotify, people got confused, upset, and claimed to drop off as listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HXn7h"&gt;“For the past three years, listening to JRE was my healing ritual which made me relax and amused any time I felt tired and hopeless, the only sane voice I could listen to without any ulterior motives of the corporate media (I even began using Youtube Premium just to listen to JRE undisturbed by ads),” one person &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/k59r6m/the_day_jre_was_taken_away_from_me/"&gt;wrote on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020, saying Spotify isn’t available in their country, but YouTube is. “Now I have to search around for illegal downloads and cope with what’s left on the Youtube Channel, which might get removed in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31CEvV"&gt;Another person said they tune in less now that it’s on Spotify. “I’m not sure what it is, maybe YouTube just feels more open and intuitive, but I find myself listening WAY less,” they wrote &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/kfotxa/anybody_else_tuning_into_jre_less_even_with/"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. “I just haven’t been able to do that as much with Spotify. Maybe it’s the missing comment section? Maybe it’s a me problem?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0A2EW"&gt;Taken altogether, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s data findings suggest that Rogan has lost impact and relevance since going exclusive to Spotify. A sizable portion of his audience likely didn’t follow him when he made the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WhUF4h"&gt;Even still, Spotify has continued to secure exclusive deals with big names. Most recently, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534981/spotify-exclusive-podcast-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Alex Cooper of &lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;Dax Shepard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;, both of whom, if Rogan is any indicator, will likely see a drop in their listener base. For Spotify, however, the deals might be worth the tradeoff if people migrate to its app and it sells ads against these programs. For the podcasters who are receiving multimillion-dollar deals, the money exchanged might be enough to make up for lagging relevancy. At least until their contracts run out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Otter.ai can transcribe Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Cisco Webex meetings if you’re not there</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wy9PxfZDFZGxVUYeoFfKcTmbrWY=/30x0:1250x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773076/1._Otter.ai.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otter.ai is available on iOS, Android, and via the web. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Otter.ai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NN2LRh"&gt;Otter.ai is one of our favorite transcription tools thanks to the accuracy of its machine learning-generated notes. If you’re a paying user, you can also use its Otter Assistant feature to plug into your calendar and automatically join and transcribe meetings even if you’re not there. Previously, Otter Assistant only worked with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;Zoom meetings&lt;/a&gt;, but today the company is expanding it to integrate with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Cisco Webex meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm8uWF"&gt;It’s a handy feature, depending on the platform (or platforms) on which you tend to have meetings. Zoom already offers &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004794983-Using-audio-transcription-for-cloud-recordings-"&gt;third-party transcription features&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while Teams has its own &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/view-live-transcription-in-a-teams-meeting-dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b"&gt;built-in free transcription tool&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re already using one of these services, then the expansion of Otter Assistant won’t mean much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGVFUo"&gt;However, if you’re having meetings across lots of platforms and are already signed up to Otter.ai, then the Assistant tool is a handy way to keep all your notes in one place. Like Microsoft Team’s transcription tool, the notes it generates are also available to view live, letting you search the transcription even while the meeting is still in progress. It does cost, though, and requires an Otter Business plan. That costs &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fotter.ai%2Fpricing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F25%2F22639148%2Fotter-ai-meeting-transcription-assistant-google-meet-microsoft-teams-cisco-webex" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 a month&lt;/a&gt; and gets you access to a bunch of other features including custom vocabulary, audio imports, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Popular online businesses are opening storefronts thanks to TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A78t4ClyQe7_X2SDba_wzeKBcfE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773090/VRG_ILLO_4687_TikTok_IRL_Stores.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Viral fame, IRL customers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Ss2ETL"&gt;On March 15th, 2020, Ashley Breest and her then-fiancé, Gautier Coiffard, soft-launched their bakery to Breest’s coworkers at a mortgage company. One taste of their loaves of bread, baked by Coiffard in their Brooklyn apartment, and Breest’s colleagues were eagerly placing orders for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTepod"&gt;“And then I never saw them again,” Breest says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV2ErG"&gt;After the pandemic shut down their initial plans, Breest and Coiffard took another approach: they brought the business online, where their bakery, &lt;a href="https://lappartement4f.com/"&gt;L’Appartement 4F&lt;/a&gt;, ended up rapidly gaining a following of New Yorkers who not only allowed the business to flourish as a delivery service, but will now be first in line when the pair open their storefront in Brooklyn Heights this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ONRz7L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pandemic-born small businesses are hoping to translate their online followings to IRL shoppers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zM4UVe"&gt;The coronavirus pandemic shut down the dreams of many budding small businesses, who had to either abandon ship or find a way to pivot to a new digital-only world. Now, with the country opened up and a large swath of empty storefronts waiting, pandemic-born small businesses are hoping to translate their online followings to IRL shoppers. Many say those followings have given them a necessary boost to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqktEn"&gt;In the bakery’s first week, Breest and Coiffard received enough digital foot traffic from their now &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lappartement4f/"&gt;10,000 Instagram followers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lappartement4f?"&gt;34,000 TikTok followers&lt;/a&gt; to buy a dishwasher for their apartment (you guessed it — 4F). Over the next year, their storefront dreams were successfully funded through Kickstarter. Ninety-nine percent of that money, the pair say, came straight from the wallets of their social media followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="6f8kOQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@lappartement4f/video/6979234451721080069" data-video-id="6979234451721080069" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@lappartement4f" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lappartement4f"&gt;@lappartement4f&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;         bonjour besties, thank you so much for all of the support you guys have given us on Tik tok… our Kickstarter launched today   &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - L’Appartement 4F" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6979234351938587398"&gt;♬ original sound - L’Appartement 4F&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OUxi20"&gt;While followers won’t be able to visit L’Appartement 4F in person until its opening later this year, Breest and Coiffard need only look across the Manhattan Bridge to see what’s to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MZFpT"&gt;“We had a line down the block for a good part of the morning, I would say for like two and a half, three hours,” Emma Rogue, the owner of Manhattan vintage and thrift store Rogue, which opened in June of this year, tells me in a phone call. Her store — the &lt;a href="https://embedded.substack.com/p/emma-rogue-arrives-on-nycs-tiktok"&gt;second TikToker-owned business&lt;/a&gt; to land on Stanton Street in the Lower East Side — began as a Depop store which Rogue &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emma.rogue"&gt;promoted on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic prevented her from selling at street fairs and pop-ups.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzB84z"&gt;With around 414,000 TikTok followers, Rogue now uses her account as a space to primarily promote her storefront, and says her online audience is responsible for most of her in-person business.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="50z8QC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘How did you find out about the shop?’ I would say 95 percent say TikTok.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H893yv"&gt;“Whenever people come in, I ask, ‘How did you find out about the shop?’ I would say 95 percent say TikTok,” she says. “A few have said Instagram, some have even said Snapchat because I got a feature on this NBC Snapchat show. It aired and then a girl came in, not even an hour later, and she was like, ‘Oh yeah, I just saw it on Snap.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4rPub"&gt;In fact, activity around &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bizarrecoffee/"&gt;a TikTok account&lt;/a&gt; is surprisingly way more likely to translate into in-person foot traffic than it ever does online orders — at least in the experience of Sabrina Kaylor of Bizarre Coffee in Canton, Georgia. She thinks people are just eager to do things in person again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ367F"&gt;Kaylor, who has a background as an artist and a coffee roaster, began selling specialty beans online and at farmers markets last summer. Between then and opening up her shop in December, Kaylor made coffee-making videos and tutorials on TikTok, earning over 19,000 followers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVB60i"&gt;“After we had a video that did really well, I mean, it was pretty immediate,” Kaylor tells me on the phone. “At least one to two people a day are coming in ordering things that I’ve only posted on TikTok.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYMDPI"&gt;Kaylor credits TikTok’s algorithm for putting her business in front of local eyeballs, but says its online popularity has also brought in people from out of state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“People have made trips, taking time out of their day, to work our tiny 380-square-foot coffee shop into their road trip.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building a business off social media does come with challenges. Whenever Rogue is planning a new launch or pop-up for the shop, its success is in the “hands of the algorithm.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Every video I create is good content, but whether it goes viral or not is another question,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TQFI6"&gt;Rachel Parker, the owner of clothing boutique &lt;a href="https://www.littleladybaby.com/"&gt;Little Lady Baby&lt;/a&gt; in Newport, Rhode Island, is adapting in a different way. While online success on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/little.lady.baby/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@littleladybaby_?"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; allowed her to open the store in October, most of her following is spread across America and can’t make it to Rhode Island. So she’s coming to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RbIiX"&gt;“People are really invested in the camper,” she says. Her 1,500 TikTok followers have been watching Parker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@littleladybaby_/video/6989401224109968645"&gt;restore and decorate a used campervan&lt;/a&gt;, which she plans to take on the road as a mobile version of Little Lady Baby. “I hope to one day travel with it so I can connect with people [I met on] TikTok.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4StO5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every video I create is good content, but whether it goes viral or not is another question”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2DVjRw"&gt;L’Appartement 4F’s storefront situation is a little different from the norm, and could signal a shift in how business is being done in the 2020s. Real estate agents were approaching them, not vice versa, due to their social following. It was the Brooklyn Heights Association, however, that saw the bakery on Instagram and decided to take Breest and Coiffard under its wing. After the results of a survey revealed Brooklyn Heights residents were hankering for a bakery, the neighborhood association showed L’Appartement 4F a number of storefronts on Montague Street before landing on 115.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s5hVMb"&gt;“I think it’s great to see if we can be kind of a pilot for these businesses that build themselves through social media and then are able to open an actual brick-and-mortar,” Lara Birnback, executive director of the BHA, tells me over the phone. “It’s pretty exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The company behind PUBG is trying to create the next big fantasy epic</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqjkhMAkNe_W0RtmQbFpGXVRcuo=/60x0:1860x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773107/KAGAN_DRACA_______________.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Project Windless” concept art. | Image: Krafton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Krafton’s ‘Project Windless’ is still in its earliest stages&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="CFAVQh"&gt;Krafton is best known as the company behind &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, taking the scrappy battle royale and turning it into something much bigger thanks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22297267/pubg-new-state-battle-royale-game-android-ios-2021"&gt;to mobile versions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubg-universe.com/"&gt;surprisingly expansive lore&lt;/a&gt;, and soon even &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2020/12/16/22178915/callisto-protocol-striking-distance-glen-schofield-interview-dead-space-sci-fi-horror-pubg"&gt;a horror spinoff&lt;/a&gt;. Now the company is hoping to build the next big fantasy series after licensing the Korean novel &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bird_That_Drinks_Tears"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bird That Drinks Tears&lt;/em&gt; by Lee Yeong-do&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of creating a multimedia franchise that extends to games and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0xo98"&gt;“Project Windless,” as it’s known right now, is still in its earliest stages. Krafton art director Kwang Jae Son and renowned concept artist Iain McCaig — who has worked on the likes of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; — are currently creating what’s described as a “visual bible” for the series. “It’s basically groundwork to first bring the book to life,” Son explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPzmXC"&gt;McCaig tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he was initially referred to the project by a friend in Korea. But once he looked into the book, he was so excited he set aside a number of personal projects to focus on it. “&lt;em&gt;The Bird That Drinks Tears&lt;/em&gt; is unlike any other fantasy story I have ever read, with fresh new ways of exploring human nature, which is what always attracts me most,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A64swX"&gt;According to Son, part of what makes the book different from other fantasy series like &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; is its focus on Korean folklore. Here’s his description of the work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EsItTP"&gt;The biggest charm of [Lee Yeong-do]’s works, especially &lt;em&gt;The Bird That Drinks Tears&lt;/em&gt;, is that everything is novel. There are races where chickens and snakes are humanized, not to mention monsters from Korean folklore. Lee Yeong-do’s stories introduce a diverse element of novelty and each element organically interacts to create a unique world. It is difficult to visualize all these elements, but I am always mesmerized by the originality of the world he created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vciKUJ"&gt;The beauty of this world is that it tells stories with contradictions and paradoxes. The greatest beings leave their ugliest traces, and those that you truly loved betray you. These extreme pieces of the story throw questions to the readers, which makes the book’s themes more resonant and personal. It’s quite philosophical and can be analyzed and interpreted in a variety of ways. You could find that these elements make the novel challenging, but I think that that’s what make it even greater. Depending on the values a reader holds, the theme constantly changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NC4swd"&gt;According to McCaig, the process of visualizing the novel is similar to work he’s done in the past. “I always look for through-lines — things that connect and run throughout the entire saga — and visual themes that we can build upon and pay off later, too,” he says. “It’s part detective work, part archaeology, part treasure hunt.” The visual bible is still being worked on, and the duo expect to complete it by the end of the year. “The visual bible for &lt;em&gt;The Bird That Drinks Tears &lt;/em&gt;will be provided to various artists, writers, and directors who will expand this work, so we are concentrating on building the world based on the story, character, and understanding of the original novel,” says Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdnNp1"&gt;You can get a sense of the style in the concept art below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fBepK3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10716612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LoXW9w"&gt;“Project Windless” fits snugly into Krafton’s stated plans to expand beyond video games. The company even recently announced an animated &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; project helmed by Adi Shankar. But “Project Windless” is something much more ambitious. &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; grew as a franchise solely because the original game was such a big hit. All of the subsequent releases — whether game or something else — grew from that. This new project goes in a different direction, with the expectation that it will be a media-spanning series from the very beginning. That’s new territory for Krafton, and Son says the company is looking at other successful fantasy series for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sN3bhY"&gt;“Interestingly, the &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; video game series was based on the original novels, but ironically the original novel became better known to the world thanks to the game. And since then, the IP has been produced as a series and has grown into a global IP loved by many. In this respect, T&lt;em&gt;he Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is a good role model for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s new Charge 5 has a rounded design and a color screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zjiWk3dFdz7gk5DnZqTfQnUKl4c=/157x0:1843x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773082/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Lunar_White_HR.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit’s new Charge 5 in gold.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Fitbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It costs $179.95 and will be out this fall&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5EUZU7"&gt;Following a couple of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626752/fitbit-charge-5-leaked-images-specs-news"&gt;big&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638452/fitbit-charge-5-leak-features-premium-fitness-tracker"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit is officially announcing the Charge 5, the company’s latest fitness tracker, and it marks one of the biggest design changes to the popular Charge family since the first Charge HR, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7077065/fitbit-announces-surge-fitness-superwatch-and-two-new-fitness-bands"&gt;which came out in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The Charge 5 shaves down the hard angles that have defined the Charge trackers for a more rounded look, and more significantly, it’s the first Charge with a color AMOLED display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szVDot"&gt;The Charge 5’s screen is 10 percent larger than the Charge 4’s, and can get up to 450 nits bright, up from the Charge 4’s 200 nits. That all means that the screen should be easier to see when you’re outside. And you can also opt to have the display on at all times — which means you won’t have to wait for the screen to light up just to see the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cL6Z31dWyoNl0IK4SvVoBNPVido=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804172/Fitbit_Charge_5_Render_3QTR_Core_Black_Graphite__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit’s Charge 5 in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jV-q0_-yamvIlZmJeblMrbh1o9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804026/Fitbit_Charge_5_Render_3QTR_Core_Steel_Blue_Platinum_Cardio.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And in silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuqRRh"&gt;Fans of the previous monochrome screen might balk at the change. And I say that as someone who really likes the monochrome on the Charge 4 — it’s nice not having yet another colorful screen to distract me. But I could see how a color screen could make it easier to differentiate between stats and information, which could make the Charge 5 that much more glanceable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk1cEd"&gt;And while the always-on display could also be quite useful, it comes at a significant cost of battery. While Fitbit advertises up-to-seven-day battery life with the Charge 5, that’s with the always-on display turned off. Turning it on cuts that down to just two — much closer to what you might be used to with a more traditional smartwatch than the Charge 5 resembles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDFTFu"&gt;I’m a big fan of the Charge 5’s more rounded look. Gone are many of the hard angles, edges, and geometric shapes of the previous Charge trackers — everything on the Charge 5 looks smoother than it did before. (Though I do wish the Charge 5’s band kept the criss-crossed lines that stand out on the band for the Charge 2, 3, and 4.) The Charge 5 is 10 percent thinner than the Charge 4, meaning it shouldn’t jut out quite as much from your wrist, and I really like the way the sensors on the back of the Charge 5 look to blend in more seamlessly than they do on the Charge 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9ZfsrfqkoZBNw2YfhnX_PRizMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803854/Fitbit_Charge_5_DesignStory_EvolutionSlide_Final.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Charge 4 (left) next to the Charge 5 (right). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FUQi8L"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22386394/fitbit-luxe-fitness-wellness-tracker-price-release-date-features"&gt;recently-released Fitbit Luxe&lt;/a&gt;, the Charge 5 also has a buttonless design, meaning you’ll interact with the device entirely from the touch screen. (Technically, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17984764/fitbit-charge-3-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-notifications"&gt;Charge 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;Charge 4&lt;/a&gt; didn’t have buttons either, but there was a small indent on the side of those trackers with a capacitive ridge that you could push to wake up the device and feel a little haptic feedback.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY7A6a"&gt;The silver rails on the side of the Charge 5 might &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like buttons, but they’re actually sensors that let you take electrocardiogram (ECG) readings to check for signs of atrial fibrillation (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Ftechnology%2Fecg&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F25%2F22640462%2Ffitbit-charge-5-rounded-design-color-screen-daily-readiness-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is only available in some countries&lt;/a&gt;) and electrodermal activity (EDA) readings to check your body’s response to stress. Both features are also found on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Sense smartwatch line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjCF9Tb6IVXkzKSGhSY1_Dcymdw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803865/Fitbit_Charge_5_EXPLODED_R9_v05_jw_EXPLODED.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deconstructed image of the Charge 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aP95nL"&gt;Like many other Fitbit devices, the Charge 5 has a host of other health tracking features, like monitoring your heartbeat, your sleep, and your oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels. Fitbit is also announcing a new “Daily Readiness Score” alongside the Charge 5, which seems similar to what’s offered by &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-weird-wearable-is-keeping-me-fit-and-rested-during-1842983271"&gt;the Whoop wristband&lt;/a&gt;. The Daily Readiness Score suggests different levels of exercise based on your recent activity, sleep, and heart rate variability to make sure that you’re recovering effectively. If your score is higher, Fitbit will recommend more intense activities, but if it’s lower, Fitbit will recommend a lighter workout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgczkS"&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fservices%2Fpremium&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F25%2F22640462%2Ffitbit-charge-5-rounded-design-color-screen-daily-readiness-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, who pay $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year, will be able to get a Daily Readiness Score, though the Charge 5 will come with a courtesy six-month subscription to the service if you want to try it out. And it’s not a feature that’s exclusive to the Charge 5; the Fitbit Sense, Versa 3, Versa 2, Luxe, and Inspire 2 will also be able to give you a Daily Readiness Score when the feature is available this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOkTIX"&gt;Like with the Charge 4, the Charge 5 lets you use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21078968/how-to-set-up-fitbit-pay-credit-debit-card-versa-ionic-charge-3"&gt;Fitbit Pay&lt;/a&gt; to pay for things with just your Charge 5. You’ll also be able to see notifications on your Charge 5 and reply to notifications from certain apps with quick replies if your Fitbit is paired with an Android device. The Charge 5 can take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/31/16584442/fast-pair-android-easy-simple-bluetooth-pairing"&gt;Google Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt; for speedier setup with an Android device, but the tracker will still work with iOS, despite the fact that Google completed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22188428/google-fitbit-acquisition-completed-approved"&gt;its acquisition of Fitbit in January&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD6ZkP"&gt;The Charge family has been very successful so far — the company has sold more than 40 million Charges to date, and Fitbit claims one out of every three Fitbit users today wear a Charge fitness tracker. Over time, Fitbit has steadily added features to the Charge line that make them more competitive with smartwatches, such as the much larger screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/29/12666722/fitbit-charge-2-fitness-tracker-heart-rate-gps-breathe-meditation"&gt;added to the Charge 2&lt;/a&gt;, a touch screen and water resistance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17984764/fitbit-charge-3-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-notifications"&gt;in the Charge 3&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;built-in GPS with the Charge 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ohnyLHob5_eNGaRz1t-_MFmjAKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804018/Fitbit_Charge_comparison_chart_The_Verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chart from Fitbit comparing different features across the Charge line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="krywaB"&gt;But the new features and design on the Charge 5 come at an increased cost. The Charge 5, which comes in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;black, silver, and gold color variants, costs $179.95, a $30 jump from the Charge 4. And if you bought bands for the Charge 3 or 4, those won’t be compatible with the 5, which means you’ll have to spend even more to outfit the device with your preferred band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sytc77"&gt;The new features and higher cost might also make it harder to pick between a fitness tracker or a smartwatch. For $100 more, it could be worth picking up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;an Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, which offers many of the same health tracking features as a Charge 5 (though no SpO2 tracking), a bigger screen, and much better integration for iPhone users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXt6Ug"&gt;If you’ve got a Samsung phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;the new 40mm Galaxy Watch 4 is a compelling option&lt;/a&gt;, and at $250, it’s even cheaper than the Apple Watch SE. If you want to stay in the Fitbit world, there’s the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fsmartwatches%2Fversa3%3Fsku%3D511BKBK&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F25%2F22640462%2Ffitbit-charge-5-rounded-design-color-screen-daily-readiness-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$230 Versa 3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;the Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for $250 on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitbit.com%2Fglobal%2Fus%2Fproducts%2Fsmartwatches%2Fsense%3Fsku%3D512SRSG&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F25%2F22640462%2Ffitbit-charge-5-rounded-design-color-screen-daily-readiness-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Smartwatch-Management-Temperature/dp/B08DFLG5SP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as I write this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuN1hy"&gt;The Charge 5 seems like it could be a good upgrade to the Charge line, with its color screen, the option of an always-on display, and new rounded design. But one of the benefits of focused fitness trackers versus smartwatches has been that they’re often the cheaper device. And while the Charge 5 is still more affordable than most smartwatches, the price difference isn’t as big as it has been before. Before picking up the Charge 5, you might want to consider whether the extra features in a smartwatch are worth the extra cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ENkIxZ"&gt;Preorders for the Charge 5 begin Wednesday ahead of availability this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXb3V3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans says never mind, it actually won’t ban porn on October 1st</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="id__kfx84vcphj"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773"&gt;abrupt tweet&lt;/a&gt;, video and image sharing site OnlyFans announced a reversal of the shocker announcement that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;ban sexually explicit content&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement to The Verge, a spokesperson said “The proposed October 1st, 2021 changes are no longer required due to banking partners’ assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBxSXO"&gt;This comes just one day after its CEO said, in an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks"&gt;the reason for the ban was actually issues with its banking partners&lt;/a&gt;, not Mastercard as some had assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Llvs2X"&gt;Now OnlyFans creators, many of whom had already begun deleting content that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634785/onlyfans-new-terms-of-service-policy-banning-sex-masturbation"&gt;violated the policy&lt;/a&gt; or started shifting their subscriber base to new platforms, are faced with a choice. They can either stick with a partner that grew to bring in billions by hosting content made by sex workers, or ditch the partner that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638310/onlyfans-ban-explicit-content-payment-processing-visa"&gt;looked like it sold them out when things got tough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vmLJDb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An official communication to creators will be emailed shortly.&lt;/p&gt;— OnlyFans (@OnlyFans) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499278829592578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is launching on December 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHW7uueNptPUheLIDUqp9Sep3fE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773043/halo_infinites_grappleshot_opens_up_the_game_in_a_major_way.original.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozR7ki"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, the next game in Microsoft’s long-running franchise, will launch on December 8th. The date &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ALumia_Italia/status/1430417735704629254"&gt;appeared on the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; today and will likely be officially confirmed later today during the opening of Gamescom. A source familiar with Microsoft’s plans tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that December 8th is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdLcGG"&gt;Microsoft had originally planned to launch &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; alongside the Xbox Series X / S in November 2020 but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;delayed the game&lt;/a&gt; to fall 2021 due in part to the challenges of game development during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeW9NB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s development has clearly been bumpy, and Microsoft even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403687/halo-infinite-bungie-joe-staten-returns-campaign"&gt;assigned Bungie veteran Joseph Staten&lt;/a&gt; to head up development of the game nearly a year ago. While we haven’t seen a great deal of campaign gameplay since the infamous Craig meme was born last year, the first multiplayer technical preview looked and felt just like the &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;that fans will enjoy playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPgmkP"&gt;The official launch date comes just days after 343 Industries revealed &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634448/halo-infinite-co-op-campaign-forge-delay-launch"&gt;won’t launch with campaign co-op and Forge&lt;/a&gt;. Cooperative play with friends should arrive in season two of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, approximately three months after launch. The Forge mode, that allows &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; players to customize and share maps, won’t arrive until season two of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, around six months after launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvy6Xy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign co-op and Forge mode are popular parts of the franchise, so the news understandably disappointed fans. But the main &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign and multiplayer mode is launching on December 8th, so fans will get a taste of new &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;in less than four months.&lt;/p&gt;
