    <title>Apple’s latest iOS and macOS betas undo some of Safari’s controversial new design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ex3ewRdUIaBcOxNm-UnH4abg61M=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582867/safari.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hy5JjJ"&gt;Apple has released its third developer betas for the upcoming iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, and they bring some much-needed fixes to Safari — namely, undoing some of the more controversial changes introduced in the earlier betas. For macOS, that means a normal tab bar that goes back to the previous design, while iOS is getting a more consistent design when it comes to the URL bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJjTt2"&gt;iOS 15 is still sticking with its new tab view and the moved URL bar on the bottom of the display, but the latest beta docked it there permanently, instead of bouncing it to the top of the screen when you selected it. Apple’s also added a new refresh option to the pop-over menu when you tap and hold the URL bar. Together, the changes help make the new design a lot more cohesive to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SkcnTe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As expected, Apple is continuing to tweak the design of Safari in iOS 15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In beta 3, the address bar is now docked above the keyboard. There is a new search UI and support for quick website searches too. Getting better! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tm562Djr0i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Tm562Djr0i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1415368283793109000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B1Xser"&gt;The change to macOS is simpler: Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-beta-3-brings-redesigned-safari-tab-interface-to-address-complaints/"&gt;seems to have just brought back&lt;/a&gt; part of its Big Sur design for Safari’s URL bar and tabs, ditching the combined tab/URL bar setup that it debuted in the earlier betas. In the latest beta, there’s once again a URL bar that lives at the top of each Safari menu, with a row of tabs beneath it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEwSEr"&gt;Each of those tabs still takes up a decently large piece of real estate — the overall Monterey design is the same in that regard — but it’s definitely an improvement over the original betas. That said, if you preferred the new design, that’s still an option too, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/revert-safari-redesign-macos-monterey-beta-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI0lCV"&gt;Unchanged, at least for now, is the iPadOS version of Safari. Given that Apple isn’t expected to fully release its latest OS updates until the fall, though, there’s still plenty of time for additional changes to Safari across all of Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAShaI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The company that graded the million-dollar copy of Super Mario 64 has a new owner</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/liP0fFxQs8wmDB-2t1HX10Q3VAg=/0x15:955x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582825/screenshot01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NNUkci"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.watagames.com/"&gt;Wata Games&lt;/a&gt;, the company that graded the recent record-breaking copies of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572688/super-mario-64-most-expensive-video-game-ever-heritage-auctions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has been acquired by &lt;a href="https://www.collectorsuniverse.com/"&gt;Collectors Universe&lt;/a&gt;, which grades coins, trading cards, and other collectibles and memorabilia. The purchase signals video games’ growing prominence in the world of collectibles, which has seen significant interest recently due to the skyrocketing value of things like Pokémon cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wfeEc"&gt;“Collectibles across categories, including trading cards and sports memorabilia, are now firmly considered an alternative investment class by both hobbyists and investors,” said Nat Turner, executive chair of Collectors Universe, in a press release. “With those categories seeing a stratospheric rise recently, we’ve identified video games as the next area primed for similar expansion. We’re partnering with Wata because they are the experts in video game grading and there’s simply no other way to recreate the amazing and trusted company they have built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lvDyA"&gt;Wata will continue operating as a standalone business with its current leadership, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjIdhy"&gt;It’s not the only recent business shift in the collectibles world; Collectors Universe itself was &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005284/en/Investor-Group-Led-by-Nat-Turner-Completes-Acquisition-of-Collectors-Universe"&gt;acquired by an investor group in February&lt;/a&gt;. And a different investment group that includes Jay-Z’s Roc Nation &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210701005601/en/Blackstone-Tactical-Opportunities-to-Acquire-the-Certified-Collectibles-Group-a-Leading-Provider-of-Tech-Enabled-Authentication-Grading-and-Conservation-Services-for-the-Global-Collectibles-Industry"&gt;acquired Certified Collectibles Group (CCG)&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.cgccomics.com/"&gt;owns comic book and trading card grader CGC&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this month. CGC wants to get in on the video game grading market as well, having just announced on July 8th that it is hiring video game experts for a new division, &lt;a href="https://www.cgccomics.com/news/article/9052/video-game-grader/"&gt;CGC Video Games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neurocracy is future fiction in the form of Wikipedia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sT_YIz8nVLjzjAAGLQ4oKmgRS6M=/220x0:1678x972/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582766/neurocracy_screenshot_light3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How Half-Life and Deus Ex laid the foundation for a Wikipedia-style murder mystery game&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="spFgyo"&gt;In 2048, Wikipedia doesn’t exist. Without enough donations and too many copyright claims, it has to shut down. In 2049, a new substitute rises: Omnipedia, built in the spirit of its predecessor as a free encyclopedia for all. Days after Omnipedia’s launch, its main investor Xu Shaoyong, arguably the most powerful man on the planet, is assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwjRnO"&gt;This is the fictional universe of &lt;a href="https://neurocracy.site/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an experimental narrative project that takes place over 10 episodes, starting on July 14th. Through Omnipedia, it invites readers to solve Xu’s murder in a near future where millions of people suffer from Cariappa-Muren disease, a fatal condition caused by infected tuna. Famed neuroscientist and activist Connie Muren, who helped discover the disease, has vanished without a trace. The environment is falling apart from irreversible climate change, and the world lives under a biosurveillance system called G6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZ5BJy"&gt;Whether you see &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; as hypertext fiction or an offshoot of an alternate reality game, it’s the first project of its kind, using a medium that we take for granted every day. The entire game takes place in your browser on the Omnipedia site.  Each weekly episode represents one day in &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;, and as time “passes,” Omnipedia entries will undergo updates and revisions just like the real Wikipedia. There &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;other types of wiki-based metafiction — projects like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557180/excalibur-interactive-fiction-fan-wiki-lost-tv-show-twine"&gt;Excalibur&lt;/a&gt;, which is styled as a fan-made wiki for a fictional TV show. But none that tell a story quite like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoWxCA"&gt;The game has been in the works for years, albeit in different forms. &lt;a href="https://egmnow.com/hypertext-transfer-wikipedia-and-the-rise-of-the-database-game/"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, its creators &lt;a href="https://playthroughline.com/"&gt;Joannes Truyens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ambientimpact.com/"&gt;Matei Stanca&lt;/a&gt; began considering crowdfunding to keep development going; writer Truyens had started working on the project in 2016 based on an idea for a sci-fi world that he had 20 years ago as a teen. The following year, they raised a modest £12,000 on Kickstarter, which allowed them to commission art for Omnipedia from concept artist and illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.alice-duke.com/"&gt;Alice Duke&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the project has cultivated a tight-knit community that eagerly shares theories on the &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; Discord. The final project boasts over 30 different articles, each painstakingly constructed in the same familiar dry wiki-tone with meticulous citations, each echoes with its own episodic variations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etasuX"&gt;But 2019 was an eternity ago. Our new corona-reality shares unnerving parallels with &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;, which revolves around all-too-familiar points of modern anxiety: pandemics, billionaires, AI, climate change, and biosecurity in the name of public health. “Even when an actual, real-life pandemic dropped and started preempting some of &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;’s worldbuilding, the Wikipedia format has enabled us to quickly adapt and incorporate the lessons from this first modern-day pandemic into our fictional one,” says Truyens, who struggled over whether to mention COVID-19 at all. “Ultimately it’s one of those mass-scale events that divides history into a before and after, so I couldn’t leave it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MOPcI7M6b8vsp4zin1Y-bJaNK5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717141/neurocracy_screenshot_dark1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d2iXrd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;’s origins go back to the early 2000s when Truyens and Stanca met through the &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt; modding scene. They worked on a few projects, leading to a &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt;-inspired total conversion mod called Omnius Global, which followed Marc Laidlaw’s screenplay-style format for &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;. While Omnius Global didn’t go anywhere — Truyens &lt;a href="https://playthroughline.com/blog/2021/05/05/the-origins-and-inspirations-of-neurocracy"&gt;does not mince words&lt;/a&gt; about the quality of the old screenplay — it contained a crucial element of &lt;em&gt;Neurocrac&lt;/em&gt;y’s narrative foundation, its wiki-style story bible. The in-universe text in &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex &lt;/em&gt;had such a profound worldbuilding influence on Truyens that he included its lead writer, &lt;a href="http://sheldonpacotti.com/"&gt;Sheldon Pacotti&lt;/a&gt;, in Omnipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKBDrH"&gt;“A large part of the depiction of AI in &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; is predicated on his work, to the point it’s called ‘the Pacotti architecture,’” says Truyens, pointing to &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/designing-intelligence-c78f9959b3b8"&gt;one of Pacotti’s articles&lt;/a&gt; as the basis for his fictional AI. On his blog, he attributes &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;’s “the concept art is the final art” approach to &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; — a vision that has been enhanced by illustrator Duke’s artistic direction for the world of 2049. “&lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; invites players to add their own meanings and interpretations to what they read on Omnipedia and the idea is for the visuals to afford a similar possibility space,” Truyens says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F7ToFL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m obsessed right now with reality television and micro-celebrity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZO5Yu"&gt;Pacotti hasn’t been able to contribute to &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; (yet), but Truyens is far from alone. He’s assembled a dream team whose vastly different interests and writing styles only strengthen the game’s fiction of multiple people contributing to Omnipedia. Guest writers include award-winning narrative designer &lt;a href="http://leighalexander.net/"&gt;Leigh Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, sci-fi authors &lt;a href="https://malkaolder.wordpress.com/"&gt;Malka Older&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://yudhanjaya.com/"&gt;Yudhanjaya Wijeratne&lt;/a&gt;, and writer / critic &lt;a href="https://axeltaiari.com/"&gt;Axel Taiari&lt;/a&gt;. Older teaches predictive fiction and has managed humanitarian aid work in Darfur, Indonesia, and Japan. Wijeratne researches misinformation and online communities and founded the fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://watchdog.team/about.html"&gt;Watchdog&lt;/a&gt;. Alexander has been at the forefront of internet culture and near-futurist writing for years, and Taiari has over a decade of experience in technical writing in the infosec sector. (He’s also starting a PhD program on &lt;a href="https://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/hypertext.html"&gt;hypertextuality&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sb6zSk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;’s wiki-format also invites us to examine our changing relationship with ubiquitous language technology, which includes everything from Gmail reply suggestions to AI transcription services. As a researcher, Wijeratne does ongoing work with human-AI language technology; in one instance, he retrained an OpenAI GPT-2 language model to write poetry for his novel &lt;em&gt;The Salvage Crew&lt;/em&gt;. He even had a language model trained on Wikipedia bios, which was a great fit for &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy. &lt;/em&gt;In the future, Omnipedia entries are drafted by artificial neural networks before human editors step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VvkGZ"&gt;“I had trained it as a demonstration of what we could face in the coming years with human editing and AI ‘textual diarrhea’ combining to build authoritative-looking websites with enormous amounts of content in days,” Wijeratne explains. “I looked at &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; and thought: this is perfect. It gave me vibes of &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/08/20/the-unsung-muse-of-speculative-fiction-is-a-wikipedia-community/"&gt;the SCP wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and of Borges’ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths"&gt;Garden of Forking Paths&lt;/a&gt;.” As with the other guest writers, for Wijeratne, the prospect of contributing to &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; was a no-brainer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH8kVT"&gt;Given the episodic format of the game and the modern-day horror of &lt;em&gt;spoilers&lt;/em&gt;, it’s incredibly difficult to get hard details from any of the writers on their contributions. Malka Older, who specializes in disaster response management, geopolitics, and worldbuilding, is understandably coy about her storylines. Leigh Alexander is using her interest in the social and cultural impact of tech to balance out the hard science. “I decided to come at &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt;’s world through media, entertainment, and play,” she says, pointing to her narrative work in games, which recently included &lt;a href="https://leighalexander.net/projects/love-island-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Island 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on the UK reality show. “And while I love all kinds of storytelling, I’m obsessed right now with reality television and micro-celebrity. It felt really important for me to have these elements in any vision of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlCfDV"&gt;Even just going through the demo, it’s clear that &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just about a murder. It’s one corner of an intricate, multifaceted mystery that cries out for a &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia"&gt;Pepe Silvia conspiracy board&lt;/a&gt;. Taiari points out that building one big mystery just doesn’t work for the hypertext format, which demands careful layers of storytelling. Truyens briefed the guest writers on his extensive notes and plotlines and gave everyone the freedom to explore on their own. “None of our contributions are even close to resembling each other,” Taiari says. “And yet, because we all started our exploration from the same vantage point, and returned to it, it’s all connected — like a cave system. On top of it, the temporal, episodic angle adds a Mr. Robot-like layer and provides a unifying thread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAIzwV5PEMpBagzHnbPJq51aqLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717248/neurocracy_screenshot_light3.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vVAoB"&gt;As for more details about fictional Omnipedia editors and mods and other in-game features, Truyens isn’t giving anything away. “The hope is that we establish some level of audience feedback, where we release an episode, look at the story theories that emerge, and then adapt the next episode to those theories,” he explains, which aligns him closer to an experimental dungeon master rather than a conventional author. “There are plenty of threads where we’ve left things intentionally ambiguous or undefined.” New players are welcome to join the &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; Discord, which is already brimming with reader theories. “If we end up birthing a subreddit, also good,” Truyens says. “We know the ending, it’s just a matter of what we will and won’t communicate about it,” he adds rather cryptically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbHctk"&gt;Considering how attached we are to our devices, to the stupefying convenience of accessing the entirety of human history with a few clicks and swipes, the idea of &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; seems natural. Wikipedia is not just for niche interests; it’s a part of daily modern life as a utilitarian descendant of early internet bulletin boards and forums. “Having a futurist story experience that unfolds across a fictional Wikipedia feels a lot more accessible to me as a concept now than it would have felt even 10 years ago,” says Alexander. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vyo0fK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no game to play if we tell you what to solve”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o9KD2o"&gt;At the same time,&lt;em&gt; Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic example of how Truyens and Stanca are subverting our relationship to ergodic text — that is, text that you have to make real effort to understand, which some consider a downer in traditional games where the focus is on gameplay and mechanics. Ironically, many of the same people who brag about never reading &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; worldbuilding text and dialogue also spend hours going over arcane theorycrafting forums and convoluted game guides. “Most literature is, by design, as non-ergodic as possible. As a novelist, it’s my job to keep the reader turning the page,” says Wijeratne. “Hypertext is niche because it needs that nontrivial effort to traverse the narrative. The irony is that more people are also navigating hypertext in the context of games: game wikis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xALTP"&gt;Wikipedia is far more than a bone-dry resource for basic information about history and geology or quantum physics theories that your boyfriend won’t shut up about. It’s become a sinkhole that too many of us are prepared to traverse deep into the wee hours of the morning, and a perfectly formed door into narrative experiments that question the way we examine real-world media. “There is no game to play if we tell you what to solve, or how to solve it, or whether it can be solved at all,” says Taiari. “As a result, all the ingrained pattern recognition and habits gamers have when it comes to wikis get scrambled. Is this page meant to help me, or trick me? Who wrote this and why… what matters to me, as a player? What should I care about and try to decode?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hwO3OO"&gt;Ultimately, to borrow from something Truyens told me in 2019, &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; is a story we tell ourselves — a way to make sense of the world given to us in Omnipedia, and perhaps come to some realizations about our current reality in the process. “If what we tried to do with &lt;em&gt;Neurocracy&lt;/em&gt; works, then players will generate their own reading / playing / decoding strategies and, in turn, narrate the world to themselves and others,” says Taiari. “The stories that emerge as a result, whether they decrypt parts of the world or contribute to its occlusion — well, those stories aren’t ours to tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1NwdA"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who missed the Kickstarter, the game will be available to purchase directly through Omnipedia at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurocracy.site/"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurocracy.site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fcxxns"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBh9ry"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0b7sTV"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and cellular connectivity, which starts at $399. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqOTAE"&gt;The highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bRFJnd"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3 (38mm, GPS): $168 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$199&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lREHEL"&gt;Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS, white): $269 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals060721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$279&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BR7xFN"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm, GPS, red): $319 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; ($&lt;s&gt;399&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="ParVAK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the watchOS 8 public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558944/watchos-beta-install-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent price. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $168 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in either white or black, which is $31 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped white version of the SE for $269 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger GPS model, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club has several configurations&lt;/a&gt; of the 44mm model available for $300, a slight discount exclusive to members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Right now, deals are relatively scarce on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $319. You can also snag the larger, 44mm upgrade at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $349, slightly more than its best-ever price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft threatens to resurrect Clippy as an Office emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdyYTuG5KJbkjFErFs7hveHX_c8=/2x0:1060x705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582351/clippy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cBe3DF"&gt;Microsoft is threatening to bring back its &lt;s&gt;annoying&lt;/s&gt; loveable Clippy character. The software giant claims it will replace the paperclip emoji in Microsoft Office with Clippy if the tweet below gets 20,000 likes. The tweet has already passed 9,000 likes, so Clippy could be about to return as a more innocent emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrDabj"&gt;Born in Office 97, Clippy originally appeared as an assistant to offer help and tips for using Microsoft Office. You either loved or hated its Groucho eyebrows and persistence, and Microsoft eventually killed off Clippy in Office XP in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="InkWpv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If this gets 20k likes, we’ll replace the paperclip emoji in Microsoft 365 with Clippy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6T8ziboguC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6T8ziboguC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft (@Microsoft) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1415370520888061955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DF1KPb"&gt;The famous paperclip nearly made a return a couple of years ago, though. Some Microsoft employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18276923/microsoft-clippy-microsoft-teams-stickers-removal"&gt;briefly resurrected Clippy as animated stickers in Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s “brand police” swooped in to shut the effort down. It was a brutal firing of the anthropomorphic paperclip, but it looks like Microsoft has now realized humans like to have fun while they’re entering data into spreadsheets or creating a PowerPoint presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gd39fd"&gt;So will we finally see Clippy return to Microsoft Office? Microsoft is currently holding Clippy hostage behind a tweet that needs 20,000 likes. As every YouTuber puts it, hit that like button &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers and we’ll find out what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly worked on an Alexa wearable for kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKAB8mW_hQM6K4pGhDECsitjxTc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582291/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pums1e"&gt;Amazon toyed with yet another way of ingratiating itself into the lives of you and your family through an Alexa-enabled wearable for kids, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/amazon-considered-developing-alexa-wearable-device-for-children"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The device was considered for Amazon’s 2020 product roadmap, according to documents &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; viewed, and it would have added to the company’s growing stable of kid-focused tech products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1USyQf"&gt;The $99 wearable, codenamed “Seeker,” would reportedly feature GPS, voice activation (presumably for some kind of Alexa features), and be targeted for children ages four to 12. The finer details of the physical design of the device seem like they were still up in the air. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes the wearable could have come as a clip, keychain, or wristband. The goal seemed to be delivering exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; content (formerly Amazon FreeTime Unlimited) while allowing parents to track and communicate with their kids. Amazon reportedly also worked with Disney on a wearable called the “Magic Band.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eTqKoiGtomxNbbFgKWea6qBdt8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989892/dseifert_201025_4263_0008.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s newest Echo Dot Kids Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="skm2js"&gt;This wearable wouldn’t have been Amazon’s first time at the kid tech rodeo. The company’s been pushing Alexa into kids’ playrooms and bedrooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17276164/amazon-echo-dot-kids-edition-freetime-price-announcement-features-specs"&gt;via the Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; since 2018. Amazon’s built some interesting functionality on top of its child-friendly speakers and tablets — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22554428/amazon-reading-sidekick-alexa-echo-skill-kids-voice-profiles"&gt;like helping kids learn to read&lt;/a&gt; — but the company has also been criticized in the past for how Alexa &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18550425/amazon-echo-dot-kids-privacy-markey-blumenthal-ftc"&gt;might allegedly violate children’s privacy&lt;/a&gt; by storing voice recordings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcQjMA"&gt;Despite the concerns over children’s privacy and the generally vague details of this wearable, it makes sense that Amazon would try to get into this space. Plenty of other companies have also made attempts, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22315951/fitbit-ace-3-fitness-tracker-kids"&gt;Fitbit’s Ace 3&lt;/a&gt; for tracking kids’ physical activity or Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21432363/apple-watch-se-price-features-specs-series-3-successor"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, which is just a less expensive smartwatch but was pitched with a focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21518711/apple-watch-family-setup-test-review-features-explainer"&gt;Apple’s Family Setup feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpe4Gg"&gt;There’s lots of reasons to sell gadgets to kids (another source of valuable data, for one), but the most common seems to be that parents, despite how invasive it might seem, really like to track the location of their kids. Given how often my own parents use Apple’s Find My to check on the location of my younger siblings, if they were any younger, they’d probably be wearing some kind of kid’s wearable by now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T says it will bring mmWave 5G to seven US airports this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YAK_Y4vUCoSNCnTOWhYM8bpwr8g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582233/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company is partnering with Boingo to deploy 5G Plus in parts of US airports.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RwlOut"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has announced a partnership with Boingo Wireless to bring its fast mmWave 5G — which it calls 5G Plus — to more US airports, with a goal of seven by the end of the year and 25 by the end of 2022. That’s counting its &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/5g_plus_airports.html"&gt;first deployment in Tampa International Airport&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. There’s a little bit of a catch, though; travelers will only find 5G Plus in certain areas of the airport, like major gates and concessions areas. Still, it’s one place where range-limited but powerful mmWave might actually make sense. When else do you need to download an entire movie while you wait for your latte?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iC9Gnh"&gt;Boingo is known for providing Wi-Fi to air travelers, but what AT&amp;amp;T is deploying isn’t 5G-branded Wi-Fi. Any AT&amp;amp;T subscriber with the right phone and a 5G plan will be able to connect automatically to the network. As a reminder, not all 5G phones include mmWave support; the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21 series do, but it’s scarcer among midrange and budget devices. And AT&amp;amp;T isn’t the only one teaming up with Boingo on airport 5G: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20827985/verizon-5g-indoor-boingo-partnership-problem-solution-phoenix"&gt;Verizon announced its own partnership in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and it currently offers its fastest 5G flavor in a dozen airports, including Tampa International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Puhk"&gt;Bringing mmWave 5G from the outside to indoor locations presents some unique challenges: the higher frequencies it uses provide huge capacity and speeds but don’t travel far and are easily stopped by walls, windows, and other obstacles. However, according to AT&amp;amp;T’s SVP of Network Infrastructure Mo Katibeh, focusing deployment &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; high-traffic indoor locations is in many ways easier than bringing mmWave to an open-air location like a city block. Working with one building owner tends to be easier than with many building and land owners to lease space for equipment, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sT2uAf"&gt;Katibeh sees strategic 5G Plus deployments like these as an important piece of its overall 5G strategy in the next few years. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, he emphasized that the company has first focused on extending its 5G coverage nationwide, using mmWave for dense urban areas and venues, which he says are the places “where 5G plus really shines.” Verizon, on the other hand, put more emphasis on mmWave 5G early on, which &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/the-age-of-mmwave-5g-sputters-to-dusty-death/a/d-id/770838?"&gt;hasn’t panned out very well&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.opensignal.com/2021/07/13/quantifying-the-mmwave-5g-experience-in-the-us-july-update"&gt;according to Open Signal&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon users that it tracked over a recent 90-day period spent less than 1 percent of the time connected to mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRIpGn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T still has plenty to prove with its 5G network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277484/att-fake-5g-e-network-lte-study"&gt;after a rocky start&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, the company made a bunch of other partnership announcements today, mostly centered on entertainment and augmented reality applications. The company has introduced interactive AR &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; characters, thanks to &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/5g_facebook.html"&gt;a partnership with Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s working on &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/newsroom/2021/5g_nba_wnba.html"&gt;more AR features for the WNBA’s app&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. While potentially useful and sensible 5G developments are underway, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;the 5G hype machine&lt;/a&gt; sure hasn’t gone anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9QXXG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 14th, 3:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Mo Katibeh is the Senior Vice President of AT&amp;amp;T Network Infrastructure and Build. A previous version of this article misspelled his last name as Kabiteh; we regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2RS0YX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746200082884103876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodsDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to $200 or lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $179 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/oendKE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, are currently selling the AirPods Pro for just shy of $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max haven’t historically seen large price drops — they only made their debut in December, after all — their price has been steadily falling in recent weeks, leaving them at an all-time low. Currently, all colorways of the AirPods Max are available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746203302394629120#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $473 and $480, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki: the latest news and reviews for the Marvel show on Disney Plus</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Stay up to date with the trickster god&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="1EeiuH"&gt;Disney Plus is quickly becoming an integral part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Through shows like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, the streaming service has been able to tell longer-form stories outside of the blockbuster superhero movies. The latest such show is &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, which sees Tom Hiddleston reprise his role as the trickster god in a time-traveling sci-fi whodunnit. Here you’ll find the latest news about the show as well as analyses, cast interviews, and even the occasional gadget review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki’s first season is the best of Marvel without the baggage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Loki" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iynj59QotFzx1NoARqoYTErCU84=/714x0:3126x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69581989/1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The most standalone MCU series yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AooWlt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;did something remarkable: it made me forget about the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzgBhh"&gt;That’s not how it’s supposed to work. The entire conceit of the MCU is that every story, whether it’s a blockbuster movie or a streaming television show, is in service to the greater narrative arc. You’re not just watching what’s happening to the characters on-screen, but also hints of what comes next. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t get away from that entirely, particularly with its conclusion that sets up the universe’s next big villain. But like the variants who inhabit &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s world outside of time, the six-episode first season carves out its own timeline — a few of them, in fact — making it perhaps the most standalone part of the MCU to date. You can enjoy it as part of the all-encompassing cinematic universe or as what it truly is: an excellent piece of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="386OYP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s first season ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XTYBa"&gt;The show doesn’t seem that standalone at first. It opens with a scene from &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes off with a powerful device known as the Tesseract. From here, the story diverges from what we’ve seen in the MCU. Loki is apprehended by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which is sort of like a time-traveling FBI with one specific purpose: to protect the “sacred timeline.” From the TVA, Loki learns that he’s a variant, which is a fancy word for someone who deviates from the timeline set out by a mysterious trio called the Time Keepers, who control the flow of time and created the TVA in order to maintain its purity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-Q9PtGFeK-yWGlBUEAgDZd1lLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717364/2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CI45uj"&gt;Typically, variants are pruned, a nice way of saying they’re killed in order to protect that timeline from diverging from the plan. But the TVA has other ideas for Loki. Another variant has been terrorizing the TVA, appearing at multiple periods throughout time and space in order to kill their agents. This variant also happens to be another Loki — making our Loki the perfect man to track them down. It’s a lot to keep track of. There are parallel worlds and multiple timelines, not to mention the fact that this is a show starring the least-reliable narrator in the Marvel universe. The mystery of the TVA steadily grows over the course of the show; it seems like everyone knows either a lot less or a lot more than they’re letting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LhRhNv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22576224/tva-tempad-review-loki-season-1-review-marvel-timedoor"},{"title":"How Loki built a different reality with retro hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"},{"title":"Loki director Kate Herron says the show is a ‘big love letter to sci-fi’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22525909/loki-director-kate-herron-interview"},{"title":"We spoke to Tom Hiddleston about Loki, PowerPoint presentations, and the nature of free will","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22524176/tom-hiddleston-interview-loki-disney-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIDWMn"&gt;Within this framework, the show jumps across genres, starting out a bit like a buddy cop series. After Loki is processed through the TVA’s charmingly banal bureaucracy, he forms an uneasy alliance with agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) in order to track down the killer variant. From there, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; heads into more explicit sci-fi territory; one episode takes place on a dying moon that’s about to be crushed by a planet, while another is set in a void at the end of time that seems to be populated entirely by alternate versions of Loki. Things move with an incredible sense of momentum. Hiddleston’s Loki is constantly on the run, eventually switching allegiances to work with the variant he was meant to capture — who calls herself Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino) — as the two decide to take down the TVA together. Once the TVA and its many confusing rules are established, this relationship between two Lokis, which starts out antagonistic before becoming more intimate, forms the thrust of the show. There are a few pacing issues, like a third episode that ends on a frustrating cliffhanger and a monologue-filled finale, but for the most part, &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;moves along at a satisfyingly brisk rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzTEL3"&gt;The show touches on a lot of lofty themes, like the idea of parallel worlds and whether free will can even exist in a multiverse. But grounding it all is Hiddleston’s take on Loki. This is the deepest, most intimate look we’ve had at the character so far, despite six film cameos spanning a decade. Here, he’s given a chance to grow across nearly six hours of screen time. Growth isn’t something typically associated with Loki. He’s a compulsive liar and a narcissist, someone so single-mindedly focused on himself that nothing else seems to matter. But in the show, that changes — in the most Loki way possible. He literally falls in love with himself. It sounds strange, but one of the most important arcs in the show is the budding romance between Loki and Sylvie, two versions of the same being. But &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; Loki would finally find love in a variant of himself. But &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; someone with such a violently self-hating streak would only find real self-actualization in a romance... with himself. He grows over the course of the show, but he’s still Loki after all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tTmXKM"&gt;The story of love, betrayal, and self-determination is buoyed by an excellent cast. Hiddleston adds a depth to Loki that we haven’t seen yet — he slowly peels back the trickster persona to reveal who he is when not causing trouble — and he has a magnetic chemistry with both Wilson and Di Martino; the former is full of playful banter, the latter a mix of tender moments and fierce battles. There’s also an alarmingly straightforward bureaucrat (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), an off-kilter man behind the curtain who makes eating an apple look menacing (Jonathan Majors), a tough-but-conflicted TVA hunter (Wunmi Mosaku), and even a suspiciously friendly Siri-like character called Miss Minutes (Tara Strong) to round things out. Everyone just seems like they’re having a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aza6nv"&gt;It’s also incredibly charming — not only the excellent cast, but the universe and aesthetic, from the 1970s-style retro-futurism to gorgeous alien worlds that look like a Roger Dean painting come to life. Things get pretty weird, like when you meet a whole gang of Lokis, including an alligator and a Loki who actually managed to survive to old age (played by a Richard E. Grant who looks like he’s having the time of his life). &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;is a mashup of sci-fi influences — you can see everything from &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; — that, while not entirely unique, at least feels distinct from the rest of the MCU. It’s playful and heartfelt in equal measure, and it all looks really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQSTIe"&gt;This idea of isolating from the rest of the Marvel universe isn’t completely new. It’s part of what made &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;so appealing — at least at first. The otherness of the show’s sitcom-inspired world was refreshing. But steadily, more MCU-like elements crept into Wanda’s fantasy, until the show felt like what it truly was: a continuation of the Avengers storyline. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is much more of its own thing. There are references to characters and plots, of course, but they feel secondary. And even when the show does reveal its bigger purpose within the machinations of the MCU (it introduces Majors’ character, Kang the Conqueror, who is set to appear in &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; a few years from now), it doesn’t pull you out of the story. If you’re not up on Marvel lore, you probably won’t even realize what’s happening. Rather it feels like a natural setup for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576741/loki-season-2-confirmed"&gt;the now-confirmed season 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Xw2sWp"&gt;In fact, if you’re somehow new to this whole Marvel thing, I’d recommend &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; as the place to start. It’s the best of what the superhero genre has to offer without all of the homework.&lt;/p&gt;
