    <title>Amazon is getting hauled into court for not recalling dangerous products the right way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdVYUs8LwKVQIOJrSRAC83bDank=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69596007/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6VzV9S"&gt;Since 2019, Amazon has sold nearly 400,000 hair dryers that could shock someone if they fell into a pool of water, 24,000 carbon monoxide detectors that didn’t actually detect carbon monoxide, and an unspecified number of “children’s sleepwear garments” that didn’t meet flammability requirements, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0knewx"&gt;Now, the US safety regulator wants to force Amazon to recall those products. This past week, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Sues-Amazon-to-Force-Recall-of-Hazardous-Products-Sold-on-Amazon-com"&gt;it sued the company&lt;/a&gt; in a case that could be the latest to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414185/california-appeals-court-amazon-marketplace-responsible-third-party-hoverboard"&gt;hold Amazon accountable for products offered by its third-party sellers&lt;/a&gt;. But here’s the thing: Amazon has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; recalled these specific products. They’re no longer for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG9VGa"&gt;Amazon says, and the CPSC acknowledges, that the giant retailer has already stopped selling these products, already notified their buyers, and already handed out refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jbx1Nl"&gt;Here’s the initial statement Amazon provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="de7pbB"&gt;Customer safety is a top priority and we take prompt action to protect customers when we are aware of a safety concern. As the CPSC’s own complaint acknowledges, for the vast majority of the products in question, Amazon already immediately removed the products from our store, notified customers about potential safety concerns, advised customers to destroy the products, and provided customers with full refunds. For the remaining few products in question, the CPSC did not provide Amazon with enough information for us to take action and despite our requests, CPSC has remained unresponsive. Amazon has an industry-leading recalls program and we have further offered to expand our capabilities to handle recalls for all products sold in our store, regardless of whether those products were sold or fulfilled by Amazon or third-party sellers. We are unclear as to why the CPSC has rejected that offer or why they have filed a complaint seeking to force us to take actions almost entirely duplicative of those we’ve already taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WtTw2j"&gt;What’s actually going on here? We spoke to the CPSC, and it claims there’s a few big problems with the way Amazon’s handling the issue. Primarily, that the CPSC would have to take Amazon’s word that the recall is being handled and that these dangerous products are actually being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUhHU9"&gt;In the statement, Amazon says that the CPSC rejected its offer to work together on this issue, and it seems like that might be true — because Amazon’s offer was a “proposed recalls pledge” that would let online marketplaces handle recalls themselves. Here’s the proposal Amazon sent the CPSC on May 6th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCYCtv"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21010448-amazon-cpsc-letter-to-commissioners-signed/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Amazon - CPSC Letter to Commissioners Signed (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nTDtyQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk0g9M"&gt;The CPSC originally suggested to us that pledge wasn’t a legally binding agreement, either — it might have to take Amazon’s word that it would, for instance, provide regular reports about the progress of a recall so the CPSC can follow up. If Amazon didn’t adequately tell customers how to destroy dangerous products or how to ship them back at no charge, the CPSC might not be able to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3PNVF"&gt;Amazon suggests that’s not true, though.  “Amazon proposed an agreement that would be legally binding, and that was developed and agreed upon with the CPSC staff,” it tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The retailer says it worked “hand-in-hand” with the CPSC through this entire process, used a recall template that “we discussed and agreed upon with the CPSC staff,” and suggests it doesn’t understand why the CPSC changed its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwp5G2"&gt;Neither Amazon nor the CPSC would let &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;see a copy of their proposed agreement, but Amazon did give us copies of the recall notices it sent to customers. One example:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V38zghj_YOppLXPSYd14gJTAGs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22723831/amazon_notice_recall.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="esjW1q"&gt;Amazon says there’s a simple reason you don’t see any mention of returns: “Amazon did not require the return of these products before issuing a refund because CPSC had not asked us to and because such a step is unusual for recalls of these product types,” Amazon tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NRIgAh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s about the long game, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDKl4o"&gt;There are bigger things at stake than the recalls of these specific products, though. CPSC’s move is also about finding the authority to force recalls on broad online seller marketplaces like Amazon to begin with, marketplaces which weren’t around at the time the laws were written — that way, it wouldn’t always need to rely on Amazon being willing to comply. CPSC acting chairman Robert Adler hints at this difficulty in a statement (&lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/Statement%20on%20Amazon%20RSA%207.14.pdf?1yhJvJ7Pp5JRVCX2qW1UYJ7td8nId6dA"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) issued alongside the complaint: “for every product which CPSC determines a recall is necessary, a lengthy negotiation must first take place about the threshold question of whether that sales platform is even subject to our laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXQqVB"&gt;The CPSC says its existing statute gives it legal authority when it comes to importers, distributors and manufacturers, and it’s now arguing the way Amazon handles its “Fulfilled by Amazon” products clearly makes it a distributor under the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Nzq4"&gt;“We are seeking Amazon to be responsible for the ‘fulfilled by Amazon’ products on their site; Amazon does not see themselves legally responsible for these products. We assert Amazon has legal responsibility as a distributor for the safety of these products,” the CPSC tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding “We are eager to collaborate with them on details of a recall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl0B97"&gt;Amazon, of course, doesn’t want to be categorized as a distributor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="llM27S"&gt;We disagree with CPSC’s assertion that we are a distributor under this statute, and our perspective was reinforced by Chairman Adler’s statement. However, more importantly, Amazon has always believed that we have an obligation to our customers to provide the safest shopping experience. This is why Amazon has messaged customers and covered the cost of refunds when selling partners failed to engage with regulators about recalls. We did this for the products noted in the lawsuit, and worked with CPSC staff to finalize an agreement that would establish a new-norm for recalls of third-party products. We are unclear as to why the CPSC Commission rejected that offer, particularly as its staff worked hand-in-hand with us to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2mtAKT"&gt;If this does get dragged out in the courts, the CPSC says it might take many years to conclude, with previous forced recalls taking five to seven years on average. The first step is getting the case in front of an administrative law judge (of which the CPSC says it doesn’t have any of its own), after which Amazon may have several opportunities to appeal, first to the CPSC itself and then in the federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzZqnF"&gt;You can read the CPSC’s full complaint against Amazon below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TurboTax parent company Intuit is exiting the IRS Free File Program </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intuit Inc.’s TurboTax Software" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2nnGt56BK2sFnQHITLMIi1oGzDU=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69595911/138903641.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVaA6T"&gt;Intuit, the parent company of tax filing software TurboTax, is exiting an IRS program that allows many Americans to file their taxes for free. The IRS partners with the &lt;a href="https://freefilealliance.org/"&gt;Free File Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit coalition of tax software &lt;a href="https://freefilealliance.org/free-file-alliance-members/"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; that offer no-cost tax filing services for the Free File program. &lt;a href="https://www.intuit.com/blog/news-social/accelerating-technology-innovation-to-better-help-consumers-solve-their-most-pressing-financial-problems/"&gt;Intuit says in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on its website that part of the reason it’s leaving Free File— which is available to 2020 filers with &lt;a href="https://freefilealliance.org/faq/"&gt;adjusted gross income of $72,000&lt;/a&gt; or less— is the “restraints” of the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImC846"&gt;“With the Free File program surpassing its founding goals of e-file and free tax preparation, and due to the limitations of the Free File program and conflicting demands from those outside the program, we are not able to continue in the program and deliver all of the benefits that can help consumers make more money, save more, and invest for the future,” according to the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7TRPO"&gt;Readers may recall that a series of &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/the-turbotax-trap"&gt;reports by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block had misled filers into paying to file their taxes. The companies kept the free versions of their software from &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines"&gt;showing up in search engine results&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;, making them harder to find online. The IRS later &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-reforms-free-file-program-drops-agreement-not-to-compete-with-turbotax"&gt;overhauled the Free File&lt;/a&gt; program, removing a provision in the agreement that prohibited the agency from creating an online filing system of its own that would compete with the software companies’ products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NhS7O"&gt;Intuit’s blog post says the company will leave the Free File program at the end of the tax season in October because it wants to “provide more financial benefits and empower Americans of all income levels to take control of their finances.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1cmZA"&gt;Intuit closed on an acquisition of credit score monitoring company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150609/turbo-tax-credit-karma-intuit-purchase-competitor-credit-checks"&gt;Credit Karma for $7.1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020. The deal drew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353085/turbotax-intuit-credit-karma-purchase-tax-preparation-services-doj-antitrust"&gt;scrutiny from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, which was concerned about potential antitrust issues; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/free-credit-karma-tax-service-now-available-for-2017-tax-filing-season-300394430.html"&gt;Credit Karma started offering&lt;/a&gt; its own version of free tax filing in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Full Self Driving subscriptions are now available for $199 a month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYVW4sogGnQQahqgq6OV5XBU0oc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69595351/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Stnrxd"&gt;Tesla has started offering a monthly subscription for its Full Self Driving package for $199 per month (h/t &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Tesla owners who bought the since-discontinued Enhanced Autopilot package can get the FSD subscription for $99 per month, according to &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/full-self-driving-subscriptions#pricing"&gt;Tesla’s support page&lt;/a&gt;. Until now the automaker had sold its FSD package for a one-time fee of $10,000, but the monthly subscription lets users test-drive (literally) the FSD features without a long-term commitment. Tesla owners can cancel their monthly FSD subscription at any time, according to the terms on the Tesla website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zcJmd"&gt;Only Teslas that have the FSD computer hardware 3.0 (HW3) or above plus either Basic or Enhanced Autopilot configurations are eligible to subscribe to FSD; other owners can purchase a hardware upgrade for $1,500 to make their vehicles FSD-ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYBPHb"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk had been promising a subscription option for FSD for a few years now. Tesla finally began sending out over-the-air software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570081/tesla-fsd-v9-beta-autopilot-update"&gt;updates for the beta &lt;/a&gt;of version 9 of FSD earlier this month. As a reminder, the FSD software does not enable a Tesla vehicle to drive itself without input from the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6raEyG"&gt;An owner shared a notice they had &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/17/tesla-debuts-fsd-subscription-for-199-per-month.html"&gt;received from Tesla with CNBC,&lt;/a&gt; which said the FSD subscription included “features like Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, Auto Park, Summon and Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control.” The notice also stated that “the currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoMAq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The space tourism industry is stuck in its billionaire phase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORRyEpax417RGqs960dim3-LRYE=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69595156/1233924109.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The spectacle of launching billionaires into space is the beginning of a long road ahead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vrEatA"&gt;Richard Branson’s extravagant jaunt to space on Sunday signaled the dawning of a new space age — for the few people that can afford it. Jeff Bezos is about to set off on a similar excursion next Tuesday when he launches to space with three others on his company Blue Origin’s first crewed flight. The two billionaires are validating their companies’ tourist-tailored rockets and, they say, fulfilling lifelong dreams to get a brief taste of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gadMYr"&gt;But what Virgin Galactic’s mission on Sunday proved, and what Bezos’ flight will similarly show, is that space is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; open, not for you and me or the general public, but for more billionaires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKPATX"&gt;Opening up the cosmos to the masses and normalizing space travel is a goal companies and their billionaire backers have been targeting for years but haven’t yet achieved. There’s economic potential beyond launching rich people to space: microgravity research for scientists and — a much farther goal — rapid transportation between continents. That’s the vision they’re selling with these flashy flights; once exclusive to government astronauts, traveling in space could be a thing for everyone else too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GxDUFa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s tough at the beginning”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmAnQD"&gt;“That’s the dream, right? That space isn’t just for NASA anymore,” Kathy Lueders, NASA’s human spaceflight chief who oversaw development of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon astronaut capsule, said during a press conference in April. “I mean, I think that’s what we’re trying to do... what we were hoping is that you would hopefully have so many customers that at one point, the price-point would go down to having it be accessible. It’s tough at the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbxheo"&gt;In this beginning phase, flying to space is priced only for the ultra-rich, driven by the high costs of new space technology. Virgin Galactic’s launch of Richard Branson represented one of the final key test missions to validate its shiny six-seated spaceplane, SpaceShipTwo, but it was also a meticulously crafted marketing event, complete with flashy promo videos, inspirational speeches, and a pop concert, all designed to help attract more attention, and more customers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xDS62AonRrv1yp2jGNvC5AixrX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22723074/1233922260.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Guests of Virgin Galactic at Spaceport America watch as Richard Branson’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane takes off under its carrier plane&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7bdbNw"&gt;To live their own version of Branson’s dream, customers will have to pay at least $250,000 for a seat (the company already has roughly 600 booked passengers). And right now, the quarter-million-dollar price tag is the cheapest option on the market. The price for a seat on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket could be higher. And if you want to go into orbit for a few days, a ride on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule will set you back at least $55 million (that could be higher too; SpaceX hasn’t publicly confirmed the real price).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Er8MBD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A long road ahead to bringing prices down&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jYErR7"&gt;While Branson and Bezos’ flights to space mark key moments for their space tourism businesses, the space industry is far from being able to offer its services to the rest of the public. To get there, they’ll have to clear several hurdles: Can these rockets reliably fly humans on multiple missions without a hitch? If there is a hitch, like a fatal accident, can the market survive a damaged reputation? And can someone buy a ticket to space just as they can book an expensive flight (instead of just the ultra-rich)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqwsY0"&gt;Then there’s the court of public opinion, which may be difficult to win over. Bezos, Branson and Elon Musk’s space ambitions have been criticized as another example of billionaires spending money on passion projects when there are places and causes where those funds could arguably be put to better use. The US alone struggles with vast wealth inequities, poor access to healthcare and a rapidly changing climate, among other problems that, when paired with space tourism, makes the activity look insultingly selfish to many. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a leading critic of billionaires, has repeated that point as the private space race heats up. “Here on Earth, in the richest country on the planet, half our people live paycheck to paycheck, people are struggling to feed themselves, struggling to see a doctor — but hey, the richest guys in the world are off in outer space!,” he tweeted in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t5E5Am"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here on Earth, in the richest country on the planet, half our people live paycheck to paycheck, people are struggling to feed themselves, struggling to see a doctor — but hey, the richest guys in the world are off in outer space! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. It's time to tax the billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1414253955480227843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I9sAKg"&gt;“I can understand it,” Branson says of critiques like Sen.

Many of those investments came from public funds — it’s still unclear what spin-off developments might emerge from the still-fledgling private space tourism industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xK0kCl"&gt;As long as the space industry is dependent on billionaire funds for spacecraft built for billionaire (and millionaire) customers, the perception that this is a hobby for the ultrawealthy will inevitably remain. “We have to deal with the fact that billionaires trying to make more money are the public face of the space sector right now,” Brian Weeden, a director at the Secure World Foundation, said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xjUOXe"&gt;Putting faces on nascent industries isn’t unusual in itself. Charles Lindbergh, the first pilot to fly across the Atlantic Ocean alone, famously helped propel commercial aviation from its infancy in the 1920s and 1930s. Same with Steve Jobs or Bill Gates at the dawn of the desktop computer at the end of the 20th century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCOsJk"&gt;Those industries, too, had doubters and critics. The US was skeptical of the early planes being built by the Wright brothers and top military officials dismissed aviation as a fad. “Any man who sticks to it is either crazy or else a plain damned fool,” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Admiral_William_A_Moffett/k5uOBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=Rear+Admiral+%22William+A.+Moffett%22+%22damned+fool%22&amp;amp;pg=PA40&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; American Admiral William A. Moffett, who would later embrace aviation under the Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics. And in 1943, when computers were massive room-sized objects, the chairman of IBM, Thomas Watson, &lt;a href="https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1059.htm"&gt;scoffed&lt;/a&gt; at their potential: “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xc61oj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A fairly large learning curve” from development to routine operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A5d665"&gt;Flights became commonplace. Computers became less expensive and more widely used. And at each phase of the computer’s evolution, people found new ways to use them as they became accessible to more markets and a wider swath of consumers, notes Carissa Christensen, CEO of BryceTech, a tech and space industry analytics firm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos Introduces The Blue Origin&amp;amp;nbsp;New Shepard&amp;amp;nbsp;System" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F4LxKHSsaam1Lr-EIU2AtRov63I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477954/665033922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos introduces Blue Origin’s New Shepard system in 2017&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ePAyj9"&gt;“There’s going to be a fairly large learning curve as companies go from the process of developing a capability and testing it, to operating it routinely,” Christensen said. It’s possible that space tourism will follow the same path as computers or airplanes, but there’s no guarantee that it will succeed. In part, that’s because there’s no single solution to driving down the cost of launching people to space. Virgin Galactic earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356889/virgin-galactic-unveils-new-spaceship-iii-three-3"&gt;unveiled a new version of SpaceShipTwo&lt;/a&gt; that’s tailored for quick production rates, signaling it’s gearing up to accommodate its hefty customer backlog and reopen ticket sales, which have been closed since a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7139527/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-suffers-anomaly-in-flight"&gt;fatal 2014 accident&lt;/a&gt; during a test flight. (Branson’s presence on Sunday’s flight also served as a visual reassurance to customers that the ship is safe.)  Musk is focusing on better rocket fuel efficiency with SpaceX’s Starship, a fully reusable launch system being developed to slash the cost of sending humans to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b1o8E"&gt;But again, what &lt;em&gt;exactly &lt;/em&gt;those next-generation prices will be remain a mystery. Musk hasn’t said how much it’ll cost prospective passengers to fly on Starship. And Virgin Galactic hasn’t said how much it plans to charge for tickets for its newer spaceplane, SpaceShipThree, just like Blue Origin, which hasn’t revealed its New Shepard prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="muh0wT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Keeping space tourism dreams alive while the price comes down&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bomuFZ"&gt;Currently, you either have to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309546/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-dear-moon-spacex"&gt;talented (hand-picked by a billionaire)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;lucky&lt;/a&gt; to book a ride on one of these rockets without paying the steep price tag. Raffling off tickets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572643/virgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space"&gt;like Virgin Galactic plans to do&lt;/a&gt;, and donating seats to space enthusiasts who can’t afford them keeps the public dream of normalized, low-cost space travel alive while the industry races to find the right recipe for bringing prices down. “I think that in any competitive market you’re going to see products improve and/or prices drop,” Christensen added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZWSCG"&gt;The competition has only just begun, and other companies are angling to get into space tourism. Texas-based Axiom Space has plans to build a private space station and arrange private rides on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsules. A new rocket under development by Rocket Lab, the California-based launch company that plans to go public, is designed to launch humans to space in the future. Boeing’s Starliner capsule is designed to ferry private astronauts to the space station, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OjfG8F"&gt;At the moment, there’s no telling which one will make it — if any of them do. For now, space tourism is still in a phase controlled by billionaire cash. Whether or not the industry can grow out of the spectacle and into something more mature will depend less on Bezos or Branson fulfilling their childhood dreams of flying to space and more on bringing down the cost of building rockets — and the price we pay to fly on them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No more Zoom weddings in New York after Cuomo lifts executive order</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3B2G22a3WBC-Cwe1HLrzKhXOfoU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69595132/VRG_3955_zoomweddings.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zoom weddings soared during the pandemic | Illustration by Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GyfZqn"&gt;Virtual weddings, one of the more endearing traditions to emerge during last year’s pandemic-related lockdowns, are no longer legal in New York now that Gov. Andrew Cuomo has lifted his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/18/21226544/cuomo-new-yorkers-marriage-licenses-zoom-coronavirus"&gt;April executive order&lt;/a&gt;. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/nyregion/legal-virtual-weddings-marriages.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the order Cuomo signed was meant for a state of emergency, and he rescinded the EO effective June 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLFxKJ"&gt;New York &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/4210/"&gt;state law requires&lt;/a&gt; that a couple planning to wed “must state in the presence of an authorized public official or authorized member of the clergy and at least one other witness that each takes the other as his or her spouse.” So in order to keep Zoom and other virtual weddings legal, new legislation would be necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0HYUt"&gt;Zoom weddings allowed brides and grooms to keep their wedding plans somewhat intact at the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year, providing a way for family and friends to participate in the special day while adhering to social-distancing requirements. Cuomo’s order even allowed engaged New York couples to handle the paperwork to obtain a marriage license via video under the Project Cupid program. People traveled from other states to marry in New York since it was one of the first to officially allow virtual weddings, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported, and the change in status caught many New Yorkers, including officiants, by surprise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RMagfm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Saying ‘I do’ over Zoom","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202466/zoom-wedding-coronavirus-covid-19-social-distance"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6RgJs0"&gt;The governor’s office told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that the state wasn’t stopping people “from livestreaming a safe trip to City Hall or your clergy’s office.” The city’s Marriage Bureau in Manhattan, which closed last March amid lockdowns, is still closed to walk-in weddings, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; noted. However, New York City Mayor &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/nyc-marriage-bureau-to-reopen-monday-after-march-2020-closing?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Bill de Blasio said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that the Marriage Bureau would be reopening on July 19th, and couples will be able to schedule wedding appointments as soon as July 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9U2uVN"&gt; “It’s the summer of New York City,” de Blasio said during the announcement. “A lot of people are going to experience amazing things here, why not get married?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California legislature approves ‘historic’ broadband internet bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cQ2SzxbCkeOp_rPCIdLpmRdsd7g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69595058/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qKqIMj"&gt;California’s legislature has voted unanimously to approve a $6 billion plan to build a statewide open access fiber network (h/t &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/california-passes-historic-plan-for-statewide-open-access-fiber-network/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ArsTechnica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The state will provide $3.25 billion to hire a third party to build and maintain a so-called “middle-mile” network, which won’t bring internet directly from backbone infrastructure to customers, but rather to connection points, leaving the last mile to be handled by internet service providers (ISPs). The legislation provides $2 billion for last-mile infrastructure lines to connect residences and businesses to local networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tay81R"&gt;Making the middle-mile network open access will allow “non-discriminatory access to eligible entities on a technology and competitively neutral basis, regardless of whether the entity is privately or publicly owned,” the bill states. The middle-mile plan prioritizes areas underserved by current internet options; areas with no residential access to download speeds of 25Mbps and upload speeds of 3Mbps would be targeted first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGgyw7"&gt;Under the plan, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will “identify priority statewide open-access middle-mile broadband network locations, including areas that can be built expeditiously, areas with no known middle-mile network access, regions underserved by middle-mile networks, and regions without sufficient capacity to meet future middle-mile needs,” according to the text of the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MImA3X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FqouvO"&gt;“Every Republican and Democrat in Sacramento just voted for a fiber for all future,” Ernesto Falcon of the Electronic Frontier Foundation &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EFFFalcon/status/1415747447473664001"&gt;tweeted Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOpOJR"&gt;Gov. Gavin Newsom called the bill “historic” for California. “This legislation will yield vital, broadened access for California families by prioritizing the unserved and underserved areas, facilities, households, and businesses that remain disconnected in the digital era,” he said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/12/governor-newsom-legislative-leaders-announce-historic-broadband-budget-bill/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday. He’s expected to sign the bill. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s Xperia 1 III is pricey, performant, and perplexing</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good camera system and top-notch features, but it’s priced too high to recommend&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dfjjAK"&gt;The Sony Xperia 1 III is a great phone that I won’t recommend to many people. Once again, Sony has created a beautiful device with some unique, marquee features like a 4K-ish OLED 120Hz screen, great photo-taking amenities like a physical shutter button and a high-quality manual camera app, and top-notch hardware for entertainment consumption, like dual front-facing speakers and an honest-to-god headphone jack. You won’t find that combination among the other big-name flagships on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCxImC"&gt;But reader, it is $1,300. That’s a $100 increase over last year’s model, and more than an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; ($1,199) or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; ($1,249, but often on sale for less) with an equivalent 256GB of storage. That is simply a lot to ask someone to pay for a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d6JQED"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10655594"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5jQQEl"&gt;For that $1,300, you get a top-notch experience on basically every level (except for its relatively short security-support timeline), but I struggle to see any one way in which it sets itself apart from the established competition. There are serious photo and video recording capabilities within the native camera apps, but nothing that could be considered unique to Xperia or a must-have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9gD3D"&gt;It all amounts to a very expensive device that does a lot of things well, but without a strong value proposition for any one kind of person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 6.5-inch OLED offers a fast 120Hz refresh rate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40QEc54OgGSoyHWpbJVK_9DltRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721851/ajohnson_210712_4667_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED offers a fast 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sEOx0N"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III screen, battery, and ergonomics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="togdaC"&gt;The Xperia 1 III’s screen stands out among its fellow flagships both in terms of its slimmer 21:9 aspect ratio and its higher 1644 x 3840 resolution, which Sony calls 4K (it’s close). It’s also an OLED panel, and this year’s version offers a 120Hz maximum refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rozvbw"&gt;There’s no variability, unfortunately, so you’ll need to choose between locking it in at a standard 60Hz (the default) or that higher 120Hz rate for the smoothest of smooth scrolling experiences. Opting for 120Hz comes with a warning that the battery will drain faster, and it does, but not unreasonably so. I kept it enabled throughout my time using the phone. Overall, it’s a lovely screen, with a couple of notes: Auto brightness is sometimes a little squirrely indoors, and the panel itself doesn’t get terribly bright outdoors. It’s still usable outside in bright light, but it can feel like a strain to see what’s on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6oFm7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;Dieter was a fan of the Xperia 1 II’s look when he reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m in agreement about the III: it’s a sophisticated, understated design and I dig it. I like the slight matte treatment for the back panel glass, and all-around build quality (including its IP65/68 durability rating) measures up to the flagship class with a metal frame and Gorilla Glass Victus on the front. The Sony branding is so unobtrusive it practically disappears into the back panel, until the light catches it, and the whole thing looks at home next to an RX100 series camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DgBdAZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImnDmd"&gt;The Xperia 1 III gets an upgraded 4,500mAh battery compared to the previous-gen’s 4,000mAh, likely a necessary move given the 120Hz display. Battery life is adequate, not stellar. I averaged two hours of screen time on a day of lighter use, which drained the cell to only about 50 percent by the end of the day. I was concerned about how it would hold up on a day of heavier use recording some 4K video clips, but even in that case, the battery lasted through the end of the day. I’d pack a charger or a backup if I planned on shooting video extensively, or on a long travel day where I anticipated more than four hours of screen-on time, but for day-in-day-out use, the Xperia 1 III does fine. There’s also support for 30W wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJX0hJ"&gt;I both like and dislike the phone’s unique tall-and-slim profile. It fits my hand more easily, and it is possible to reach your thumb across the screen in one-handed use (forget about reaching the far upper corner, though). But it’s also more prone to slipping out of pockets. I do like the fingerprint sensor embedded in the on / off button on the side; it’s quick and it doesn’t care if I’m wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9MHt9B"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III performance and software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="f95l9Q"&gt;Spec-wise, the Xperia 1 III is a flagship through and through. It uses a Snapdragon 888 processor with 12GB RAM and 256GB of built-in storage. There’s 5G connectivity here, and unlike last year’s model, those in the US will be able to take advantage of it — as long as you’re on Verizon or T-Mobile. The Xperia 1 III doesn’t support AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G, and there’s no mmWave support, just sub-6GHz on T-Mobile and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FxIJz"&gt;Sony doesn’t have a firm security-support timeline for the Xperia 1 III but tells us that owners can expect two years of support. The phone ships with Android 11, and the company doesn’t have plans for future OS version upgrades. That puts it well behind Samsung’s and Apple’s support policies, both of which offer at least four years of security updates and multiple OS version upgrades. Considering its high price tag, this is a significant shortcoming against its peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgTU1v"&gt;Sony has equipped the Xperia 1 III with dual front-firing speakers and says they’re louder than those in the 1 II. Paired with the high-res OLED screen, it makes watching videos a high-quality experience. I was delighted when I heard a car offscreen and the audio tracked as it passed through the scene from the left to right speakers. Maybe I’m easily impressed by these things, but I can see myself genuinely enjoying watching a movie or a show on the Xperia 1 III, rather than as a last resort to stave off boredom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Xperia’s rear panel includes three cameras and a time-of-flight sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXKsDD5HelikwPsT6w2NkRxN1Y4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721853/ajohnson_210712_4667_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia’s rear panel includes three cameras and a time-of-flight sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KiwB8t"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gr0Vh8"&gt;Sony is a highly regarded maker of mobile imaging sensors, and in the past few years has gotten more serious about the camera hardware in its own Xperia phones. This year’s iteration includes a total of three 12-megapixel rear-facing cameras, including a telephoto lens with a folded-optic design that includes two focal lengths: 70mm and 105mm equivalents. All three cameras, including that telephoto unit, use a sensor with dual phase-detection autofocus, a technology that helps Sony Alpha cameras achieve class-leading autofocus speeds. If you’re a numbers kind of person, here’s the quick rundown on the rear-facing camera hardware in the Xperia 1 III:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ifAERS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10655682"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idAAgP"&gt;The Xperia’s Photography Pro camera app now includes a “basic,” auto-everything shooting mode as the default. Switching over to one of the semi-auto or manual modes brings up an interface resembling an Alpha camera’s quick menu. The basic mode is refreshingly minimal — there are quick shortcuts to different focal lengths, to turn bokeh mode on or off, enable continuous shooting, and access flash settings, but not much more than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCrGBF"&gt;Manual modes introduce a lot more control and more display options like a big, beautiful (to me, at least) horizon level. It will all feel very familiar to anyone who’s used a conventional camera, especially if that camera is a Sony. I like both the basic and advanced shooting mode experiences, and a two-stage shutter button is a very welcome addition, but my one complaint is that there’s no real on-screen indication when a photo is taken. I live with all of my phone’s notifications and audio signals on mute, so without the audio cue, I missed it when I only half-pressed the shutter on a few occasions, thinking I’d fully pressed it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U74oaP"&gt;I’ll admit that it took a minute for me to warm up to the Xperia’s telephoto camera. I tend to like a wider lens, and I’ve used too many bad or mediocre smartphone telephoto cameras to get too excited about them. But once I started trusting it — especially at the 70mm focal length — I started to really enjoy using it to layer foreground and background elements, or bring more attention to a subject I can’t get closer to. You know, stuff you use a telephoto lens for. The image quality won’t put your dedicated zoom lens out of work, but it’s good enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnARwU"&gt;There’s a tendency for smartphone telephoto lenses to just amplify the shortcomings of the small-sensor-small-lens combo working to create them, which manifests as ugly purple fringing or obviously smeary details. The images I took at 70mm are blessedly free from these artifacts, especially if you’re looking at them at social media sizes. The 105mm focal length starts to look a little artifact-y, and details are noticeably soft, but as long as there’s plenty of light, images don’t look distractingly bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u7gKYP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10655721"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cN5UIu"&gt;That’s the good stuff. I’m a little less excited about one of the other marquee camera features on the Xperia: autofocus. Namely, Sony’s dual phase-detect and tracking AF technologies, which it has imported to the Xperia series from its Alpha range. Don’t get me wrong, Sony autofocus is amazing. It’s why I own a Sony camera. You can see it at work in the Xperia 1 III when it effortlessly identifies a human or animal subject and tracks it around a scene, keeping up even when the subject turns away or becomes obscured behind something else. I’m just not convinced that it does much good here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7beOL"&gt;First, it seems to contribute to some distracting autofocus fluttering between near and distant subjects in some situations with the telephoto lens. Combined with the inherently less stable ergonomics of taking pictures with a phone versus a dedicated camera, it can make for a real challenge trying to get a photo of something in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMlzUT"&gt;Taking closer-range photos of moving kids and pets in dim conditions is probably a more common use case for many people, and it’s one that no phone manufacturer has been able to crack just yet — including Sony. In these situations, dual phase-detect will keep up with your subject, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get a sharp shot. Just like every other phone camera system, it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics. Situations where there’s just not enough available light to keep shutter speed high enough will still result in some blur, no matter how well the subject tracking is keeping up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bIKqBG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just like every other phone camera system, it’s bound by the laws of small-sensor-small-lens physics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lurjns"&gt;In very low light, the camera will assemble data from multiple frames to create a brighter, less noisy image. This actually happens automatically in darker conditions, and doesn’t require a trip to a separate night mode, which I appreciate. But it does require you to hold the camera steady for a second or two, and isn’t well suited for moving subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQg3aa"&gt;Sony has included a darn good camera system on the Xperia 1 III, and it’s one I enjoyed using. I got to flex some creativity that I’d normally avoid with a smartphone and reserve for when I have a dedicated camera on hand. But it hasn’t found a way yet to bend the laws of optics and physics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sEq1s"&gt;We noted in our Xperia 1 II review that rather than leaning into computational photography the way Apple and Google have, Sony seems to be leaning into its traditional camera chops, applying the technology that has pushed the company’s mirrorless cameras to the top of the game. That approach has paid off in some ways — a great native camera app, a surprisingly good telephoto lens — but it doesn’t always translate, and I’m not sure how much further Sony can take that approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QSr8BE"&gt;Sony Xperia 1 III video recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JoT4PE"&gt;The Xperia 1 III is also well equipped for the serious mobile video shooter, with up to 4K / 60p recording and a native video app that includes plenty of manual control over video settings. You can set shutter angle, manually set points for pull focus, and apply one of Sony’s pro-video-esque color profiles. I have no problem telling you that this was all way over my head, but I played with it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utMOBC"&gt;Your video files are associated with projects, and certain parameters like frame rate are preserved from clip to clip within a project. You also have the choice of recording to internal storage or directly to a microSD card if you don’t want to burn up your storage space with 4K video files. I’m happy to report that the SIM tray where the microSD card slot lives simply pops out of the side of the device, so you won’t have to hunt down a safety pin every time you want to grab your card to transfer files. That’s a nice touch, especially if you’re going to be taking that card out often to transfer footage to a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony’s Cinematography Pro app offers plenty of manual control and the ability to set points for pull focus." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h24D8LTqCd5810QQd_drApEhcN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722485/Screenshot_20210714_122747.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s Cinematography Pro app offers plenty of manual control and the ability to set points for pull focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1x1d09"&gt;There’s not much you can do in the way of editing files — you can trim them or grab a still frame — so they’ll need to be exported for anything more than that. It’s also possible to use the Xperia 1 III as an external monitor for video recording with a dedicated camera (doesn’t need to be a Sony), or to use it for live-streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFhbYh"&gt;This is all much more robust than any native video-recording options you’ll find on a Samsung, Google, or Apple flagship. For someone who’s entrenched in the Alpha camera ecosystem, it could make sense as a compact, lightweight option for recording clips, or as part of a live-streaming setup. But there are also strong third-party apps and accessory options for mobile video shooters, especially those using iOS, that have benefited from years of development and use in the field. While the Xperia packs more of this into its native app experience, it’s not exactly a unique proposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qTmg7XSGoePrqQ6MrvdlJjeJPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721849/ajohnson_210712_4667_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia 1 III doesn’t offer enough above and beyond the established flagships to justify its high cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="q9JTBb"&gt;In the Xperia 1 III, Sony has created a sophisticated device that both looks good and delivers flagship-level performance. It offers sophisticated camera hardware and software and a lovely high-resolution OLED that’s not quite like anything else in its class. And yet I’m struggling to think of anyone who should buy this phone over an iPhone 12 Pro Max or a Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H41KPh"&gt;There’s the basics: for $1,300, you’d be getting a device that’s likely to only see a couple of years of security updates. And if you’re on AT&amp;amp;T, you’re paying top dollar for a 5G device that can’t access the carrier’s 5G network. It’s hard to make a case for the Xperia just based on those facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MvGfsc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uEnGxD"&gt;But suppose you plan on trading in your phone in a couple of years anyway, and you’re not on AT&amp;amp;T or don’t care about 5G (still a reasonable response to have toward 5G right now). The Xperia 1 III will deliver a very good picture-taking experience with camera hardware as good as anything else out there right now. You’ll get a great entertainment consumption device, with good audio and a lovely screen. And if you’re interested in shooting video, you’ll have a powerful tool in your hands right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rg4v1c"&gt;But none of these features go far enough above and beyond what you can get with an iPhone or Galaxy flagship to make the Xperia stand out. Factor in the shorter time frame for device support and uncertainty of any OS platform updates, and things just don’t add up in the Xperia 1 III’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Andrew Marino? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m5pbHhWmtOiGuPT5B_2eMzu-HzI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69594833/amarino_210711_4666_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Marino / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A cornucopia of audio tech spread across two desks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Cpe9jO"&gt;Podcasting can be a fun and incredibly creative field — but also a very demanding one. Your skill set not only has to include familiarity with a variety of audio hardware and software, but you also need imagination, a good feel for what will sound good to your audience, and a very sensitive ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uX3ME"&gt;Andrew Marino is &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s senior audio director, and is responsible for producing almost everything you hear in our podcasts. We asked him to show us his desks — both of them — and tell us a bit about them, and about himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPsPrE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DD0QUt"&gt;Hello! I am an audio engineer / creator living in Brooklyn, NY. My background is mostly in audio / visual technology, whether that is making music, podcasting, video producing, or playing with fun media formats. That is not so coincidentally what I do at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YowNY"&gt;Most of my job is producing, editing, mixing, and recording audio for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; podcasts and videos, and I try to write on the site when I can! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NxyuP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have two — count &lt;/strong&gt;’&lt;strong&gt;em, two — separate workspaces. Where are they and what are they for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53PQhA"&gt;Yes! I am very lucky to have two workspaces. The smaller desk is in my living room, and the larger corner one is in my bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRqq1g"&gt;The living room has been where I’ve set up a desktop for the past five years in my apartment, but while working from home the past year, I decided to separate my work into two spaces: the one in the living room for most &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; stuff during the week, and then the other for personal projects like my Etsy store, Twitch stream, personal blog, or podcast. Or sometimes I’ll work there when I need some kind of change of scenery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A corner desk in the bedroom for personal audio projects." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6fPAktcqdfQ9Nsg5PdRbAynlzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22722120/amarino_210710_4666_0001_2_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A corner desk in the bedroom for personal audio projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6xpNk2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with your personal desk in the bedroom. It looks like it’s got a complete sound setup. How did you decide where and how to set it up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qk2He"&gt;I wouldn’t say it’s &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; — you may notice I don’t have any studio monitors at either desk. I work on headphones in my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnbPhu"&gt;I’ve had that corner desk for a long time, and I really didn’t want to throw it out when I got a new desk (the one in the living room). I also was trying to set up a separate space for Twitch or my Etsy shop where I didn’t have to make a mess and move stuff around all the time for different projects, like I have to with my &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnmZ7G"&gt;There’s also something nice about moving to another room to work on a different project, and that has helped a lot with productivity and creativity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCczoG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmAXmz"&gt;This was a desk someone in my hometown was getting rid of many years ago — I still keep it around because of the L shape. I like to have a lot of space for different projects and tools I’m using so I can access them quickly. My &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues may see a pattern here with my desk in our office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IohHNW"&gt;I also took a shelf from another old desk and screwed it onto this one — that’s where I put my cassette decks or can mount some other gear if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIc45k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a desk chair for that one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynz25l"&gt;Oh, yeah, I do. It’s a 50 dollar computer chair I got from Ikea. It’s comfy enough, but I wouldn’t really recommend it because the material of the chair comes off very easily, so there was black plasticky stuff on my floor all the time. I had to put pillowcases on the top and bottom of it. It’s ugly so I didn’t include it in the photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viQ09x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s go for the gold: could you tell us about the tech you’re using there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJMdNA"&gt;All right. The essentials of this setup are a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacbook-pro%2F&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; (a 2014 or a 2020 model, depending on if I’m using my personal or work computer), a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-U2414H-Screen-Monitor/dp/B00GTV05XG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;24-inch U2414H Dell monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sweetwater.com%2Fstore%2Fdetail%2FRodecasterPro--rode-rodecaster-pro-podcast-production-studio&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rodecaster Pro mixer / audio interface&lt;/a&gt;, and the traditional Apple keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xeM994"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654100"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXozA8"&gt;The Rodecaster Pro is the cool gadget I’d like to point out here. It’s a consumer audio mixer by Rode built for podcasting and live audio, with the ability to mix and record up to four microphones, device audio, and sound banks. I prefer to use it for live mixing rather than recording — it makes it really easy to mix multiple microphones and sound sources into one signal for streaming for live video before it even hits the computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGZKGh"&gt;Everything else are tools for different projects: an old Panasonic VHS-C video camera for a streaming webcam, a few cassette decks for making mixtapes, arts and crafts materials, and several recording devices (a &lt;a href="https://www.sounddevices.com/product/mixpre-6-ii/"&gt;Sound Devices Mix-Pre 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-H4N-Digital-Multitrack-Recorder/dp/B01DPOXS8I?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom H4n&lt;/a&gt;, a PreSonus FireStudio, and some lavalier microphones) for recording in the field. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feed from the Panasonic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApyPxy"&gt;The big bin under my desk is completely blank cassette tapes for my online store. I have been putting my podcasts on cassettes and also make custom designs and labels for mixtapes. The other bin with drawers is all arts and crafts and office supplies — markers, stickers, paper, shipping supplies, stamps, paper glue, device cables, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwHgSg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Um — tape cassettes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jG9uyo"&gt;Honestly, it’s more aesthetic than anything (ha ha). It’s also easy and cheap to make duplications and personalize a physical piece of media. You see it a lot in DIY music spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6A9QQs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the photo of the hippo above your desk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93AOoe"&gt;That article (which is actually in an old Wharfedale picture-frame speaker) is about the oldest hippopotamus in America, named Lucifer. My grandma sent me &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/hernando/lucifer-americas-oldest-hippo-confronts-his-age-in-homosassa-springs-20190214/"&gt;that article&lt;/a&gt; a couple years ago because I used to visit him as a kid. I recently did a little story about him &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5wMHySfoXwLzEmLIQ1R2Gu?si=89035e5b073d4e52&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;on my personal podcast&lt;/a&gt; that I’m proud of, so it is sort of a memento to that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y17T8W"&gt;That little orange thing on the edge of the desk is a vintage tabletop vacuum that I found very pleasantly designed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IEsEH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see that you’re set up with some sound-absorbing material.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTeEHp"&gt;Oh yeah, it’s not set up very well, and I’m kind of embarrassed by it. But I could not stand the low-end reverberation of my voice in that corner, so I had to add something pretty simple to dampen the sound bouncing off those walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ4J4y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the toys. I was especially drawn to the Crayola toy. What is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqY9Va"&gt;It’s a tape player! It was a gift from a friend. I use it half for testing out cassette tapes and half to just look at. There is a crayon-shaped microphone you can record with. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The living room desk is for Verge work." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcikLnR4PYggUctKYxFsbIapsCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717393/amarino_210712_4666_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The living room desk is for Verge work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B6S1fy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s pass on to the smaller desk. Can you tell us about the desk and the pink chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpxYOA"&gt;This is where I do most of my work for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and this is where you will see me sitting on our work Zoom calls 90 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpTwK1"&gt;This was also a desk that someone was giving away. It’s a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FHusky-46-in-Adjustable-Height-Work-Table-HOLT46XDB12%2F301809931&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Husky adjustable work table&lt;/a&gt; and it works great as a standing computer desk. I’d recommend this if you’re looking for an affordable option for a standing desk. It has a very slow hand crank to adjust height, but I eventually got used to it and my arms are more buff now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEV9Hi"&gt;The chair is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkarljan-chair-turquoise-kabusa-turquoise-40497060%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Karljan&lt;/a&gt; from Ikea, and good for the price! I initially bought this as a kitchen chair, but moved it over in the living room once I got the second desk. In general, I try not to sit for too long during the day, so I guess I don’t care too much about chairs. Maybe that’s just because I don’t own a “good” chair. This one’s cute, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUidz8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the device you have between the keyboard and the monitor? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LA0rA"&gt;It’s an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Akai-Professional-MPK-Performance-Ready-8-Assignable/dp/B00IJ6QAO2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Akai MPK mini MIDI controller&lt;/a&gt; I use for music production, mostly in &lt;a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/"&gt;Ableton Live&lt;/a&gt;, a digital audio workstation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWfz6D"&gt;Once in a while I will make something for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; podcasts or videos with it. Other times it is on the carpet next to me when the desk gets too full. I’ve been working on the desk space issue forever. I’m still trying to figure out how to keep a minimalist desk in my living room, but it keeps growing. I’m a maximalist, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lAFrBs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654118"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKkOBb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the other tech on this desk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYAR7D"&gt;Again, I switch MacBooks back and forth between desks, so the classic MacBook Pro for all my work is here too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YeO28"&gt;For the other gear, I’ve got a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Scarlett-Audio-Interface-Tools/dp/B07QR73T66?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Focusrite Scarlett 2i2&lt;/a&gt; USB audio interface, which I use mostly to plug in a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-MKE600-Camcorder-Shotgun-Microphone/dp/B00B0YPAYQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser MKE 600 shotgun mic&lt;/a&gt; for Zoom calls, or for the rare occasion I need to record myself at work. Our podcast hosts have been using the Scarlett for recording at home this past year. This Sennheiser model has been the clearest, most directional, and most non-bulky option for voice chat I’ve used (you will also see this mic at my other desk), and I’ve used a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of microphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw5hV8"&gt;My main screen is a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-32MP58HQ-P-32-Inch-Monitor-Screen/dp/B01BV1X9DG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32-inch LG 32MP58HQ-P LED monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which is big but I love it. I was trying to mimic an iMac-size screen initially, then went a little bigger. Editing a podcast on a screen this big makes it so much easier to navigate through a project. I have the monitor stacked on a book right now to put it at eye level, but I think I’m going to have to find a way to raise it up a bit more. I actually loved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22395531/remote-work-desk-setup-from-home-office-tech"&gt;Dan’s monitor arm from his version of this desk chat&lt;/a&gt;, I might have to get one myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IV1TgR"&gt;I use the MacBook as a second monitor for my mixer window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlg8xp"&gt;I keep my external &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746376143951711557" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Ultra HD Blu-ray drive&lt;/a&gt; on this desk to burn or read discs. This is an overspill gadget from my bedroom desk because it is kind of delicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPTDtx"&gt;Depending on the computer, I have some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22278012/dongle-quiz-tech-gadgets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dongles&lt;/a&gt;. For the 2014 MacBook Pro, I just use an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-4-Port-Macbook-Surface-Notebook/dp/B00XMD7KPU?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker 4-port USB-A dock&lt;/a&gt; for various devices I’m plugging in. For the 2020 MacBook Pro, I’m using a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Aluminum-Multi-Port-Adapter-Pass-Through/dp/B075FW7H5J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Satechi USB-C dock&lt;/a&gt; that gets everything I need into my computer — except a Thunderbolt 2 cable for my hard drives and video interfaces, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMMEL2AM%2FA%2Fthunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which I have to use another dongle&lt;/a&gt; for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QxkM9P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654127"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5IaikH"&gt;I’ve been using the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fwebcams%2Fc270-hd-webcam.960-000694.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C270&lt;/a&gt; as my Zoom webcam, because it was the only one available at the time I needed it last year. It is in 720p and 4:3 aspect ratio, which is kind of charming at times but it looks like I’m using a mini DVD camera for my meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lLgBE"&gt;Then, once in a while, I bring in my Magnavox MWR20V6 VCR / DVD combo from the bedroom when I need to digitize something or convert media formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPyKLj"&gt;The orange things on the corner of my desk are my &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1388898-REG%2Flacie_stfr5000800_rugged_5tb_portable_hdd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577580%2Fwhats-on-your-desk-andrew-marino" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LaCie external hard drives&lt;/a&gt;, where I keep all the digital projects I’m currently working on, and some archival projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cad3aW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, there’s no way I’m not asking you about that cat on the wall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvplcc"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fb-toys-interactive-cat-piano-meowsic%2F-%2FA-12026417&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cat piano&lt;/a&gt;!! I got this at Target about seven or eight years ago because it was so wacky and you can play cat meows on it with the keys. I added a quarter-inch TRS analog output on it so I can record it directly, but it is mostly decoration these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A cheerful cat piano." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MdMkih4l9j55P3JU-xQvSZA47_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717394/amarino_210712_4666_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cheerful cat piano.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Why is the skull made out of broccoli?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D2mETvDIkgj7BBxgCXI6MNpWNXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717398/amarino_210712_4666_0031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is the skull made out of broccoli?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7g6Qbm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the Star Wars mug. And the green skull ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgAgOw"&gt;Oh, thanks! Yeah, you gotta have a mug with tools in it. That Star Wars mug was a gift my great-grandma’s neighbor gave me as a kid after my great-grandma died. I always thought it was a weird thing to give a grieving child, so it has taken on some meaning after all these years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeBsnk"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ebros-Vegetable-Sprouting-Halloween-Decorative/dp/B084KRC4GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;broccoli skull&lt;/a&gt; is something I bought at Wayfair a couple months ago because it was also a weird thing! Why broccoli? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTgju4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else about your workspace that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2qnLN"&gt;I would like to note that I don’t take cable management too seriously, and it is sometimes overrated, especially when you are moving gear around a lot! I tried to keep these images authentic and not over-tidy my setup for this piece. Also, I am currently working on an art project to make unruly cables look good in your home — more on that at a later time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfphEv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Google Nest Hub&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVmnTU"&gt;Though we’re hitting the sleepy, dog-days of summer and there aren’t any big sale events on the horizon, there are still plenty of great deals out there if you know where to look. This week we found bargains on bundles of Google’s Nest Hub and Nest Thermostat, HyperX’s excellent gaming headset, the best Chromebook you can get right now, and Amazon’s kids-focused Fire HD tablets. Check them out below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3Fu3wO"&gt;
&lt;p id="xXdCYa"&gt;For a limited time, you can pick up a Google Nest Hub (second-gen) and a budget-friendly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; for $167 through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/324687194939/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/13/22574503/google-nest-hub-best-buy-philips-hue-smart-bulbs-amazon-fire-deal-sale&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22338544__t_w__r_theverge.com/good-deals_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig’s official storefront&lt;/a&gt; on eBay. If you prefer a smart speaker over a thermostat, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/313593807202/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/13/22574503/google-nest-hub-best-buy-philips-hue-smart-bulbs-amazon-fire-deal-sale&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22338544__t_w__r_theverge.com/good-deals_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig is also offering&lt;/a&gt; the same Hub model with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for $140, more than $100 off what they would cost if you were to purchase them separately. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tGsXGk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDnaD3"&gt;If you’re new to the whole gaming thing, you might want to consider picking up a capable headset before jumping into competitive play. Thankfully, everything in HyperX’s headset lineup is consistently reliable, with the Cloud Alpha S being a solid choice for those looking for clean sound, comfort, and a subtle look that should mesh well with just about anything. Right now, the jet black model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Alpha-Adjustable-Leatherette/dp/B081D8TPZZ/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22339428%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $90&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching the best price we’ve seen on the wired headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21191577/hyperx-cloud-alpha-s-gaming-headset-black-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b0DwPw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650572"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A9PdCE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746320001237385626#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22341856%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently discounted at Best Buy to $619&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 Chromebook Spin 713 from Acer packs in 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i5, which is more than enough processing power for most people. Moreover, it boasts a great keyboard and a brilliant 3:2 screen, along with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and enough battery life for a full day in the classroom — virtual or otherwise. It’s the best Chromebook you can get right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kb8AeX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10652856"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gSogHf"&gt;The top-tier 10-inch Fire HD 10 Kids tablet, which was just updated earlier this year, includes a bigger, better-quality screen, faster performance and more RAM, and up to 12 hours of battery life with USB-C charging. Normally $200, but this week’s sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F62DV1Z?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22337565%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brings it down to $130&lt;/a&gt;. Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review of the full Fire HD 10 2021 lineup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHDk2T"&gt;If you want something smaller or a little cheaper, the Fire HD 8 Kids is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Edition-tablet/dp/B07WDDT3G5?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22337565%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $90&lt;/a&gt;, while the base model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H8WS1FT?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22337565%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire 7 Kids is down to $60&lt;/a&gt;. All versions come with a kid-friendly case, two-year damage protection, and a year subscription to Amazon’s Kids Plus content service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IXut3u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJPgxS"&gt;Before you go, here are a few more deals we thought were significant this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="E8iykG"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13697508?url=https://sellout.woot.com/offers/echo-dot-3rd-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa-38?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s third-gen Echo Dot is on sale at Woot for $25&lt;/a&gt;, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the last-gen Echo device outside of Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp tests encrypted cloud backups on Android</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OFGgCM"&gt;When you’re using WhatsApp your messages are encrypted end-to-end, which means prying eyes can’t easily see what’s in them as they travel back and forth. However, if you keep a backup stored in the cloud, authorities can use a search warrant to have Google Drive or iCloud hand over access to the data. But &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has reported previously that WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319136/whatsapp-cloud-backups-icloud-google-drive-password-encryption-security"&gt;working on the technology to independently encrypt your backups in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-15-5-whats-new/"&gt;says that in the most recent beta update on Android&lt;/a&gt; (2.21.15.5), the system has been enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="h9idD6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What 2020 means for encryption","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21158030/encryption-explainer-guide-law-enforcement-apple-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JguQDj"&gt;Opting in should keep your chat history and media securely backed up, with the significant caveat that if you forget your passcode / lose the 64-digit recovery key, then they’ll be locked away permanently — even WhatsApp can’t help you get in. If you’re OK with being on your own in that respect, then all you need to do is get in the beta test group or wait for this to be available to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uevkWP"&gt;The Facebook-owned service is also testing a version of the software that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577594/whatsapp-multi-device-e2e-facebook"&gt;works across multiple devices&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining end-to-end encryption whether or not you have a phone involved. If you’re in the beta, check your version carefully, as posts on social media suggest the closed encryption tests are expanding to include more people.&lt;/p&gt;
