    <title>Windows 10 is getting new File Explorer icons as part of a visual overhaul</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0xKOs9nyVaClNWKhxLRMKgMKPCg=/0x2:1936x1293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018986/file_explorer_icons.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IfEGl7"&gt;Microsoft is giving the File Explorer inside Windows 10 a visual overhaul with new icons. The software giant has started rolling out a test build of Windows 10 that includes changes to the system icons you’ll find in File Explorer, including the Recycle Bin, Documents folders, and devices like disk drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVGuA6"&gt;“Several changes, such as the orientation of the folder icons and the default file type icons, have been made for greater consistency across Microsoft products that show files,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/03/24/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21343/"&gt;says  Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s Windows Insider chief. “Notably, the top-level user folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and Pictures have a new design that should make it a little easier to tell them apart at a glance.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwxRmtBGS4E4Fw1aGC4wVzbIDz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394605/DriveAndRecycle_2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Recycle Bin icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VqlJGz"&gt;Perhaps daringly, Microsoft also notes that “and yes, the Recycle Bin icon has also been updated!” — a clear nod to some changes the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/23/8089387/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons"&gt;tried to make to the Recycle Bin&lt;/a&gt; in the past that didn’t go down well with Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RF9Xxc"&gt;These icon changes are fairly minor in the grand scheme of Windows, but they’re part of a broader effort inside Microsoft to modernize Windows. Microsoft unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10 earlier this month, and the company previously updated some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; last year with colorful versions and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310597/microsoft-windows-10-start-menu-design-new-alt-tab-features"&gt;tweaked the Start menu&lt;/a&gt; to make it more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CZLVTuCe78aY8ZO1zQ1YgW538c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394581/Pictures_Folder_2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new File Explorer icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Stqbvh"&gt;Microsoft is also planning a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” codenamed “Sun Valley.” The company is expected to detail its visual plans and more about the future of Windows in the coming months as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;dedicated news event&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEDMGh"&gt;The icon updates will arrive alongside some tweaks to the layout of File Explorer, too. Microsoft is adding additional padding between elements in File Explorer, and there will be a compact mode to return to the classic File Explorer mode. The updated view is a little more touch-optimized and complements the new icons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo made a tool to help you show off your Animal Crossing island</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qU0M6y1oDJ47cIh1JYyCNUXbyg=/0x174:1123x923/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018885/IMG_0420.5.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gs0uio"&gt;Nintendo has a new tool that lets show off your &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; island with a poster or even a trailer. While you’ve always been able to take screenshots and video clips from the game using the Switch’s built-in tools and share those with your friends and on social media, the new Island Tour Creator lets you add some &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;-themed flair to what you’ve captured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JQnbq"&gt;Nintendo made an example island tour video &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1374707642556375040"&gt;in this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a voiceover and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/15/21259948/animal-crossing-new-horizons-theme-song-nintendo-virtual-performance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ iconic theme song&lt;/a&gt;, and the trailers you make will have them, too, which I thought was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xzSnXf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;[Announcement]&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimalCrossing&lt;/a&gt;: New Horizons Island Tour Creator website is now available! Show off your island by creating fun posters and videos with content captured on your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt;. Here's just one example, featuring Ninten Island!&lt;a href="https://t.co/mYxkogv0xu"&gt;https://t.co/mYxkogv0xu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ehxaS7UmQJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ehxaS7UmQJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Isabelle (@animalcrossing) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1374707642556375040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ReAsn"&gt;And here’s a poster I made for my island, Hoopla: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AjYNT0izDLNLYMuaXG_RM5pFDaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394385/IMG_0419.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fyqoVG"&gt;To use the Island Tour Creator, which only works on mobile, visit &lt;a href="https://www.tanuki-kaihatsu.com/en_US/index.html"&gt;this link on your smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. From there, you’ll be asked to log in to your Nintendo account, and after a brief chat with Tom Nook, you’ll be able to pick between making a poster or a trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0IHJD"&gt;You can use media taken from the game that you’ve saved to your phone or posted to Twitter, and both the poster- and trailer-making tools have lots of customization options. I really wish you could use the Island Tour Creator in-game in some way, though, since getting screenshots and video from my Switch to my iPhone is a bit of a hassle. But once I had everything I wanted saved on my phone, using the tool was straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IiQQL4qNm-7zCRredUIdCad2HhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394346/IMG_0416.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Island Tour Creator interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L825FC"&gt;Now that people have had their hands on &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22327659/animal-crossing-new-horizons-first-year-timeline-events-holidays"&gt;more than a year&lt;/a&gt;, I’m looking forward to seeing the virtual tours and posters people create to show off their islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5E3lZy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ first year: a timeline","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22327659/animal-crossing-new-horizons-first-year-timeline-events-holidays"},{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons review: one year later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"},{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ anniversary","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334355/animal-crossing-new-horizons-one-year-anniversary-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>LG’s brightest OLED TV ever starts at $2,200</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLNwgHTqL4ohxW4uVFrvbiAu7Wc=/0x0:1101x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018857/LG_OLED_evo_Wall_Mount.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dlnvhs"&gt;LG today announced the pricing for its 2021 lineup of 4K OLED TVs. The most buzz-worthy part for home theater enthusiasts is the new G1 series, which includes LG’s new “OLED evo” panel with a brighter picture than any of the company’s past OLEDs. But the G1 doesn’t come cheap: it’s $2,199 for a 55-inch model, $2,999 for a 65-inch, and $4,499 if you want a 77-inch screen. LG says the G1 sets also “have an unbelievably thin bezel with included wall mounting leaving virtually no gap from screen to wall.” You’re paying for both the superior picture and that gallery-like aesthetic here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZArqJo"&gt;Stepping down from the G1, you get the C1 series, which succeeds last year’s highly praised CX series. All sizes of the C1 TVs still come with the full suite of HDMI 2.1 features (4K at 120Hz, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, and eARC), and you get four HDMI ports with those capabilities. On the subject of gaming, this year’s LG TVs also add a new “game optimizer” area to the settings menu, which puts all the crucial options for next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X / S gaming front and center for quick access. Both Nvidia G-Sync and FreeSync and AMD FreeSync Premium are supported by these panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wu2P5G"&gt;The G1 might get brighter, but the C1 certainly comes bigger: this year, LG has an 83-inch size for $5,999. Just imagine that ginormous OLED on your wall. Both the G1 and C1 include LG’s latest processor, which includes AI scene detection to optimize the picture for whatever you’re watching. LG also added a new ability to automatically level out audio volume when switching between content sources and streaming apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXsVaY"&gt;At the bottom of the lineup is the A1 series, which is positioned as LG’s entry-level OLED. In exchange for that low starting price (just $1,299 for a 48-inch model), you’re completely losing out on HDMI 2.1 features, and there’s an older processor inside that can sometimes allow for more banding and other visual quirks in complex scenes. It’ll still give you a beautiful picture — the A1 supports Dolby Vision, of course — but I’d recommend deal hunting for a 2020 BX or CX before settling for the A1. Still, once sales kick in for the 2021 lineup, that base model might hit the $999 mark, which is huge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHMeCa"&gt;Keep in mind that whichever new LG you choose, it’ll come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;a much different webOS than we’ve seen previously&lt;/a&gt;. The company has done away with the old blades interface that popped up from the bottom of the screen. Now, the software looks more reminiscent of what you’d find on a streaming box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JcZkZ"&gt;Here’s the full pricing for LG’s 2021 OLED lineup:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket League is coming to Android and iOS with a spinoff called Sideswipe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6k5JlbGVZezS3cDqtbZK_9eYYY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018836/sideswipe_header.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Psyonix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aHSFKm"&gt;If you have been looking to play &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;on the go but don’t own a Nintendo Switch, Psyonix’s massively popular vehicular soccer game is &lt;a href="http://rocketleague.com/news/announcing-rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile/"&gt;finally coming to mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;. The developer announced a new free-to-play version called &lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; that will arrive on iOS and Android later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpx0rR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; looks to be largely the same as the main version of &lt;em&gt;Rocket League,&lt;/em&gt; but it will bring a new perspective that accommodates mobile devices. According to the &lt;a href="http://rocketleague.com/news/announcing-rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, players will compete in two-minute 1v1 or 2v2 matches. Another big change to &lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; is a switch to touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MeAFrJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Rocket League’ coming to mobile devices is no surprise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mJrJy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; will be free to play, just like the main version, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438194/rocket-league-free-to-play-release-date-psyonix-epic-games"&gt;switched to this model last year&lt;/a&gt;. Before the game releases, Psyonix announced that a limited alpha test will be available on Android via Google Play to players in Australia and New Zealand today. More betas will be available in the coming months, according to Psyonix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwWzgq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;coming to mobile devices is no surprise, as it joins other popular PC and console games that have been ported to iOS and Android in recent years to largely great success. Most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18660985/pubg-mobile-monthly-revenue-players-highest-grossing-mobile-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s mobile versions have grown substantially by releasing mobile versions, with &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PUBGMOBILE/status/1373786682357657605"&gt;hitting 1 billion downloads worldwide&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. Next week will see &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; expand to mobile as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321348/league-of-legends-wild-rift-open-beta-mobile-ios-android"&gt;with the open beta of a spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Ocr4Y"&gt;Slack’s newest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature"&gt;direct message feature&lt;/a&gt;, part of a broader cross-organizational tool called Slack Connect, lets anyone with a professional Slack account DM another user so long as they have their email address. These messages, which are attached to invites, can be potentially abusive or harmful, points out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891"&gt;Menotti Minutillo&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter product employee who works on the company’s developer platform trust team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpNUza"&gt;There’s no way to block these invites, either. You could also trick someone into accepting your invite and then send them harassment or abusive messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CN2g8v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;well that was easy as shit to abuse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- send invite with nasty language&lt;br&gt;- slack emails you w/ the full content of the invite&lt;br&gt;- can't block the emails because they come from a generic slack address that informs you of invites&lt;br&gt;- abuser can keep inviting w/ abusive language &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a"&gt;https://t.co/Mw9W5L251a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dWEAD7ccRO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dWEAD7ccRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Menotti Minutillo (@44) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/44/status/1374737695444901891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKWrIX"&gt;The option appears available only to those with enterprise Slack accounts. The free version of Slack does not currently support the Connect platform, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302050/slack-connect-work-emails-shared-channels-future"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt;. Slack previewed the option to DM anyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505548/slack-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature"&gt;last October&lt;/a&gt;, and today it started rolling out the feature to all paid accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GtH70"&gt;But as Minutillo makes clear, there does not appear to be any safeguards against bad behavior built into the feature. You can’t opt out of the Connect DM feature unless your entire organization disables it, and you can’t block an email address from repeat messages or invites. Even if a workplace disables the ability to accept these invites, Minutillo says the optional invite text still shows up in the email in the tests he performed. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that the whole feature is opt-in from an IT admin level, but that doesn’t suggest you can turn it off for your individual account if your organization keeps it active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FMKel"&gt;One possibility is to filter your email to block specific subject lines, Minutillo says. But if the person trying to contact you switches email accounts, that won’t work either. Connect DMs require a verified email address that can, in theory, be traced back to an employer in some circumstances. Connect is available to anyone with a Standard tier account, which costs $8 per person per month. However, Slack also &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/202878523-Try-a-paid-plan-for-free"&gt;offers a free trial for its Standard and Plus tiers&lt;/a&gt; that might make signing up for such an account easier and cost-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esI3IC"&gt;Slack did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOFPMS"&gt;I tested this with my personal email account, and it’s easy to do: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivk51mE1kI4Lf5kHw37hbmTL-qI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394302/Slack_Connect_DM_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gybRw7"&gt;Slack, because it operates a free version that can be styled into semi-public chat rooms, has always had to deal with abuse. As pointed out by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixelyunicorn/status/1374741334339244034"&gt;some users responding in Minutillo’s thread&lt;/a&gt;, public Slack channels can still be abused by way of account invites, spam, and other techniques to send unwanted or hateful messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYXWyp"&gt;For instance, even if a public-facing Slack channel disables the ability for new users to post, they can still style usernames as short, abusive messages that show up in public channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DGVIj2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;even when i deleted my slack account, that didn’t stop people from spamming hundreds of slack invites with nasty things in it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/WQo5mSUIfR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WQo5mSUIfR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— melody ✨ (@pixelyunicorn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixelyunicorn/status/1374731281301397511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="29V7qz"&gt;Slack also doesn’t have the tools to monitor this harassment if it happens in private channels. The company outlined its data retention and privacy practices in an &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/slack-messaging-connect"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; that specify that each person’s parent organization will have the ability to store and read messages, as well as delete them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9fSJZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reports that Slack is verifying organizations that receive Connect access to ensure you know you’re talking to a legitimate member of another company, but that doesn’t stop someone from trying to masquerade as a legitimate corporate employee to try to initiate private DM conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcZNtq"&gt;Slack’s new form of DM is a pretty basic yet powerful two-way communication channel now open to the millions upon millions of its enterprise users, with no obvious opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber partners with ScriptDrop for prescription delivery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIEyChJ24ahDheNbDvzklR0QFhU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018310/jbareham_190510_3413_0067.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k5dTzv"&gt;Pharmacies using prescription delivery service ScriptDrop will deliver medications to customers through Uber, the company announced today. Uber will be the default delivery service for ScriptDrop pharmacies in 37 states and will eventually expand to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEQixf"&gt;The service lets pharmacies offer prescription deliveries for patients. The tool can integrate with whatever organizational software the pharmacies normally use to keep track of prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksLo6G"&gt;“Being able to combine ScriptDrop’s integrated interface with Uber’s technology means that pharmacies of all sizes will be better equipped to improve prescription adherence and serve the most vulnerable of their communities,” Amanda Epp, ScriptDrop CEO, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq9GKO"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mail-order-drug-delivery-rises-during-coronavirus-lockdowns-11589281203"&gt;fueled a rise&lt;/a&gt; in mail-order and courier-based drug deliveries, as people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;avoided&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in-person trips to the pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3OP4P"&gt;This is Uber’s second foray into prescription delivery. It partnered with NimbleRx to deliver drugs in Seattle and Dallas &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fuber-health-expands-to-include-prescription-delivery%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22346330%2Fuber-perscription-delivery-scriptdrop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It then &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128006020/en/Uber-Eats-Announces-Prescription-Delivery-in-NYC-with-Nimble"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; that service to Austin, Houston, and New York City. The company has other health care functions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/1/17061862/uber-health-non-emergency-medical-transportation-hipaa"&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; that lets doctors or other providers book rides for patients to and from appointments. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google rubs it in with new Photos collection of all the pints you once enjoyed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Barnimer Brauhaus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XKxGX3H0O7VdG1wYlewaTXV6EGM=/0x53:4452x3021/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018245/1231526002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="28aNU5"&gt;You know what I haven’t seen in more than a year? The inside of a pub. Or a bar. Or, indeed, any kind of inn, hostelry, saloon, roadhouse, taproom, tavern, or beer hall where money can be exchanged for the sweet relief of drink. Google, though, hasn’t forgotten and has apparently decided to taunt me with a new tag in its Photo app dedicated to the stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi5PX0"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/24/google-photos-pours-the-beers-in-new-cheers-memories-collection/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if you open up the Google Photos app right now, it should have a new Memories collection at the top of the screen. These are thematic groupings of photos selected by machine learning, and while previous collections have focused on children or food, this one — appropriately titled “Cheers!” — is dedicated to booze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Onws6V"&gt;Click the image, and you’ll be shown a bittersweet slideshow: pictures of drinks being drunk with friends and loved ones. To paraphrase &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;’s famous &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/suRDUFpsHus"&gt;Carousel scene&lt;/a&gt;, here is the essence of nostalgia, taking us to a place where we ache to go again. The pub. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAkkZlfXC1T6LkM4uKfeeofvG7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394179/google_cheers_category.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photos by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A sampling from the Cheers! collection in Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRGKAB"&gt;A tiny caveat: when &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers looked for the “Cheers!” collection in their own app, not everyone found it. And those who did noted that the software didn’t always pick up on all of the relevant pictures of pitchers. (Maybe it’s a fussy drinker? Can’t relate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TFxWf"&gt;At any rate, it’s another neat demonstration of the power of Google’s machine learning photo tools as well as a cruel reminder of what most of us are currently missing. And please, if you’re in a country where pubs and bars are currently open, where you can simply walk out the door and grab yourself a pint in the sunshine, I &lt;em&gt;beg&lt;/em&gt; of you: shut up and don’t talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to write special characters on Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sS-LrvGE5QPG1pL_bM9oGK4x_gg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018184/akrales_191112_3778_0249.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBtPSS"&gt;Here’s the situation: you’re typing a report for work, and you suddenly have to write the phrase “Jones née Berkowitz.” Or you are adding a phrase in Spanish and need to use the word “años.” How do you add the special characters to the letters? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JFT5W"&gt;Special characters (also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"&gt;diacritical marks&lt;/a&gt;) may be more common in certain languages, but there are plenty of circumstances in which English speakers may need to use them. But because they are so rare in English, native English speakers may not have learned how to add those marks to documents, emails, or other writings on their Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRZX20"&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvDkQ8"&gt;For access to more common diacritical marks, you just need to hold down the key for the letter you want to use until a small numbered menu appears on-screen. The menu that pops up will show all of the diacritical marks available for that letter; just type the correct number, and the letter with the mark will appear on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you hold down the “e” key, all the available diacritical marks will appear with numbers." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lQylY49xNLKgOD77bi_a9SHOtIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392479/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_4.23.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you hold down the “e” key, all of the available diacritical marks will appear with numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y5DuVs"&gt;Use the Keyboard Viewer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eRdvwX"&gt;There are a number of other special characters that you may want to use, which you can access by pressing down the Option key on your Mac’s keyboard and then pressing the appropriate key. Not sure which key is the appropriate one? There is a Keyboard Viewer that will let you see all of the variations that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAK98V"&gt;It’s simple to find the Keyboard Viewer — if you’ve got the icon for the Input Menu in your menu bar. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The icon for the Input Menu appears in the upper right menu bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dYD2r3F68kc5r3DlgYMYxZG2Xks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394003/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_10.14.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The icon for the Input Menu appears in the upper right menu bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xQcvxq"&gt;Don’t see it? Here’s how to get it into your menu bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl7NKj"&gt;Go to Apple menu &amp;gt; System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard. Click on the Input Sources tab and look for the checkbox labeled “Show Input menu in menu bar.” If it’s not checked, then check it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To get the Input Menu icon, you need to enable it in your Keyboard preferences." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WiCbL_Acqn_3IwZTqEaWlHnPrTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394067/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_4.35.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To get the Input Menu icon, you need to enable it in your Keyboard preferences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zxijHT"&gt;Click on the Input Menu icon (which will now be on the right side of your menu bar). Select “Show Keyboard Viewer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0bhP9"&gt;A visual of your keyboard will appear on your screen. If you press on the Option key on your keyboard, the Keyboard Viewer will show you what special characters are available if you press those keys in combination with the Option key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Keyboard viewer will show you available special characters...." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sDlQg-Zuy5QhxzJYxkY86Nan_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394069/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_10.28.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Keyboard viewer will show special characters....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...if you press the Options key." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ke4u73Kh3RR7SaCxIuql3Q6zJeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394073/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_10.28.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...if you press the Option key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhqUrG"&gt;Note: some of the keys will be outlined in orange. These are the keys we mentioned earlier, the ones that have several special characters and can be held down to see the various characters that can be used with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7VgaE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Doc1o0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIe848"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdHJvu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LShx8f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg proposes limited 230 reforms ahead of congressional hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg Hearing In Congress" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcGItWvH8CEQZND-Ms84ODpHXkM=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018054/1177753310.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Aurora Samperio / NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SlNHzI"&gt;Opening statements from &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20210325/111407/HHRG-117-IF16-Wstate-ZuckerbergM-20210325-U1.pdf"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20210325/111407/HHRG-117-IF16-Wstate-PichaiS-20210325-SD001.pdf"&gt;Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20210325/111407/HHRG-117-IF16-Bio-DorseyJ-20210325.pdf"&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; have been published ahead of &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting"&gt;Thursday’s misinformation hearing in the House&lt;/a&gt; — and they show all three CEOs taking on an unusually sensitive issue for tech platforms. All three statements are worth reading, with Dorsey focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;internal tools like Birdwatch&lt;/a&gt; and Pichai warning of the dangers of a full repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLAs3X"&gt;But the most detailed proposal came from Zuckerberg, who talked at length about his preferred changes to Section 230. Instead of repealing the law entirely — as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070403/joe-biden-president-election-section-230-communications-decency-act-revoke"&gt;President Biden called for&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign — Zuckerberg’s proposal would make Section 230 conditional on companies maintaining a system to remove illegal content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6aldx"&gt;As Zuckerberg describes it in the letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mKS594"&gt;We believe Congress should consider making platforms’ intermediary liability protection for certain types of unlawful content conditional on companies’ ability to meet best practices to combat the spread of this content. Instead of being granted immunity, platforms should be required to demonstrate that they have systems in place for identifying unlawful content and removing it. Platforms should not be held liable if a particular piece of content evades its detection — that would be impractical for platforms with billions of posts per day — but they should be required to have adequate systems in place to address unlawful content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="8xOlOb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VUfyyh"&gt;The standards for retaining 230 protections could be set by a third party, Zuckerberg goes on to say, and would exclude demands around encryption and privacy “that deserve a hearing in their own right.” That distinguishes Zuckerberg’s proposal from previously introduced 230 bills like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21162983/congress-senate-earn-it-act-lindsey-graham-richard-blumenthal-section-230-encryption-bill-proposed"&gt;the EARN IT Act&lt;/a&gt;, which conditions protections on a long-sought encryption backdoor. Zuckerberg’s proposal is closer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21340737/section-230-pact-act-thune-schatz-big-tech-reform-hearing"&gt;the PACT Act&lt;/a&gt;, which conditions the protections on transparency disclosures and other measures but focuses less on the removal of illegal content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbn9WF"&gt;Broadly, it’s unusual for companies to propose rules for how they would like to be regulated, but it’s less unusual for Zuckerberg, who has previously written at length about favorable &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html"&gt;data portability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/19/21142478/facebook-regulation-content-moderation-singapore-pakistan"&gt;content moderation&lt;/a&gt; rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1jnXO"&gt;This is the most detailed proposal for Section 230 that Zuckerberg has yet put forward, and it’s one that would require few material changes for Facebook itself. Facebook already maintains significant systems for identifying and removing illegal or otherwise objectionable content. Still, the proposal might address some of the most urgent objections to Section 230, which often focus on smaller sites entirely dedicated to malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgU3mJ"&gt;The issue is particularly urgent for groups like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which struggle with websites that don’t scan or moderate for child abuse imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2am0Z2"&gt;“There are a lot of companies, especially some of the very large companies, that engage in really tremendous voluntary measures,” NCMEC’s Yiota Souras &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302850/section-230-reform-internet-speech-moderation-platforms"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. “But there are a lot of companies that don’t, and there is no legal requirement for them to use any kind of detection or screening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olfJYJ"&gt;The hearing is scheduled to begin at 12PM ET on Thursday, March 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The electric bucket trucks are coming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrGRFEAOastUXsGEWqh2VbIIrE0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017826/Lion8_BucketTruck_Rendering_Background_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTiJWM"&gt;We’ve seen electric pickup trucks, electric school buses, and even a few electric 18-wheelers. But where are the electric aerial work platform trucks, known colloquially as bucket trucks? Con Edison may have an answer. The energy utility for New York City, and one of the largest energy companies in the US, is teaming up with a Canadian manufacturer to add battery-powered bucket trucks to its fleet by 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnyCfP"&gt;ConEd’s fleet isn’t exactly enormous — the utility owns around 300 bucket trucks — but the company hopes to send a signal to manufacturers that the time has come to electrify these types of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tHLYSW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This represents an important step in Con Edison’s journey toward fleet electrification”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nj6AKs"&gt;“Medium- and heavy-duty trucks are more challenging to electrify than cars, but the purchase of our first all-electric bucket truck shows the market is real today and it will only accelerate from here,” ConEd CEO Tim Cawley said in a statement. “While initially small in scope, this represents an important step in Con Edison’s journey toward fleet electrification.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8JBI1"&gt;ConEd is working with two Canadian manufacturers, Lion Electric and Posi-Plus, on the design and production of its electric truck. It will have a Lion8 all-electric chassis, which underpins a few of Lion’s electric vehicles, as well as a crane and cherry picker to help ConEd workers reach power lines and other elevated infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYG1yW"&gt;The vehicle is scheduled for delivery in early 2022, which will be followed by its use in a pilot program. If successful, ConEd says the bucket truck will be integrated as part of its fleet of trucks that maintains the overhead electric system in both New York City and Westchester County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvdEA1"&gt;The class 8 truck will get an estimated 130 miles on a single charge. The battery will take eight hours to recharge when plugged into two AC Level 2 chargers, ConEd said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfR9nn"&gt;ConEd has been working to eliminate the emissions from its fleet before this announcement. As of last year, every new light-duty vehicle that the company buys is a plug-in hybrid or electric. The company said it is exploring a range of technologies to reduce its fossil fuel use in medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, and it may add more all-electric bucket trucks to its fleet in the future. Though it wouldn’t say when it plans to completely phase out fossil fuel-burning vehicles from its fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
