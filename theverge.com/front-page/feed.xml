        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1, and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $219 or in white for $250. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13e6oH"&gt;For big discounts on the best sound quality from Apple’s AirPods line, the AirPods Max can be bought from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon in space gray or sky blue colorways for just $440&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a hefty $109 off on two sleek colors of Apple’s top-end headphones. It may not be the all-time low price for the AirPods Max, but it’s the closest you can get right now if you’re shopping early. Be sure to add either of the two colors to your cart and see the extra savings of $39 reflected at checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SnzpqH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXKZ1c"&gt;The hottest new racing game for Xbox consoles, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5, &lt;/em&gt;is currently on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forza-Horizon-Standard-Xbox-One-X/dp/B097MGZ7MY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon for $51&lt;/a&gt;. This is the latest installment in the Forza franchise and the newest sequel to the open-world racing spinoff. The current deal is for the physical copy on Xbox consoles. It’s also available digitally through Xbox Game Pass on both Xbox and PC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pMfRVE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Amazon is currently offering some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/4998f143?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=26&amp;amp;imprToken=c2be8a99-20b2-dfab-0c4&amp;amp;showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_8_4998f143_dt_sl5_f1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22541018%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;excellent savings on a variety of Shure microphones&lt;/a&gt;. These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u3IApI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $210 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $215 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="FfgzdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ejfdaH"&gt;Best Buy Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning the retailer will refund the price difference of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfZfEpiMWAR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nl3yNN"&gt;Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts on LG’s C1 OLED&lt;/a&gt; as Amazon, while adding other perks in addition to the six-month subscription to HBO Max. These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzBPD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of other products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is currently selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $280. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T59Y6S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="CO0Wc6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_7721606980660150198sIzbeu"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy at an all-time low. Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $220. Like the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzQ0Njg2L2FwcGxlLWFpcnBvZHMtdGhpcmQtZ2VuLXJldmlldw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Be70b5668" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 AirPods Pro come with a new charging case that &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTgvMjI3MzMxODMvYXBwbGUtbWFnc2FmZS1jaGFyZ2luZy1jYXNlLWFpcnBvZHMtcHJvLXFp/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bd83707a1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;works with Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging system&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $130 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUs7A8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $100 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $1,100 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL6nXD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AhcBZ8"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wijGQu"&gt;B&amp;amp;H deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip, and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3zmNuJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AuzgvG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848365"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZr7KF"&gt;Sony’s ZV-1 point-and-shoot camera is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1566753-REG%2Fsony_sony_zv_1_digital_camera.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $746&lt;/a&gt; with a vlogger accessory kit at B&amp;amp;H, a savings of $150. The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which affords you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jv2SvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptops to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNqjUh"&gt;First off, the Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great, and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TALLIn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xgjs1u"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th and has been running similar deals every week since. The retail store also officially launched its weekly &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187778/2092?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridaySales111221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Holiday Best” deals&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, which run every Sunday online and in-store. Target will also be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kGsRxP"&gt;Probably the best deal Target has going for it right now is its &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CcA5Vj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is also currently selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $200. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1141873/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now, $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold. Target’s current discount was supposed to expire on November 6th, however, it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6bMV4g"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frazer-viper-8-khz-ambidextrous-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-8000-hz-polling-rate%2F-%2FA-82718043&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Target for $50&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ey6aVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhp-15-6-34-laptop-with-windows-home-in-s-mode-intel-core-i3-11th-gen-processor-8gb-ram-memory-256gb-ssd-storage-silver-15-dy2035tg%2F-%2FA-82457999&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at Target for $430 instead of $540. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. Like the Beats Solo 3 deal, the discount was supposed to expire on November 7th, meaning its duration is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue superstore recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire soon. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;Below, we’ve collected a handful of deals that piqued our interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $79&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s text-to-speech TikTok voices censored words like “gay” and “lesbian”</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9GUSXSKf29drpIixxZKi3206z4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146807/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="caAqlz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kbwild_/video/7030602779139919109"&gt;TikTokers have demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;Disney’s text-to-speech TikTok voice&lt;/a&gt;, meant to sound like Rocket the Raccoon, would refuse to read words like “gay,” “lesbian,” or “queer” out loud. This decision seems to have been reverted — you can now get the voice to read out those words, but it’s unclear why it was happening. The change, however, is very recent — &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that the voice wouldn’t say the words, but it started to do so in a subsequent test minutes later on Monday afternoon. TikTok hasn’t commented on why this happened, but videos posted to highlight the issue still have the words blanked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIsBxe"&gt;Rocket’s voice was introduced to TikTok’s text-to-speech feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;as part of a Disney Plus Day promotion&lt;/a&gt; last week. Other voices, like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bigweenie1937/video/7029920535513451782"&gt;C-3PO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@caprhicorn/video/7030083950949289222"&gt;Stitch&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Lilo and Stitch&lt;/em&gt;, are also supposed to be part of the promotion, but unlike Rocket’s voice they have to be unlocked by using secret phrases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chHNzk"&gt;Prior to the change, Rocket’s voice would skip over the words mentioned above (but seemed to have no issue with words like “transgender” or “bisexual”), though you could easily get the character to say it with phonetically similar misspellings like “qweer.” Trying to make it read text that only contained one of the banned words would result in an error saying that text-to-speech wasn’t supported for the language. TikTok’s own built-in, non-Disney voices would read the word “gay” just fine, either by itself or in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77eXy4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kbwild_/video/7030602779139919109"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok making the rounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; shows what would happen before the change — Rocket wouldn’t say words like “gay” or “queer,” but would say “homophobic.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Flp2LWolhM3APHvtgwYvZOBUuTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017306/IMG_1134.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trying to select Rocket to read the word “gay” would result in an error message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LyXeIo"&gt;Disney has never had a great track record when it comes to LGBTQ representation — many of its iconic villains &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsWpUSEKSbk"&gt;have historically been queer-coded&lt;/a&gt; (something you couldn’t say using Rocket’s voice), and its more recent efforts at representation have been &lt;a href="https://collider.com/why-disney-queer-representation-is-failing/"&gt;limited to single scenes or lines&lt;/a&gt; that are easy to edit out. TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519433/tiktok-intersex-ban-mistake-moderation-transparency"&gt;also has a history&lt;/a&gt; of repeatedly breaking the intersex tag that activists used for activism and education, which the company claimed was a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ORBsz"&gt;Still, outright censoring words about queer identities seems like a stronger step than either company would usually take in 2021. It’s unclear what led them to do so in the first place, and why the decision was reversed. Neither Disney nor TikTok immediately responded to repeated requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CvBXKI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither company has explained why this decision was made or reversed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqnn0l"&gt;It’s always possible that this was implemented for well-meaning, if not misguided purposes — bullies have long used both gay and lesbian in an attempt to insult people who don’t identify as such. However, it’s hard to imagine a more effective bullying tactic than literally preventing queer people from talking about their identities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSCntX"&gt;While it’s understandable that Disney wouldn’t want its characters’ voices reading things that aren’t family-friendly like serious swears or slurs (though it’s worth noting that Rocket tosses out phrases like “jackass” and “douchebag” in &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;), we’re well past the point where labeling LGBTQ+ people’s identities as antithetical to family values is acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33BHmk"&gt;It should go without saying that many families include queer people, including ones that are children in Disney’s target demographic, who may want to use TikTok’s text-to-speech feature to talk about their lives and experiences. While it’s good that this decision appears to have been reversed (though it’s unclear why or by whom), it’s one that shouldn’t have been made in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon fined $500,000 for failing to notify California workers about COVID-19 cases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8SfArYOQM-pLqj-qDlm452oyqM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146805/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xRSHea"&gt;Amazon has been ordered to pay a fine of $500,000 for hiding the number of COVID-19 cases at its California workplaces from employees. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-15/amazon-covid-outbreak-workplace-safety-right-to-know-penalty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company agreed to pay the fine and improve the way it tracks cases and notifies workers and local health agencies. Amazon must also inform its warehouse workers in California of the “exact number of new COVID-19 cases in their workplaces” when cases arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K7RPpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the first fine related to California’s COVID “right to know” legislation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lp6vUg"&gt;California attorney general Rob Bonta said in a &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/nationwide-first-attorney-general-bonta-secures-judgment-requiring-amazon-comply"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that the penalty comes after a complaint filed against Amazon alleged that the company didn’t properly notify warehouse workers and local health agencies about new COVID-19 cases “often leaving them in the dark and unable to effectively track the spread of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jp3o8"&gt;This is the first fine related to &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB685"&gt;California’s COVID “right to know” (AB 685) legislation&lt;/a&gt;, which was passed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the&lt;em&gt; LA Times&lt;/em&gt; reported. Under the law, employers are required to alert workers who were potentially exposed to COVID-19 within one day, and must also report COVID-19 case numbers to local health agencies within 48 hours if they “meet the definition of a COVID-19 outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir6agD"&gt;“As our nation continues to battle the pandemic, it is absolutely critical that businesses do their part to protect workers now — and especially during this holiday season,” Bonta said in the press release. “Californians have a right to know about potential exposures to the coronavirus to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fpUsl"&gt;Amazon was criticized for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/1/21201162/amazon-delivery-delays-coronavirus-worker-strikes"&gt;treatment of workers&lt;/a&gt; throughout the pandemic. Last March, Michigan warehouse workers were angered when &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194739/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-outraged-informed"&gt;Amazon failed to notify them&lt;/a&gt; that their coworker had COVID-19, meanwhile, workers in New York &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;staged walkouts&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to Amazon’s handling of the pandemic. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259474/amazon-warehouse-worker-death-indiana"&gt;refused to say&lt;/a&gt; how many of its warehouse workers were sick across the country, only to eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497941/amazon-disclose-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;disclose a number&lt;/a&gt; in October of 2020. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22734765/fda-covid-vaccine-5-11-year-old-approve"&gt;vaccines have become available&lt;/a&gt; to almost everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757927/amazon-lifts-mask-mandates-vaccinated-warehouse-employees"&gt;Amazon lifted mask mandates&lt;/a&gt; for vaccinated employees and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;plans to let corporate workers return to the office in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes will take your $1.2 million but not your phone calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naaGpAglZht_v6ahFzMSgFgrYiU=/0x0:2496x1664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146697/1341968234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/The Mercury News via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We met an investor who won’t take a hint — or even a command&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5uYJOf"&gt;Lately I have been reflecting on Alan Eisenman, Theranos investor and human cowboy boot. He’s wealthy, the kind of character Matthew McConaughey will play in about 15 years; on the stand, his hair was almost as white as his shirt, which was unbuttoned at the top. (No tie, of course.) He seemed like someone that would be fun to drink a whiskey with, as long as he got to do all the talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7A2gAH"&gt;In court, his sense of grievance was palpable: this man feels he has been &lt;em&gt;done wrong.&lt;/em&gt; “I think there was business fraud,” Eisenman said. “I think I was lied to and taken advantage of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E7PAvb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think I was lied to and taken advantage of.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnoO54"&gt;It is easy to laugh at these investors, who are committing a tremendous social sin: claiming a role (investor) they appear to be unqualified for (because of an inability to do &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/04/technology/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-investors-diligence.html"&gt;proper due diligence&lt;/a&gt;). It is a specific &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of investor I keep noticing popping up again and again: the high net worth individual or family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIDUra"&gt;Now, during the period during which Elizabeth Holmes is alleged by the government to have committed wire fraud, startups were one of the fastest-growth sectors of the economy. At the same time, there was an &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/12/15/family-offices-become-financial-titans"&gt;explosion of family offices&lt;/a&gt;, managing money for what one witness  (and Theranos investor, to the tune of $6 million) called “&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/attorney-of-henry-kissinger-put-6-million-in-theranos-due-to-holmes.html"&gt;high-quality families.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6h4Ma"&gt;Most of these family offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;had no business whatsoever&lt;/a&gt; investing in healthcare startups, and Eisenman and his family are no exception. They didn’t know what data to ask for and couldn’t interpret the data they got. Holmes’ defense strategy, then, is to paint these investors as naifs who failed to do their due diligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uphrU4"&gt;Eisenman invested about $1.2 million in Theranos in 2006, after a five-minute phone call with Holmes. For a while, he got quarterly updates on Theranos, though those meetings ceased in 2010, and Holmes seemed to be sick of Eisenman pestering her for information. In one email, she even told him she’d buy him out, letting him make 5x on his investment. Eisenman did not take her up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A5pkLx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Incredibly, after all this, Eisenman invested in Theranos &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RQXbg"&gt;In fact, Eisenman had multiple opportunities to sell his Theranos shares, including ones that would have gotten him north of $20 million on a $1.2 million investment. Each time he declined, saying he didn’t have enough information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZxC3X"&gt;Incredibly, after all this, Eisenman invested in Theranos &lt;em&gt;again — &lt;/em&gt;for $100,000 in 2013, which forms the basis for one of the government’s counts of wire fraud. By this time, former Theranos comptroller Danise Yam testified Theranos had a dispute with its auditor, and there had been no audited financial statements since 2009. This is what the children call a “red flag.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dc9M0S"&gt;But Eisenman didn’t come to Theranos cold. He had a social connection — he was friends with the Holmes’ family’s financial advisor, who had also invested. Plus, his wife’s father, who had also invested, was friendly with Frist, who was on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rndYag"&gt;Social heuristics seem to have played a heavy part in the family office investments; Henry Kissinger’s attorney alone, Daniel Mosley, introduced Holmes to a number of investors: the Walton family, the DeVos family, and the Cox family, among others. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/1qxHNRhKgViGm1EBAqel"&gt;Mosley’s network invested $384 million&lt;/a&gt;, over half of the $730 million funding round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvN9SQ"&gt;Eisenman’s direct testimony went mostly smoothly, but the cross-examination was unusually obstreperous. Several times, Judge Edward Davila explained to Eisenman that the lawyers got to ask the questions, and Eisenman’s job was to answer them. Eisenman was so uncooperative that he often demanded evidence to refresh his memory, even, notably, when the evidence being discussed was right in front of him, pulled up on the court’s monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Ck3fr8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m a smart guy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LGTqF5"&gt;One particularly memorable exchange involved Kevin Downey, attorney for Elizabeth Holmes, who was asking Eisenman about a 2015 email. In the email, Sunny Balwani made reference to a conversation he and Eisenman had in 2013 about Eisenman selling his shares. Eisenman was of the opinion that the 2015 email misrepresented his 2013 conversation with Balwani. Downey asked if Eisenman had told Balwani that, at least three and perhaps as many as five times. Eisenman somehow managed not to answer this question, seeming to be confused about what had occurred in 2013 and what had happened in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5e9DIW"&gt;On direct examination, we’d been shown several emails of Holmes and Balwani telling Eisenman to, essentially, stop pestering them. Before we left court last week, Eisenman talked with the prosecutors to tell them about his travel plans. They discouraged him from talking to them again. Less than 15 hours later, he emailed a member of the prosecution team to ask how his testimony had gone. The agent in question called him to tell him not to talk to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqSa7M"&gt;The next day, Eisenman emailed the government again, to tell them his travel plans, and received another scolding phone call. Eisenman said that he didn’t think the email was a big deal — he was just discussing his travel plan. The fact that he had been told at least three times not to talk to the government didn’t seem to matter to him. Downey asked whether it was up to him whether the communication violated the court’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCMFJs"&gt;“I’m a smart guy,” Eisenman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bXAfQW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is what we call boilerplate, as you know as an attorney.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nU5vSz"&gt;In 2010, Holmes emailed Eisenman the following: “Alan. Your continued daily calls and emails after we’ve already told you multiple times that we do not have additional information we can disclose beyond what we’ve already shared with David [a fellow investor] are upsetting to us.” Eisenman moved on to contacting board members, including Bill Frist, the former senator, who was friendly with Eisenman’s father-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHUbkh"&gt;The juxtaposition of Eisenman’s behavior this weekend — refusing to listen, continuing to send unwanted emails — with the emails we saw in court was striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQdJCd"&gt;Weird as his court performance was — almost a perfect demonstration of how the rich are accustomed to the world bending to their whims — and as lacking as his due diligence was, that doesn’t make him any less of a victim, if he was lied to. It may be easier to make victims of family offices, partly because they invest based on the family’s social life. And they may explain why Eisenman, when confronted with the investment contract he signed, said, “This is what we call boilerplate, as you know as an attorney.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ltdlxk"&gt;Eisenman’s next remark was that what was more important than the contract, was the conversations he had with the principals. The paperwork isn’t the important part, for him. He likes the social activity of being an investor. He’s not just mad about the money, although he is probably also mad about the money. He’s mad that he’s been embarrassed — and his reputation has taken a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="m7QTWV"&gt;Which does explain why he’s so aggrieved: here he is, out in front of God and everyone, showing himself to be &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00332747.1952.11022896"&gt;a mark&lt;/a&gt;. And a pesky one, at that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future launches investigation into financial fraud allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4VORMBIdZ3fP-jLRFnclB6t3DA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146439/Home_charging_convert_default.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FmO7Kl"&gt;Faraday Future is launching an investigation into recent allegations of financial fraud at the startup, including claims from &lt;a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2021_10_07_ffie.pdf"&gt;a recent short-seller report&lt;/a&gt; by J Capital. The EV startup’s board of directors has formed a “special committee of independent directors,” which has hired a law firm to perform the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYuZOy"&gt;J Capital had accused Faraday Future of lying about the number of reservations it had collected for its ultra-expensive electric SUV, the FF91. It also accused Faraday Future’s founder Jia Yueting of unfairly benefitting from the startup’s recent public listing, which it accomplished after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587530/faraday-future-nasdaq-ffie-spac-ipo-investors-funding"&gt;merging with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9mGDA"&gt;“Faraday Future seeks to do business in the most ethical and transparent way,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021059453/ea150561ex99-1_faraday.htm"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “As a new public company, the Board, as part of its review, is seeking to ensure that the Company is adhering to the highest standards of conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmjRNv"&gt;The startup revealed the investigation Monday &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021059455/ea150623-nt10q_faradayfuture.htm"&gt;in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Faraday Future alerted the agency that it was not able to file its full financial results for the third quarter of 2021 on time due to the investigation. The startup did share that it lost $280 million in the third quarter, though, and reaffirmed its goal to deliver the first FF91s in July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2O0Lr"&gt;“The investigation is ongoing, and the Special Committee continues to work diligently with outside counsel and advisors to complete the investigation as soon as possible,” Faraday Future wrote in the filing. “The Company cannot predict the duration of the investigation, eventual scope, its outcome, or its impact on the Company’s financial results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRaulg"&gt;The startup did not name the independent directors on the committee, or the outside law firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kSNVW"&gt;Faraday Future is the latest EV startup to face allegations of financial fraud by a research firm with a short position — meaning the firm stands to make money if the startup’s stock price falls. Hindenburg Research released reports on Nikola and Lordstown Motors, and both of those startups &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;wound up facing government investigations&lt;/a&gt;. (Nikola’s founder and former CEO was indicted as a result.) EV startup Workhorse is also under investigation after a short-seller report was published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765287/doj-investigation-ev-workhorse-accounting-fraud-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;accusing it of fraud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US finally adopts a national recycling strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-SOCIAL-POVERTY-ENVIRONMENT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dgtdhvie6-mg4puJ2py1afe8PSc=/6x0:5789x3855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146435/1236240047.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ekwMsH"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-bold-national-strategy-transform-recycling-america"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new national recycling strategy today, the agency’s first ever such commitment, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2021/11/15/epa-national-recycling-strategy-plastics/"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eLmnN"&gt;It’s a roadmap for the US to achieve a goal of recycling at least half of its municipal waste by the end of the decade. That’s a steep rise considering the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#NationalPicture"&gt;US’ recycling rate&lt;/a&gt; has actually declined since 2015, and was only at about 32 percent of all municipal waste in 2018 (the most recent year for which there’s EPA data). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRQZH6"&gt;The recycling &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/recyclingstrategy/strategies-building-circular-economy-all"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; the EPA announced today are just the first piece in “a series” of forthcoming documents the agency plans to release to work towards a “circular economy,” or an economy where resources are recovered and reused to make new products rather than allowed to wind up in landfills. It’s a sort of tacit acknowledgement that recycling alone doesn’t make a huge dent in the world’s trash problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wo4Ygf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Inadequacies with America’s recycling system were laid bare &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNTN3W"&gt;Inadequacies with America’s recycling system were laid bare after &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat0131"&gt;China stopped accepting&lt;/a&gt; much of our so-called recyclable garbage in 2018, including post-consumer plastic. Some municipal recycling programs were forced to close or cut back on their programs, which ultimately sent more stuff to landfills and incinerators. Programs that stuck around are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219042/online-shopping-ecommerce-packaging-cardboard-boxes-recycling"&gt;recovering from that global shock, on top of having to adapt to new consumer habits&lt;/a&gt; accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oG3sm"&gt;A dearth of federal recycling policy has, until now, hampered efforts to solve the problem. There are several key tactics the EPA plans to employ to meet its new recycling goal. For starters, the US will have to do a better job of collecting recyclable materials. The uptick in online shopping has changed where packaging waste winds up. There’s less cardboard for instance, coming from shopping malls and grocery stores because of the popularity of home deliveries. That has posed problems for recycling companies because cardboard coming from peoples’ homes tends to be dirtier than retailers’ trash, experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Often times, cardboard or plastic that’s too contaminated with food or other items can’t be recycled. So the EPA intends to do more public outreach and education to ensure more of the stuff people throw out actually gets recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyShVM"&gt;The EPA also wants to develop new markets for recycled materials so that it’s worth it for companies to recycle. That means there could be new policies or financial incentives on the way to boost demand for recycled materials. The strategy document mentions, for example, a “Demand Challenge partnership program” that would recognize companies for using more recycled materials in their products&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Notably, the EPA says it might finally “explore” ratification of the Basel Convention, a 1989 international treaty aimed at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20992240/e-waste-recycling-electronic-basel-convention-crime-total-reclaim-fraud"&gt;reducing the flow of e-waste&lt;/a&gt; and other hazardous trash from wealthy to lower income nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0b2vE5"&gt;The new strategy also marks the first time, the EPA says, that the agency’s recycling plans will connect the dots between waste, environmental injustice, and the climate crisis. The modern environmental justice movement, which fights to stop pollution from disproportionately burdening low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, has its &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/lm/services/environmental-justice/environmental-justice-history"&gt;roots in protests against a landfill&lt;/a&gt; built in a predominantly Black community in North Carolina in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQJKIS"&gt;Recently, plastic pollution has been in the limelight as a growing body of research finds plastics building up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226655/microplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-ocean"&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;sea life&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689941/babies-infants-poop-microplastics"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, too. Plastics are also tied to another environmental crisis: climate change. They’re &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=34&amp;amp;t=6"&gt;made from fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;, and oil and gas companies are looking to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21419505/oil-gas-price-plastics-peak-climate-change"&gt;lean more heavily into their plastics business&lt;/a&gt; as renewable energy eats into their profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uiku7G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stopping heaps of plastic and other garbage from piling up requires systemic changes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NdkNRk"&gt;The plastics industry has a &lt;a href="https://publicintegrity.org/environment/pollution/pushing-plastic/inside-the-long-war-to-protect-plastic/"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of promoting recycling as the solution for its waste problem. But in reality, only about &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782"&gt;nine percent&lt;/a&gt; of all plastic waste has ever been recycled. Some environmental &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712435/recycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution"&gt;experts and activists are also concerned that developing the market for recycled plastic might actually drive up demand for new plastics&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the quality of materials typically degrades each time they’re re-hashed, which is why products made with recycled plastic are often reinforced with new plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkb7NZ"&gt;Stopping heaps of plastic and other garbage from piling up requires systemic changes in how we use materials, not just how we handle them at the end of their life. That’s why the EPA says it’s working towards a circular economy, which addresses the entire lifecycle of a good that’s produced. Ultimately, achieving a circular economy will entail using fewer raw materials, designing products that last longer and use fewer resources, and having policies and infrastructure in place to efficiently collect items for reuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KefUgw"&gt;Basically, there needs to be a concerted effort to stop producing junk in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptFjNZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDTmSp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai’s restomod Grandeur is the perfect EV for a supervillain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bEReLMrzp1n-2scZ-zBOfg-3OoY=/1x0:1119x745/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146323/newsroom_211112_grandeur_1120x745.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q134Df"&gt;As someone who only dabbles in car culture, I usually find concepts to be more weird than enticing — but this is absolutely not the case for &lt;a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-motor-pays-tribute-to-original-grandeur-flagship-sedan-with-heritage-series-ev-resto-mod-0000016755?type=RES&amp;amp;category=News&amp;amp;listPageUrl=newsroom"&gt;Hyundai's Heritage Series Grandeur EV&lt;/a&gt;, which goes with an incredible retro aesthetic, rather than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054257/mercedes-benz-avatar-avtr-concept-ces-2020"&gt;an alien future one&lt;/a&gt;. While Hyundai says that the car is made to celebrate the anniversary of its flagship sedan launched in the mid-‘80s, there’s only one thing that springs to mind when looking at it: that it would be the perfect vehicle for a supervillain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ys7D1Z"&gt;To be clear, I don’t mean a Marvel-style antagonist with supernatural powers. I mean a Gordan Gekko-esque SOB; someone rich enough to shape the future or bend the ear of bought-off politicians. The car’s blacked-out windows, solid hubcaps, and pixel-esque lights would look perfect in a Hollywood movie that warns audiences about the perils of greed, while simultaneously making its spoils look so damn enticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fSMcfJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10867076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUaJwoagWpXBvL_He-xjX9hFSO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017009/Photo_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The infotainment system, which you could use to queue up your playlist that just loops The Weeknd’s “Heartless”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and “Faith&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0fndLE"&gt;(Side note: a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EXdhUqwD4QE?t=42"&gt;video of the car posted on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; shows that the head and taillight “pixels” can even animate, a la KITT from &lt;em&gt;Knight Rider&lt;/em&gt;. It’d be so distracting on the road but seems exactly like the type of thing you’d see in, say, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uOiPi"&gt;By the way, none of this is meant as an insult to the car or its designers. It looks, to be frank, &lt;em&gt;rad as hell&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s easy to imagine a friendlier version that looks more like the family sedans of the era. But this concept, with a velvet and leather interior, is sinister in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLWWMe"&gt;If Hyundai actually started producing its concepts, though, the Heritage Series Grandeur isn’t the one I’d actually want to buy. The Heritage Series Pony is more my speed: a small, three-door concept that, I kid you not, has a Nixie tube speedometer and horsepower meter. It’s like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858725/honda-e-price-launch-date-battery-range"&gt;the Honda e&lt;/a&gt; (which I would really love to be available in America, Honda!) saw the original &lt;em&gt;RoboCop&lt;/em&gt; and started going through a weird phase that actually kind of works for them? I certainly find it more interesting than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20828319/hyundai-45-electric-concept-car-design-frankfurt-motor-show-2019"&gt;Hyundai’s last Pony-inspired concept&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bkDKSU58HHOe324OVM-xVvHX7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016957/brand_pony_exterior_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pony is my dream car — an EV that speaks more to the New Coke-sipping intern than the quaalude-pounding CEO speeding past them in a Grandeur.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nNBQu58vk9G3yBmafcJDkMnwp8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23016951/brand_pony_nixie_tubes_pc.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hyundai&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pony’s Nixie tube readout. Paging Steve Wozniak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hBLfhz"&gt;Unfortunately, it seems like both these cars are mostly just opportunities for Hyundai to show off both its creativity and its pixel-style lights that it promises will be a feature of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;an actual upcoming production EV&lt;/a&gt;. All I can do is hope that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/10/14215476/volkswagen-microbus-concept-id-buzz-emissions-scandal"&gt;like VW before it&lt;/a&gt;, Hyundai sees the stir its concepts caused and figures out some crash test-abiding way to release a real ‘80s revival car. It wouldn’t have to lovingly restore real cars from the era with a modern electric drivetrain (like it did with the Pony) to sell a car almost purely on nostalgia. It’s worked out pretty well for Ford with the Bronco, right?&lt;/p&gt;

In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser. \n\nNormally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request — or if you do, it may land you on a complicated-looking page headed “App &gt; Default apps.” Either way, here’s how to switch.",

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2rK6G7"&gt;If you’ve updated your PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may have noticed that when you click on a link for a website, a PDF document, or a variety of other file types, you will now be sent to Microsoft’s Edge browser. In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6FBt5H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8h8sJa"&gt;Normally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request — or if you do, it may land you on a complicated-looking page headed “App &amp;gt; Default apps.” Either way, here’s how to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IXoc02"&gt;Switch default browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPB00S"&gt;If you don’t want Edge to be your default browser, and your favorite browser isn’t offering to make the change for you — or if it did offer but instead sent you to the “Default apps” page — here’s how to switch the default. For this example, I’m using Google Chrome, but this should work with any browser that you have installed on your system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GQSVmd"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PKk51R"&gt;Under “Set defaults for applications,” either scroll down to where your preferred browser is listed or type the name in the “Search apps” field. Click on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDDskYt1jzHp3HLJw6aXzow1X2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908532/Screenshot__5_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BRZ48p"&gt;You’ll see a list of browser-related files, and under each file name, the app with which it is currently associated. In Windows 11, you can’t simply change your default browser with a single click — you have to change the assigned browser for every specific file type. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MCDLub"&gt;Look for the file types assigned to Edge, such as .HTM, .HTML, HTTP, HTTPS, and perhaps .PDF (unless you have a PDF reader you prefer). Click on the ones you want to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeVLc0rLMFwg4s4a8cFnjJJPU0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908534/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6e8TOE"&gt;You may get a “Before you switch” pop-up urging you to try Microsoft Edge — go ahead and click on “Switch anyway.” You’ll get a pop-up with a “Keep using this app” selection on top and your other installed browsers below. Go ahead and select the one you want to use. (Be aware that there may be some file types that won’t offer your browser as an alternative.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSqQpQeceV5bNmVJAzIzEy2Q6zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908535/Screenshot__8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10SILw"&gt;Note: by the time you read this, some browsers may have instituted a system for letting you more easily switch your default browser. For example, when this was written, the first time I opened Firefox, it asked if I wanted it to become the default. I let it go ahead, and when I went to the “Default apps” section of setup, I found that Firefox was now set as the default for .HTM, .HTML, .HTTP, and .HTTPS files. Edge was still listed for .PDF, .SHTML, .SVG, .XHT, and .XHTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOxLw8O3ehIDvA7Wfp9CIs56Yy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910128/Screenshot__92_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45S2Ao"&gt;One more thing: if you do open Edge for any reason, you will get the expected pop-up urging you to return to “recommended browser settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5F9mA7"&gt;That won’t solve everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QXShIl"&gt;But wait — there’s more. Even after you switch your browser default to something other than Edge, you’re still going to get Edge as the favored browser for a number of Windows apps. For example, bring up Windows 11’s new Widget pane (by clicking on the Widgets icon in your taskbar, the one that looks like a two-paned window), and click on one of the news items that appear there — and the link will open Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqLu97"&gt;If you find that irritating, there may be an app for that. In order to open Edge-specific links, you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eamg7s"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default Apps.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VY8eCQ"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom until you see “Choose defaults by link type.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ntL2zm"&gt;Click on that and then in the search box labeled “Set defaults for link types,” type “Edge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EqSQxy"&gt;Under the label “Microsoft-Edge, you’ll see “Microsoft Edge.” Click on that, and you’ll see any other browsers that you can use to open those specialized links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="F300zK"&gt;Interestingly, if you install Chrome or Firefox, you won’t see them as choices. But if you install the Brave browser, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; see it as an option — and if you select that, then whenever you click on a news link in the Widget pane, it will come up in Brave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set the Brave browser to open widget links." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HFKfj0oIvaoVtculNxl-nRcJ45g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22914500/Screenshot__10_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set the Brave browser to open widget links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YbkyaH"&gt;Another possibility is a tool called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector/releases__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xHc-FNSm%24"&gt;EdgeDeflector&lt;/a&gt; that was originally created to intercept any links in Windows 10 that were Edge-specific and rewrite them on the fly so that they can be opened by the default web browser. I did a little browsing and read that its latest version, v1.2.3.0, would work with Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42C5rv"&gt;I installed and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.daniel.priv.no/tools/edgedeflector/post-install.html__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xGOdR8WW%24"&gt;followed the directions for setup&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while that worked for most links, when I clicked on a link from the news sources in the Widgets pane, it didn’t quite work — the link opened in Chrome, but none of the graphics came through. I’d keep an eye on this app, though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="XPAcYE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10867159"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Now Alexa can tell Netflix to just ‘play something’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4rTJ4urq5mw02FevZdNdgxU2_ec=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146189/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RsuzA8"&gt;Over the last couple of years, Netflix has refined a one-button solution that picks something for you based on your tastes and starts playing it right away. It first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374543/netflix-shuffle-play-test-random-tv-movies"&gt;called the feature names like Shuffle&lt;/a&gt; and eventually landed on Play Something. The button has top positioning in its TV and mobile apps, but now things are even easier to activate, as Netflix has &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/111997"&gt;linked its automatic selector to Amazon’s voice-controlled AI&lt;/a&gt; and streaming hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFmS2WBHT-gLV2QzmqQ9RePSMTE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23017008/PlaySomething_Orange_1080x1080_S2KeyArt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wSjnIp"&gt;If you’re in the US or Canada, just say “Alexa, Play Something,” and if you have an Echo speaker or app listening in, plus a Fire TV device with Netflix activated, then that’s what will happen. In &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/alexa-play-something-on-netflix-e8d8f4fe5115"&gt;a post mentioning the feature&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix director of marketing partnerships Magno Herran says, “we are excited to partner with Fire TV to bring the Alexa voice technology to the Netflix Play Something feature. Now you can instantly discover a show or film we know you’ll love based on what you’ve watched before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJRCg6"&gt;Assuming you’ve already decided to live with a voice-controlled assistant, it could help you skip debating or scrolling through rows of titles at the start of each movie night. Even though many other devices and services include voice control, like Google Assistant, Roku, or Comcast, it appears that only Amazon has the Play Something command linked at the moment despite battling Netflix with its Prime Video product. The promotional materials mention it’s “available first on Fire TV,” so I’d expect to see it on other platforms eventually. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden signs $1 trillion infrastructure package into law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Participates In Tribal Nations Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0lc9WyBXWyoF0LuNVYqFoAwd10=/0x267:4000x2934/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146113/1236584326.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzFpPf"&gt;On Monday, President Biden signed a historic $1 trillion infrastructure bill aimed at repairing the nation’s roads and bridges along with investing billions into expanding access to broadband internet and bolstering the electrical grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBumOG"&gt;“For too long, we’ve talked about having the best economy in the world. We’ve talked about asserting American leadership in the world with the best and safest roads, railways, ports, and airports,” Biden said at Monday’s signing ceremony. “But today, we are finally getting it done. And my message to the American people is: America is moving again. And your life is going to change for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QKwGTa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“America is moving again”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw252J"&gt;The legislation is the largest federal investment in infrastructure in over a decade and the bill’s passage marks a significant and bipartisan win for the Biden administration’s domestic agenda. The package includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;$65 billion to improve broadband&lt;/a&gt; access with the goal of achieving universal connectivity by the end of the decade. Another $7.5 billion will go to building out a network of electric vehicle chargers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d75BxM"&gt;The infrastructure package also includes $50 billion to combat the effects of climate change and cyberattacks on national infrastructure and another $73 billion to improve the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MHbMe"&gt;At the beginning of this year, Biden intended to push through this infrastructure funding alongside an additional multi-trillion dollar investment in social programs and climate change. The infrastructure package that was signed into law Monday was sliced off of the broader social spending package and was approved by the Senate in August by a 69-30 vote. On November 5th, the House voted to approve the bill with 13 Republicans in support of the measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1OPcd"&gt;The second half of Biden’s domestic agenda — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751099/white-house-budget-climate-electric-vehicles-ev-tax-credit-deal-manchin-sinema"&gt;nearly $2 trillion&lt;/a&gt; — is still awaiting votes in the House and Senate. This additional spending measure includes $550 billion to combat climate change and $320 billion in expanded tax breaks over the next ten years to encourage electric vehicle and clean energy adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iu33SF"&gt;Outside of this bolstering of social services, the second package includes several benefits for consumers looking to purchase electric bicycles. If approved, the legislation would offer Americans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751273/ebike-tax-credit-build-back-better-biden"&gt;a refundable tax credit&lt;/a&gt; worth 30 percent of a new e-bike worth no more than $1,500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fl2J7"&gt;The plan also creates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759759/build-back-better-biden-laptop-tablet-low-income-manchin-sinema-broadband"&gt;a new $475 million Commerce Department grant program&lt;/a&gt; to help low-income Americans acquire desktops, laptops, and tablets. Community groups will be able to apply for grants in order to provide free or discounted devices for poor and previously incarcerated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1NZtN"&gt;Congress returned to Washington Monday to continue deliberation on the broader social spending package and move on other critical issues, like avoiding a potential government shutdown before December 3rd. It’s unclear when Congress will vote on social spending bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t34T3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU70jf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
