    <title>Miramax sues Quentin Tarantino over Pulp Fiction NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image reading TARANTINO NFTs, with a picture of John Travolta and Samuel Jackson from Pulp Fiction" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0zjZtkRfsKSua-YHfd4dTiYO3Yg=/142x0:2146x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155134/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_11.30.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tarantino NFTs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nxVBh0"&gt;Production company Miramax has sued director Quentin Tarantino over his non-fungible token or &lt;a href="https://tarantinonfts.com/"&gt;NFT collection&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21111461-miramax-tarantino-nft/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, filed yesterday in California court and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarkJKings/status/1460787218738339848"&gt;noted online&lt;/a&gt; by attorney Mark Jaffe, says NFTs don’t fall under Tarantino’s reserved rights for the film. Miramax accuses him of violating the company’s copyright and trademark, and it’s demanding a halt to the upcoming sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vg7BlN"&gt;Tarantino’s NFT collection is supposed to include blockchain tokens associated with high-resolution scans from his original handwritten screenplay of &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, plus a drawing inspired by some element of the scene. But Miramax alleges that Tarantino’s limited contractual rights for &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; — including interactive games, live performances, and other ancillary media — don’t cover NFTs linked with the film’s screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5JvA3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tarantino’s conduct may mislead other creators into believing they have the right to exploit Miramax films through NFTs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p4Miwx"&gt;Among other things, Miramax objects to Tarantino using &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; branding and imagery, saying that it’s likely to confuse buyers into thinking the NFTs are official Miramax products. And it says that while Tarantino has the right to “publish” pieces of the screenplay, NFTs don’t fall under that umbrella. “The proposed sale of a few original script pages or scenes as an NFT is a one-time transaction, which does not constitute publication,” the lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyu2Zd"&gt;The bigger issue isn’t Tarantino’s NFT lineup, specifically, but the precedent it could set for other filmmakers. “Tarantino’s conduct may mislead other creators into believing they have the right to exploit Miramax films through NFTs and other emerging technologies, when in fact Miramax holds those rights for its films.” Major film companies have released their own NFT collections for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574752/niftys-nft-space-jam-lebron-james-warner-looney-tunes"&gt;movies like &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so that’s not an abstract concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuDwTC"&gt;While this isn’t the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543753/jay-z-nft-lawsuit-reasonable-doubt-roc-a-fella-damon-dash"&gt;NFT-related lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the first legal tests of what an NFT actually &lt;em&gt;is — &lt;/em&gt;or at the very least, whether it’s comparable to any of the options Tarantino reserved. Miramax claims his rights include a static set of exceptions that “do not encompass any rights or media that were not known at the time of the original rights agreement,” while its own rights are “broad” and “catch-all.” By contrast, in a response to a cease and desist letter, Tarantino alleged that he’s basically publishing sections of a screenplay with additional embellishments like the drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QL8GM"&gt;NFTs are a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;frequently baffling&lt;/a&gt; but highly lucrative technology that’s provided an alternate revenue stream for people to profit off media &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399790/emily-ratajkowski-nft-christies-copyright-nightmare-richard-prince"&gt;outside traditional licensing deals&lt;/a&gt;. Tarantino’s NFTs are supposed to add a layer of “privacy and access control features” that will hide previously unknown secrets about his work — apparently inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nftdegenerates/video/7029741994981313797?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8i3AVqarZLKNe0h67HAxjMsZqBO3YZC9DBNzX3Sm%2Fz56TYh7jRKKF1ix%2Fs%2B9poztR3fhSO5%2BHOhDWgXNQGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=7029741994981313797&amp;amp;share_link_id=6C903C47-4607-4A72-BC37-8C6DA49708DD&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1637116437&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dl4ib4b426a8ma&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;a description of NFTs&lt;/a&gt; as having hidden “matrix code” inside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyoOMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook CX5 is the best Chromebook with a 15-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VMPUxM"&gt;Best Chromebook with a 15-inch screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qu3aaz"&gt;Folks may understandably balk at the Chromebook Flip CX5’s price, but it really is that good. It’s sturdy enough to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, and has a unique velvety texture that’s very pleasant to hold. Add a wide port selection, a smooth and comfortable keyboard, and a vivid display, and you’ve got a chassis that can hold its own against plenty of midrange Windows laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcLGGd"&gt;The CX5’s performance is equally impressive. We never once heard its fan in our testing, even when pushing a workload that slows most devices down. Battery life is quite satisfactory and easily lasted us all day. And the CX5 delivered some of the loudest audio we’ve ever heard from a Chromebook. While the CX5 isn’t a perfect device, it’s a solid performer all around. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UPS will make deliveries using Waymo’s autonomous Class 8 trucks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fkoi2_56XedN6KsU3HE_rgJh2-A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154859/vpavic_191202_3827_0042.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQ62UD"&gt;Waymo and UPS are expanding their nearly two-year-old partnership to include deliveries made using the Alphabet company’s fleet of autonomous Class 8 trucks. The companies had previously only conducted local deliveries using Waymo’s self-driving minivans; now, they will work together on longer-distance freight hauling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYs6x0"&gt;The deliveries will take place in Texas, where Waymo is building a nine-acre hub for its autonomous semi-trailer trucks. Starting now and lasting until the end of the year, Waymo and UPS will collaborate on freight hauling between facilities in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. The companies will gather data during the trial process, with an eye on safety and efficiency in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JviphK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gathering data, with an eye on safety and efficiency in particular&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Jx5GW"&gt;Currently, Waymo is testing the fifth generation of its “Driver,” which is the term used to describe its combination of hardware, sensors, and AI software, on its fleet of Class 8 trucks. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527430/waymo-jb-hunt-autonomous-truck-freight-test-texas"&gt;working with JB Hunt Transport Services&lt;/a&gt; to haul freight along several interstates in Texas and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt; is continuing its work with Daimler&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, on a fully autonomous, Level 4 system for trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syWFP0"&gt;While much of the public’s focus has been on Waymo’s autonomous minivans that operate in Arizona as part of a ride-hailing service, less attention has been paid to the company’s stated plans to eventually launch a commercial freight hauling business. Waymo has a fleet of Peterbilt trucks that have been retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors and software, and it is currently testing them in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078438/waymo-self-driving-minivans-trucks-texas-new-mexico"&gt;Arizona, California, and Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79DABw"&gt;The trucks operate autonomously during tests and commercial deliveries but include two Waymo employees — a commercially licensed driver and a software engineer — who sit in the cab and monitor the driving. Waymo has been working on autonomous trucks since 2017 and plans to eventually launch a full-scale freight hauling and delivery service called Waymo Via.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2qZ2X"&gt;For UPS, it’s an opportunity to realize a vision for the future where some of its delivery vehicles are electric, autonomous, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893655/ups-faa-approval-delivery-drones-airline-amazon-air-uber-eats-alphabet-wing"&gt;aerial drones&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to Waymo, UPS has conducted tests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20805994/ups-self-driving-trucks-autonomous-delivery-tusimple"&gt;using self-driving trucks designed by a startup called TuSimple&lt;/a&gt;. And it said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21112001/ups-waymo-self-driving-arrival-ev-delivery-vans"&gt;purchase 10,000 electric delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; from a UK startup called Arrival. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s FCC is still deadlocked, and net neutrality hangs in the balance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FCC Chair Ajit Pai Testifies Before Senate On Agency’s Oversight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P7_30JA9L8IZ_vz5lRX8KeAGcv0=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154775/1251769310.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYzz9l"&gt;After nearly 11 suspenseful months, the Senate is expected to hold a confirmation hearing on Biden’s recently appointed Federal Communications Commission chair on Wednesday. But the new chair will arrive in the middle of an agency stalemate that’s put net neutrality work on pause for Biden’s entire first year in office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kS94lH"&gt;Today, the Senate is expected to advance former FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel as chair of the commission — but it will take no action on Biden’s other nominee, and it will keep the FCC deadlocked with two Democrats, two Republicans, and one empty seat. Without a majority, Democrats will have little chance of bringing back Obama-era net neutrality rules, since the Republican commissioners remain deeply opposed to net neutrality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGhAsI"&gt;That stalemate, and the desire to keep the Trump-era rollback in place, has resulted in a surprising fight over the final open seat. In the weeks leading up to Wednesday’s hearing, several Republicans came out in opposition of Gigi Sohn’s nomination, accusing the telecom policy veteran of holding an unfair bias against conservatives — and making her path to nomination that much slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pQ9F4w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will do everything in my power to convince colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this extreme nominee.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1dDcY"&gt;“Gigi Sohn is a complete political ideologue who has disdain for conservatives. She would be a complete nightmare for the country when it comes to regulating the public airwaves,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1458222266395811849?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet thread last week&lt;/a&gt;. “I will do everything in my power to convince colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this extreme nominee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vY0bwA"&gt;“Sohn, obviously, her views are going to be very far apart from where mine are on all the issues,” said Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/01/manchinema-fcc-dems-net-neutrality-518324"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. “She’s very left, she’s going to be a heavy hand in regulation, very heavy in net neutrality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfg6dv"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-media-censor-for-the-fcc-gigi-sohn-joe-biden-nominee-11636408804"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;editorial board published an op-ed on November 8th suggesting that Sohn could use her position at the FCC to “censor conservative outlets.” Rupert Murdoch, conservative media tycoon, owns the&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ2rGg"&gt;That pushback is particularly stark given the relatively mild response to Rosenworcel, whose nomination was lauded by Republicans &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/wicker-backs-bidens-pick-for-fcc-chair-despite-net-neutrality"&gt;like Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmUMSK"&gt;A former counsel to Chairman Tom Wheeler during the Obama administration, Sohn is a prominent progressive advocate for net neutrality and additional regulatory restraints against telecom companies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746223/net-neutrality-fcc-jessica-rosenworcel-chair-gigi-sohn-ajit-pai-broadband"&gt;At a May &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, Sohn called on the FCC to regulate broadband even further under new net neutrality rules, urging commissioners to enforce new pricing and transparency measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKvgjv"&gt;Despite her desires to ramp up broadband enforcement, Republican claims that Sohn would act as a censor are unfounded. The&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;op-ed warned that Sohn could push for a new “fairness doctrine,” referring to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gigibsohn/status/1321456221740847106?s=20"&gt;an October 2020 tweet&lt;/a&gt; in which she said “Fox News has had the most negative impact on our democracy,” calling the network “state-sponsored propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GQSkw"&gt;The FCC’s Fairness Doctrine, instituted in 1949, required broadcasters to present controversial issues in an honest and equitable manner; essentially, devoting equal air time for stations to introduce these issues and counter them. The FCC abolished these rules in 1987. As former President Donald Trump ramped up criticisms over Big Tech as a potential censor of conservative views, Republicans discussed a possible new fairness doctrine for the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QQSa3k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sohn has repeatedly called a new fairness doctrine a “bugaboo of the right”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKDuTA"&gt;Sohn has repeatedly called a new fairness doctrine a “bugaboo of the right” that would be unlikely to go into effect, whether through new FCC rules or legislation, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/24/democrats-republicans-fake-news-471486"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlx0hl"&gt;“For over thirty years, Gigi has worked to defend and preserve the fundamental competition and innovation policies that have made broadband Internet access more ubiquitous, competitive, affordable, open, and protective of user privacy,” the White House said in its October announcement of Sohn’s nomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukjnZ5"&gt;Before Biden’s nomination announcements last month, sources told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Sohn was in the running to become chair herself. However, Sohn’s appointment fell out of favor likely due to anticipation of Republican pushback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiWFNo"&gt;Yet, even as some Senate Republicans and media organizations oppose Sohn’s nomination, other conservative networks have issued statements in favor of her confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGqWNb"&gt;“I know Gigi. I have worked with Gigi. And I have seen her fight for people’s right to express themselves, even when she disagrees with them,” Bradley Blakeman, former assistant and director of scheduling to former President George W. Bush, wrote in a Newsmax op-ed earlier this month. “I trust Gigi to get it right when it comes to protecting my free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jYQiv"&gt;OANN President Charles Herring said last week, “I’ve fought in the trenches side-by-side with Gigi Sohn for a number of years on multiple issues. I’m fully aware of Gigi’s personal views, yet I’m even more knowledgeable on her strong belief and advocacy for diversity in the programming lineup, especially in news, regardless of conflicts with her personal views.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QZVCO"&gt;Without Republican support for Sohn’s nomination, the future of net neutrality could come down to how moderate Democrats, primarily Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), decide to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0QD2t"&gt;Both Manchin and Sinema back Rosenworcel’s nomination for chair, but neither have made any public statements on Sohn. Sinema has repeatedly sided with Republicans on FCC-related issues. In 2019, Sinema refused to co-sponsor Senate Democrats’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304522/net-neutrality-save-the-internet-act-house-of-representatives-approval"&gt;Save the Internet Act&lt;/a&gt;, a bill that would permanently codify net neutrality rules into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aptCcH"&gt;“If the Biden administration and Senate Democrats want to go around saying that they’re fighting against corporate monopolies and to rein in the harm these companies cause, they need to prioritize this,” Evan Greer, a progressive tech advocate for Fight for the Future, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I’m still optimistic that they will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBH4MW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this story mislabeled a tweet from Gigi Sohn as being published in 2022. The tweet was published in 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Moto Watch 100 won’t run on Wear OS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Moto Watch 100 next to a phone showing the Moto OS app." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9gBBIGVoqeJ1vrlXSr34jVxq8U=/314x0:2018x1136/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154658/one_stop_shop_for_health.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Moto Watch 100 is opting for a proprietary OS over Wear OS. | Image: eBuyNow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uBzP3P"&gt;The original Motorola Moto 360 was one of the few good Wear OS (then Android Wear) smartwatches. At least, it was until Motorola quit the smartwatch game in 2016. It got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21162829/moto-360-review-smartwatch-third-gen-wearos-specs-features-price"&gt;remake in 2019&lt;/a&gt; under a different company, and two years later, eBuyNow just announced the Moto Watch 100, a cheaper, entry-level smartwatch. And for the first time, it will not run Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqkdp0"&gt;Instead, the new Moto Watch 100 features a proprietary software called Moto OS. This is a major departure from the Moto watches we’ve seen until now. That means it’ll be following in the footsteps of recent watches like the Huawei Watch 3, the OnePlus Watch, and every Fitbit smartwatch since the Ionic launched in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DHUYm"&gt;There are some clues in the Moto Watch 100 &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/16/2335156/0/en/Feel-Your-Rhythm-with-the-moto-watch-100.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; as to why. eBuyNow — a CE Brands subsidiary and Motorola’s “strategic brand partner” — says the Moto Watch 100 is aimed at first-time smartwatch users and will offer a “streamlined experience” for health and wellness. That, and on the &lt;a href="https://motowatch.com/moto-watch-100/"&gt;product website&lt;/a&gt;, it says Moto OS “dramatically increases battery life.” eBuyNow claims the Moto Watch 100 will get 14 days on a single charge and has built-in GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, and SpO2 sensors for measuring blood oxygen levels. Currently, there isn’t a Wear OS watch on the market that can do all that and last more than two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVAbL"&gt;On paper, the Moto Watch 100 offers an impressive spec sheet for a $99.99 smartwatch. In addition to its health features, it’s swim-proof with 5ATM of water resistance, supports quick charging, and has a 1.3-inch LCD display. But there’s one thing Moto OS won’t have: third-party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7DczH"&gt;That’s not always a deal-breaker. Fitbit’s gotten by on FitbitOS for years now and only has a handful of apps like Pandora, Starbucks, and Spotify. It also has &lt;a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/"&gt;an open SDK&lt;/a&gt; that lets developers create their own clock faces and apps to make up for the lack of choices in the Fitbit App Gallery. However, Fitbit is a major player in this space and other attempts have been less fortunate. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463529/huawei-watch-3-pro-harmonyos-smartwatch-features-specs"&gt;Huawei Watch 3&lt;/a&gt;, for example, had great hardware but HarmonyOS was limited to Huawei apps that weren’t all that useful. Meanwhile, OnePlus also tried to prioritize battery life at the expense of literally everything else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;It did not pay off&lt;/a&gt;. The OnePlus Watch was buggy to the point of being unusable when it launched in April. Two weeks of battery life wasn’t enough to make up for the OnePlus Watch’s glitchy software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tTjDe"&gt;Essentially, the Moto Watch 100 is taking a calculated risk. WearOS 2 is on its way out, but it’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;several months before Wear OS 3 arrives&lt;/a&gt;. Launching a new Wear OS watch right now won’t endear the company to anyone who isn’t familiar with its quirks. You only have to look as far as Fossil’s Gen 6 to see why. Whether this gamble pays off will entirely depend on Moto OS delivering a good-enough fitness tracking experience to make up for the lack of other smart features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTFn2E"&gt;The $99.99 Moto Watch 100 will be available for preorder in the US and Canada and comes in both black and silver. It’s also compatible with both iOS and Android, but iOS users will have to wait until December for the Moto iOS app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nissan’s upcoming electric SUV, the 2023 Ariya, will start at $47,125</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lfH1U_8ubtCQcQNgvTpkg1Y-lg=/58x0:5139x3387/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154602/Nissan_Ariya_006a.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5dwgwE"&gt;The 2023 Nissan Ariya, the automaker’s upcoming electric crossover SUV, finally has a sticker price. The company announced that the EV will start at $47,125, and that reservations are now being accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4gwcp"&gt;The Ariya, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324125/nissan-ariya-electric-suv-crossover-specs-price"&gt;which was first announced last summer&lt;/a&gt;, was expected to go on sale in Japan in the middle of 2021, followed by the US and Canada later in the year. But that’s been delayed, with North American customers not expected to receive deliveries until early fall 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NB32MO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nissan also revealed a bunch of new information about the various trim levels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTohgd"&gt;In addition to pricing, Nissan also revealed a bunch of new information about the various trim levels. The least expensive Ariya will cost buyers $47,125 (after a $1,175 destination charge), but the costs can reach over $60,000 when optioning out a top-of-the-line model. Nissan had originally said it expected the Ariya to start at $40,000. (Nissan is still eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit and various state incentives.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gnfu1p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10870616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYDSEA"&gt;Here’s a look at the various options: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0cxrn6"&gt;Ariya Venture Plus with front-wheel drive, an 87kWh battery, 238-horsepower AC synchronous motor, 221lb-ft of torque, up to 300-mile estimated range: $47,125 (with delivery charge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r0uqWw"&gt;Ariya Evolve Plus FWD with 87kWh battery, 238-horsepower AC synchronous motor, 221lb-ft of torque, up to 285-mile estimated range: $50,125&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uI3R5I"&gt;Ariya Premiere FWD with 87kWh battery, 238-horsepower AC synchronous motor, 221lb-ft of torque, up to 285-mile estimated range: $54,625&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G0TW1S"&gt;Ariya Platinum Plus with all-wheel drive, e-4ORCE dual motor all-wheel control, 87kWh battery, 389-horsepower AC synchronous motor, 442lb-ft of torque, up to 265-mile estimated range: $60,125&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="J8h6Au"&gt;Nissan is also offering discounts on charging at EVgo charging stations to the first 10,000 people who make reservations before January 31st, 2022. The discounts amount to a two-year free EVgo membership plus $500 in charging credits upon purchase. Deposits are $500, fully refundable, and can be placed at the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/ariya/reserve/premiere"&gt;new web portal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dGoEG"&gt;Like the majority of the auto industry, Nissan has promised to make and sell more electric vehicles. The company is targeting that more than 40 percent of its US vehicle sales by 2030 will be fully electric, with even more to be electrified (meaning hybrids and plug-in hybrids). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YhGDQM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nissan has long been a leader in electric vehicle sales&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1Nowb"&gt;Nissan has long been a leader in electric vehicle sales, despite really only having one EV — the functional-if-uninspiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/6/16258688/2018-nissan-leaf-photos-tokyo-launch-event"&gt;Nissan Leaf hatchback&lt;/a&gt; — on the market. The company unveiled the Ariya against the backdrop of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-50964040"&gt;corporate turmoil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/09/nissan-ceo-saikawa-to-step-down-on-september-16.html"&gt;executive turnover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nissan-counts-suv-and-ev-product-offensive-spark-rebound-europe"&gt;plummeting sales&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-03/nissan-ready-for-deeper-cost-cuts-as-business-worsens-ceo-says"&gt;pandemic-related cost-cutting&lt;/a&gt; at Nissan. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/business/carlos-ghosn-arrest.html"&gt;The arrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/business/carlos-ghosn-escape.html"&gt;subsequent escape&lt;/a&gt; of Carlos Ghosn, former chairman of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, dominated the headlines for much of 2019, casting a spotlight on an automaker that appeared to be at war with itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1rlhU"&gt;As such, the Ariya is the first major new product launch in the post-Ghosn era for the company — and a chance to turn over a new leaf (pun intended). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6c4AW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9zSMj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 15 goes up for preorder, shipping December 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GhNr2xqDUROskesk7VYkKAc7d2E=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154555/echo_show_15_media_lifestyle_6.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eX2mSJ"&gt;Today, Amazon is opening up preorders for its largest Alexa-enabled smart display yet, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/introducing-echo-show-15-smart-display-with-alexa/dp/B08MQLDFF6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;. The $249.99 device has a 15.6-inch 1080p touchscreen that can be oriented in portrait or landscape, and can either be mounted on a wall or placed on a countertop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvSu4O"&gt;Announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"&gt;in late September&lt;/a&gt;, the Echo Show 15 is designed to act as a communal hub for families and show useful information like calendar appointments, reminders, and to-do lists. It shows these in permanent home screen widgets, which are displayed alongside a more typical assortment of news headlines like previous Echo Shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ceavvl5KxQQ-3UT2TXgIAqOg5lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021355/Echo_Show_15_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It can also be oriented vertically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bUVNUtAGKCSEvW3zrltyu2Y4CNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021356/echo_show_15_media_lifestyle_09_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or placed on a countertop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MSVJan"&gt;As well as these communal features, the Echo Show 15 can also act as a standalone entertainment device. It’s Amazon’s first smart display that supports 1080p streams from the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video and can also act as a photo frame, has a 5-megapixel camera for video calls, and can display a feed from a compatible security camera or video doorbell in a picture-in-picture view. There’s no mention of YouTube support, however, so expect to fire up the built-in web browser if you want to access it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review#:~:text=watching%20youtube%20videos%20also%20remains%20a%20laughably%20bad%20experience%20that%20involves%20accessing%20the%20youtube%20mobile%20site%20through%20the%20echo%20show%2010%E2%80%99s%20built-in%20web%20browser%2C%20though%20at%20least%20you%20can%20do%20it%20via%20a%20voice%20command."&gt;like with previous Echo Show devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLZfKX"&gt;The Echo Show 15 is due to ship on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Axiom Space reveals science that will be done on first crewed flight to the ISS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7K9IkIEyDFFRai3duIPwPsbbTes=/0x0:6048x4032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154415/iss056e201174.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Space Station&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kYhW40"&gt;Private space habitat company Axiom is &lt;a href="https://www.axiomspace.com/press-kit-ax1-research"&gt;revealing the science&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s first private astronauts will do when they travel to the International Space Station (ISS) next year. The research experiments include working with stem cells to gauge how space impacts aging as well as performing a two-way 3D hologram projection demonstration using a Microsoft HoloLens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAxAAw"&gt;These and other experiments will be performed by four crew members whom Axiom plans to send to the ISS in February 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;part of the company’s Ax-1 mission&lt;/a&gt;. The crew will fly to the space station inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that Axiom purchased in March 2020. It’s actually the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465134/spacex-axiom-space-sign-bulk-deal-private-crew-dragon-missions"&gt;first of many SpaceX Crew Dragon flights&lt;/a&gt; that Axiom bought from SpaceX in order to send people back and forth to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuZgWV"&gt;The four fliers on board Ax-1 include Michael López-Alegría, the mission’s commander and a former NASA astronaut who now works for Axiom, along with three paying customers. Larry Connor, an American nonprofit activist investor; Mark Pathy, a Canadian investor; and Eytan Stibbe, an Israeli investor and former Israeli fighter pilot, each paid $55 million to ride on board Ax-1. They are also the ones who helped to decide on the 25 research experiments they’ll be doing while on board the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R9aSZF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These crew don’t really want a whole lot of spare time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMnbj2"&gt;“These crew don’t really want a whole lot of spare time,” Christian Maender, director of in-space manufacturing and research at Axiom Space, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They’re planning on filling most of their time with science, believe it or not. For the little time that they are going to create for themselves, they just expressed an interest in taking opportunities to take in the views a little bit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZSkaF"&gt;Ax-1 is set to launch on top of one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets in February, spending two days in orbit while reaching the International Space Station. Once the crew has docked with the orbiting lab, they’ll spend eight days on board, conducting their research alongside the NASA astronauts, German astronaut, and Russian cosmonauts currently living on the ISS. The research should take up to 100 hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/quDgRyt70KroCR3ybGdwwEddftk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260805/Ax1_Crew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Axiom Space&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ax-1 crew (from L to R): Michael López-Alegría, Mark Pathy, Larry Connor, and Eytan Stibbe. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O5XII8"&gt;Connor is the one who will be working with stem cells in coordination with the Mayo Clinic, studying how space travel affects heart health and senescent cells — aged cells that no longer divide and grow. Pathy, meanwhile, has up to 12 experiments on his plate, including a hologram demonstration. NASA has already demonstrated one-way “holoportation” bringing up the image of someone on the ground onto the space station, using a HoloLens. But Pathy will show that a two-way dialogue is possible, sending his image down to Earth while the image of the person he is talking to comes to him on the station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94kTar"&gt;“What it really plays into is opportunities for more longer duration spaceflight and more deep spaceflight,” Maender says, “where you are really talking about wanting to create a human connection between your crew — no matter where they’re traveling — and back to someone on the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0x8rF"&gt;Stibbe will be taking part in his own mission called Rakia, named “after the dome (atmosphere) created by God on the second day after the firmament, which protects life on Earth,” according to Axiom. The goal of his research is to “connect the younger generation in Israel” by doing science and artistic endeavors, with experiments drawing on disciplines ranging from astrophysics to neuroscience. López-Alegría will help out with all of this research, as well as serve as a human subject for some of the experiments aimed at learning more about how space impacts the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCIAsq"&gt;Axiom considers Ax-1 the first of many missions. The company was founded in 2016 by Mike Suffredini, the former ISS program manager at NASA, and it has the ultimate goal of building private space stations that various customers can visit to do research. Axiom holds a contract with NASA to attach a module to the ISS as early as 2024, testing out the company’s habitat technology. That mission is part of a larger goal to expand to a free-flying space station called “Axiom Station.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frYko2"&gt;With that larger target in mind, Ax-1 and the follow-up SpaceX Crew Dragon missions will all help Axiom better understand how to get people to space safely and what kinds of work they can do in orbit when they get there. “It’s a demonstration mission for us in a lot of ways,” says Maender. “Demonstrating how we can open up more opportunities for research in microgravity beyond what can be done on the on the ISS today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbB34X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKb58l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7WpNd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFT makers are trying to build the next Disney</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SdJKCnIaYFLvIUYjciNGX4LtYOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154365/acastro_211115_4866_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s a long way to go&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KlAjAk"&gt;In the online auction market OpenSea, you can pay around $600 to buy a portrait of a robot in streetwear — and, if you’re lucky, a stake in a new media empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="ibOJUG"&gt;The robot is called a TARS, and it’s part of the Voguverse, an elaborate 37th-century mythos involving space arcologies, a nuclear war, and interstellar travel. The portrait is one of countless digital assets being sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. But by pairing its fictional universe with a blockchain-based ledger, the creators think they can tap into a new way to tell stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be9QD4"&gt;As NFTs explode in popularity, entrepreneurs are imagining an entire media industry that’s built around them. At its most ambitious, the vision is sometimes dubbed a “decentralized Disney”: a world of fictional crossovers like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its many spinoffs but where different characters and creative properties are owned by a panoply of fans, not a single company. Talent agencies, comics authors, and countless NFT enthusiasts are buying in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avAx3f"&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; mean? Many are still figuring that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Images of a hat, glasses, and jewelry in neon style." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piSL7e5rZww3j9YrmuYVRjdlgf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021480/acastro_211115_4866_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aRLqDl"&gt;Over the past couple of years, NFTs — essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;certificates of ownership inscribed on a cryptocurrency blockchain&lt;/a&gt; — have exploded into a lucrative and growing market. Some of the most sought-after NFTs are collectibles: typically limited edition runs of unique, automatically generated avatars or other items. The most popular tokens can sell for millions of dollars in sales that are more like an art auction than a bitcoin trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keMuhY"&gt;NFTs have made the biggest waves in the fine art world, and some NFT collectibles series are united by an aesthetic rather than a concrete narrative. CryptoPunks, the best-known example, are a set of 10,000 mostly human pixelated portraits. But many are based in some kind of fictional setting. At its simplest, this might look like the city of “Arctopolis,” where Chill City NFT penguins live and work. At its most complex, it might involve something like the Voguverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A city street scene of penguins driving on ice roads with igloo houses on the corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nlx73TQ8Fir6GMtYrunn6VmSe2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018440/60a1befaac554e547aaaf723_ChillCityTown.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chill City&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art depicting the home of Chill City NFT penguins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KpIpyS"&gt;The Voguverse lore is laid out on a web page explaining the backstory of the TARS, a name that stands for “Tether Assisted Robotic Skeleton.” In the far future, Earth is uninhabitable, and humans live in space-bound “hives” ruled by a galactic government and mega-corporations that deal in cryptocurrency. (A lot of NFT lore involves crypto fans getting rich.) People use TARS telepresence bots to revisit their home planet, buying models that reflect their personalities and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esn61L"&gt;Vogu founder Andrew Trackzy sees TARS as a potential building block for the next big media intellectual property, or IP. “Our goals for Vogu and this IP is to grow it to a large-scale worldwide IP, just like Star Wars, just like Pokémon,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Even if Vogu doesn’t hit this bar, he thinks some other project will. “I do believe that — whether it’s us or another project that comes before or after us — that someone in the NFT space will create the next big worldwide IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37ZkiS"&gt;He’s not alone. Some NFT series involve formal media tie-ins, like Stoner Cats, a collectible that’s funding an animated series featuring Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane. Other creators have struck open-ended deals to leverage their fame: CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/"&gt;signed to Hollywood talent agency UTA&lt;/a&gt; in August, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club is represented by U2 and Madonna manager Guy Oseary. Trackzy says Vogu is currently talking with several potential media partners and working on a webtoon set in the Voguverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BxFbr"&gt;Trackzy’s plan mimics the strategy of building powerhouse media franchises from toy lines like &lt;em&gt;GI Joe&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt;. NFTs have some crucial differences from action figures, however, beyond being harder for kids to play with. For one thing, many buyers are seeking a fast-growing investment rather than an art piece or a toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="53INwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Most people probably aren’t calling up &lt;em&gt;Thundercats&lt;/em&gt; and being like, dude, Lion-O did not have the screen time in the last episode that I needed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIo2ou"&gt;“With an action figure, most people probably aren’t calling up &lt;em&gt;Thundercats&lt;/em&gt; and being like, dude, Lion-O did not have the screen time in the last episode that I needed,” says Trackzy, referencing the 1980s TV series. “As a project, you’re constantly under pressure from your community to increase the value of that collectible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIl6wq"&gt;Because each NFT avatar is unique, buyers can also forge a connection with a genuinely (if only slightly) one-of-a-kind character. Some NFT buyers make fan art of their purchases, while others spin entire independent stories around them like Jenkins the Valet, a character built around a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT. If one of these stories blows up, it can raise the profile of the entire lineup. The buyers can sell their NFT if they want to move on to another project, and unlike an action figure, the person who minted the NFT can collect a royalty every time a collectible changes hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11VkoC"&gt;To NFT proponents like investor Drew Austin — who’s working on his own community NFT narrative project — that mix marks the birth of a new media model. “We are putting the foundation in place so that people can use their imagination and create stories and content and experiences with their own characters that they own through this because it’s an NFT,” says Austin. “The ability to be able to leverage the community, to be able to expand on IP and to create a universe, I think, is a really exciting concept.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O39Jd3"&gt;The dream might sound intuitive in the world of modern media franchises, where giant games and blockbuster movies are shaped by convoluted licensing deals for beloved figures like Spider-Man. Instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/16/17461884/marvel-fans-fox-comcast-deal-x-men-mcu"&gt;rooting for a giant corporate merger&lt;/a&gt; that might let the X-Men hang out with the Avengers, fans could directly collaborate to have their favorite characters share the same fictional world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of an action figure in a package in neon style." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCQ3JYRe9tCOERRrJd6nbVKRbmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021483/acastro_211115_4866_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bWmKnB"&gt;For believers, NFTs and entertainment IP rights seem like a perfect match — an emerging market with overwhelming possibilities and hype paired with a billion-dollar industry in dire need of disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3E1Cyu"&gt;But owning a fictional character and owning an NFT mean very different things, and the two forms of ownership don’t neatly overlap. It’s an often overlooked but incredibly important distinction that much of the NFT world is still grappling with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zVMfr"&gt;To explain why, we have to dig into how NFTs and intellectual property work. NFTs are, at an incredibly oversimplified level, entries on a database called a blockchain. These entries represent (or sometimes directly encode) a file or even a physical object, and an entry is linked with a specific cryptocurrency wallet. “Owning” an NFT means having its entry associated with a digital wallet you control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTysKQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFTs don’t confer any specific, universal set of legal rights&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knQ7PY"&gt;“Owning” a media property, by contrast, typically means that you hold the copyrights and trademarks associated with it. A copyright — again, at an incredibly simplified level — is an exclusive, automatically granted legal right to sell copies of a creative work or produce other media based on it. A trademark stops other people from selling commercial goods with a name or mark that you’ve registered with an agency like the US Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRzCgF"&gt;NFTs don’t confer a specific set of legal rights. If anything, part of their appeal is supposed to be that you don’t need a government involved in enforcing their ownership. By contrast, copyright and trademark are complex legal frameworks enforced by individual countries and international bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmH5Au"&gt;Some NFT collectibles, like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/veve-collectibles/disney-golden-moments-walt-disney-mickey-mouse-9821fb07fdd7"&gt;a new lineup sold by Disney&lt;/a&gt;, basically operate at the level of trading cards and confer no rights to the underlying art. But other NFT sellers do try to outline some kind of intellectual property framework. They draw up terms of service, laying out which legal rights they’re allowing buyers to exercise. Owning the NFT (in the “having a wallet linked to its entry” sense) signals that both parties have agreed to this contract. If one side breaks it, the two parties could go to court, the same way you could sue over any broken contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pair of Vogu TARS robots in streetwear with the titles “Core” and “Kouwei” collection" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG399A_UhFKZ8vBC2AX884GcJOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018449/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_8.34.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Vogu Collective&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voguverse robot NFTs are part of a complex fictional universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7GwX"&gt;But these contracts vary widely. Holding a &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/chill-city-nft-collectibles"&gt;Chill City penguin&lt;/a&gt; NFT allows you to print non-commercial “one-off units” of T-shirts or other items depicting the penguin. A Bored Ape Yacht Club agreement lets you sell merchandise or derivative works depicting your ape, although you can only use the phrase “Bored Ape” to reference the NFT number. CryptoKitties uses the &lt;a href="https://www.nftlicense.org/"&gt;NFT License&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt at a standardized NFT intellectual property framework. Cool Cats offers a single sentence saying users are “free to do anything” with their digital cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMw8c5"&gt;Even a fairly generous NFT deal isn’t the equivalent of Disney owning the Avengers, as you’ll see if you look at lore-heavy collectibles like Vogu’s TARS. Vogu’s terms of service give TARS owners an exclusive copyright license to an image of a robot with the NFT’s specific combination of features. If Vogu wants to depict that exact robot in its media, the contractual deal it struck with the current owner says it needs to either get their permission or buy it back from them. The company apparently spent $16,000 reacquiring one besuited robot to use it as a fictitious in-universe CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11CTJH"&gt;But buying the NFT doesn’t give you any intellectual property rights to the underlying details of the Voguverse, like the backstory of the robots or the term “TARS.” If you wanted to make a cartoon starring your TARS without Vogu’s active approval, you’d have to invent a whole new sci-fi world complete with new names for everything — as Trackzy puts it, &lt;em&gt;Robot Dude In A Kimono&lt;/em&gt; is acceptable,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but &lt;em&gt;Vogu Kimono Guy&lt;/em&gt; is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FX28jC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you look at a CryptoPunk, it sort of served as inspiration to us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YKeryI"&gt;NFT creators can also bypass buyers by designing a non-minted media character in the style of their collectibles. If Vogu had really wanted to avoid paying for a CEO that looked like a specific TARS, it could have made a nearly identical robot but added an extra accessory. For future projects, the Vogu Collective plans to hold virtual casting calls for cameo roles, but its major characters won’t be drawn from the TARS NFT lineup. Other creators take similar tacks: &lt;em&gt;Stoner Cats&lt;/em&gt; isn’t selling NFTs of its main characters, for example — it’s offering collectibles recombining their attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRMlFw"&gt;“We wanted artists in the space to be able to exercise their creativity and use what they purchase. That’s part of the value of owning these assets,” says Trackzy. “At the end of the day, it’s a business decision that we had to make, to make sure that the community was happy with the rights that we gave them. But we also have to make sure that when I go and sit down with Universal Studios, they’re comfortable that they can make a movie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wlyuKj"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NX3I7x"&gt;Many NFT sellers still want people to play in their sandboxes. Unlike Disney, a company notorious for ruthless copyright crackdowns, plenty of them welcome fan works, including for-profit add-on NFT series. But that’s not unusual for small creative projects of any stripe, and a lot of collaborations involve handshake approval or one-off licensing deals, not an automatic blockchain contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFFpwt"&gt;The team behind Jenkins the Valet says they’ve been collaborating with BAYC since the beginning of the project. “Our teams are working together to make sure that everyone is protected, and we will continue to exercise due care to make sure that their IP is expressed in a positive way that does not contradict what they are building,” they wrote in an email. (That said, they won’t be using the Bored Ape branding in their work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ssp7ZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted artists in the space to be able to exercise their creativity and use what they purchase. That’s part of the value of owning these assets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FpY4Du"&gt;The Vogu Collective also grants licensing permissions on a case-by-case basis, including to people who don’t own its NFT. One TARS-less fan is currently building a Voguverse-themed tabletop role-playing game based on the freely available &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; ruleset, thanks to an informal agreement that gives Vogu final approval rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The cover of Punks #1 comic" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/db2CvPeM4qhxU7qC34Ogg5OQC9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021492/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_8.20.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Pixel Vault&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The cover of Punks #1 comic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hvSTqC"&gt;Some people are making NFT-based art without this kind of top-down approval, but they’re treading carefully around thorny ownership issues. &lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; comic — one of multiple comics and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/the-world-s-largest-record-company-is-creating-an-nft-super-group?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;at least one band&lt;/a&gt; involving team-ups between different NFT avatars — is based on portraits from the CryptoPunks lineup. While Pixel Vault members own the avatars in question, Pixel Vault founder Sean Gearin says they haven’t been able to contact CryptoPunks creator Larva Labs for approval. Instead, the company enlisted three teams of lawyers to create a “100 percent unique” intellectual property inspired by the collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVQYub"&gt;Punk #8146 of CryptoPunks, for instance, is a tiny and nameless figure with a barely visible cigarette and a propeller beanie. &lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; protagonist Beanie has the same hat and cigarette, but he’s got a backstory as a former busboy who becomes a digital art kingpin, and he’s drawn in a far more detailed comic-book style. “When you look at a CryptoPunk, it sort of served as inspiration to us, but when you look at the comic itself, it bears no resemblance really to the original art of Larva Labs,” says Gearin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJHRBM"&gt;Pixel Vault’s process resembles a fandom strategy called &lt;a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Filing_Off_The_Serial_Numbers"&gt;filing off the serial numbers&lt;/a&gt;, where authors change names and world details to make original stories out of fanfiction. This also happens in traditional comics: &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol’s&lt;/em&gt; Willoughby Kipling was created as a direct stand-in for &lt;em&gt;Hellblazer’s&lt;/em&gt; John Constantine, and Marvel’s Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool) &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2016/1/28/10860668/deadpool-deathstroke-deadshot"&gt;began as a near-clone&lt;/a&gt; of DC’s Slade Wilson (aka Deathstroke.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XivMn"&gt;NFTs play an important social role here. If Pixel Vault didn’t own the individual CryptoPunks it’s drawing inspiration from, &lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; would probably draw community censure and pressure from Larva Labs. But the blockchain isn’t replacing long-standing legal maneuvers — or changing the fact that you don’t need a license to get inspired by a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Images of avatar faces in a neon style." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GwJR89rvKD1YDGPDX3k-pM_ZO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021486/acastro_211115_4866_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPbAtC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punks&lt;/em&gt; is only a jumping-off point for Pixel Vault, which is trying its own ambitious approach to NFT storytelling. That’s the Metahero Universe: a nascent franchise built by a core creative team but run partly by fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD63VO"&gt;Metahero started with a series of generative NFT avatars representing heroes and villains. Pixel Vault wants it to include a series of comic books and a big-budget massively multiplayer game. To manage this, it’s founded a series of planet-themed decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmLL9V"&gt;DAOs are essentially groups of token holders who pool their resources and vote on decisions, similar to shareholders at a company. This system offers broad decentralized decision-making rather than ownership of a specific character. It could also add complications to the already difficult process of designing a video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL4Ap0"&gt;Building a Metahero game could be tough under any circumstances. When I spoke to Pixel Vault, the company had a 17-person staff whose background mostly wasn’t in game design. (It’s apparently considering partnering with a larger studio.) With the DAO structure, NFT holders are supposed to pick the game’s genre — like a battle royale title or a more traditional MMO — and then vote on numerous decisions throughout development, to the point of firing an entire creative team. It’s an intriguing experiment, but it also sounds a bit like running a Kickstarter campaign for a piece of video game concept art and promising to let backers run the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lfxgxG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think self-preservation will ultimately rule the day”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7e70qO"&gt;If a game is open to non-DAO members, as Gearin says the Metahero MMO will be, the structure also seems to encourage a fandom crypto-aristocracy. Pixel Vault wants to balance the experience so players without an expensive NFT could join and have fun, even if more money offers visual flair or special abilities. But in theory, DAO holders could simply order the developer to let them steamroll every other player in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjEzm9"&gt;Gearin thinks DAO members will avoid this because they’re invested in the overall long-term health of the game. “I think self-preservation will ultimately rule the day. So even if initially, they like the idea of ‘We want to be able to pay to win,’ ultimately that’s going to stunt the growth of the game, right?” he says. “The community can ultimately decide what they will, and it will be somewhat unpredictable. But at the end of the day, people typically act in what they believe their own best interest is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCVzHC"&gt;In case they don’t, Pixel Vault has an escape hatch: it controls 45 percent of the voting power in any decision. The planetary DAOs control another 45 percent, and 10 percent is tied up in a “founders DAO” that’s not associated with Pixel Vault but composed of early adopters who support its vision. “It’s kind of like the little security to help ensure that the best decision gets made if we indeed have the best decision,” Gearin says. But at least, in theory, all the DAOs could unite against their creator — taking the universe in any direction they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JAZA0Y"&gt;
&lt;p id="38yEcS"&gt;While Metahero is an organized attempt to create a decentralized media franchise, some NFT creators are taking the opposite tack: starting with a tantalizingly skeletal collectible, then encouraging NFT owners to build a fan-made world around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HL8qj2"&gt;The best example of this is Loot, created by Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann. Loot bags are procedurally generated lists with a &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons-&lt;/em&gt;like fantasy flavor: Loot Bag #980’s contents include “Crown” and “Demon Husk;” #2073 includes “Shoes,” “Necklace,” and “‘Rune Root’ Quarterstaff of Giants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXBgqg"&gt;Since launching in August, the text-based Loot bags have inspired a dedicated fandom. Buyers made art depicting their bag’s contents and formed guilds with people who own the same item, while other creators designed independent NFTs that pair with the bags. If you own a Loot Bag, you can do things like generate a custom Loot Character, a pixelated avatar wearing or holding items from the bag. The Loot Character is then minted as an NFT that’s permanently linked with the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oKAx1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As soon as you make it formal, it starts to feel much more like you’re engaging with a corporation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DObPPe"&gt;A Loot Character team member who goes by Moniker says the group talks regularly with the core Loot team. But the whole enterprise is deliberately informal. There’s no hard answer to who holds the rights to Loot Characters’ art or even the name of the project since it’s derivative of the original Loot NFT lineup. “It’s sort of a bit of a handshake at this point,” Moniker says. “As soon as you make it formal, it starts to feel much more like you’re engaging with a corporation than you are a bunch of folks that are just really excited about a project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A procedurally generated Loot Character" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8MVBgD_iIJcH-LqKSOo-necL8A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021495/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_8.22.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Loot Character&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A procedurally generated Loot Character&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tXs2pU"&gt;Some other projects have followed Loot’s formula, like Adventure Cards, which generates the names of cards for a nonexistent &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;-style game. Adventure Cards has inspired its own community-built augmentations, including a simple but playable digital game. “I want people to feel like they can own the cards and be inspired by the cards, as long as everyone is explicit about what their contribution is,” says Adventure Cards creator Paul McKellar, previously a member of Square’s founding team. “I’d like to do whatever, honestly, lets people do as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzNVKc"&gt;But NFT creators’ commitment to openness generally hasn’t extended to a formal system for sharing ownership of the world, at least not yet. “I think that it’s really yet to be determined what the best ways of leading the communities are,” McKellar says. One possibility is a DAO composed of people who have contributed to the Adventure Cards universe. If a company wanted to adapt the series for film or TV, they’d work with the DAO to sign a deal, and DAO members could split the profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GVCKn6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s really yet to be determined what the best ways of leading the communities are”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGmfaT"&gt;That’s a starkly different model from some older web art. The &lt;a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/"&gt;SCP Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, is a wiki composed of thousands of fictitious paranormal incident reports written by a plethora of authors. The entries are licensed under Creative Commons, an alternative copyright model that lets anybody remix or build on a work. The Creative Commons system requires that all the original stories and any adaptations must be distributed freely, and the wiki itself warns creators that they won’t be getting rich. That guaranteed legal safety, however, has turned SCP into a far bigger decentralized media universe than any NFT project. On top of its reports’ collaborative interlocking narrative, it serves as the source material for spinoff novels, video games, and short films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDczii"&gt;To some fandom veterans, NFT projects’ murky ownership questions mean collaborative blockchain storytelling doesn’t look like a revolutionary new medium, just the latest attempt to monetize fan labor. In late October, six young adult fiction authors &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/inside-realms-of-ruin-ya-novelists-failed-nft-project/"&gt;spurred a community backlash&lt;/a&gt; with a project called Realms of Ruin: a fantasy world where the authors would compose origin stories and fans would write tie-ins that they could mint as NFTs. It wasn’t clear who would control the copyright to these tie-in stories, and potential participants worried they were giving up legal ownership in exchange for blockchain tokens. The creators, apparently surprised by the negative response, shut down the project within hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vNqN9T"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AXHlXR"&gt;It’s not clear that NFTs make it easier to craft new art from old art, nor that they would help settle common copyright conflicts. Countless copyright cases revolve around fair use, a situation where proving ownership is beside the point. Other cases, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691842/disney-marvel-sues-comic-artist-iron-man-avengers"&gt;Disney’s long feud with Marvel comics veterans&lt;/a&gt;, hinge on the precise terms of a contract. A blockchain &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help prevent works from being “orphaned,” or dropped into a limbo where the rightsholder can’t be found, except that cryptocurrency owners &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/tens-of-billions-worth-of-bitcoin-have-been-locked-by-people-who-forgot-their-key.html"&gt;lose or forget keys all the time&lt;/a&gt; and many transactions are anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuVVo1"&gt;Meanwhile, trying to use NFTs as a proxy for copyright raises its own concerns. If you do something like buy a superhero avatar, write a comic book about the hero, and sell the underlying avatar, there’s no clear norm about whether the new buyer should expect the rights to your comic. If Netflix wants to make a TV series about that comic, it’s even less clear how many people it would need to sign a deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eNHpLw"&gt;And ultimately, while NFT owners might love their digital characters, companies still own the names and stories that give them meaning. “Are these individually owned NFTs going to hit Main Street? If you can’t use the Bored Ape Yacht Club name — you’re just a cool picture of a monkey. If you can’t use the Vogu name — you are just a cool picture of a robot,” says Trackzy. “We still have a long way, I think, for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First ever YouTube video edited by co-founder to predict ‘decline’ of the platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zd7ssraebRp6KAN8yAq-Avc5Ums=/0x20:480x340/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154351/jawed_karim_at_the_zoo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim edited the description to YouTube’s first ever video (above) to make his opinion known. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkSkPL"&gt;Jawed Karim, the third co-founder of YouTube, has condemned the platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773299/youtube-dislike-button-hide-public-count-numbers-small-creator-protection"&gt;removal of public dislike counts&lt;/a&gt; on videos, suggesting that the change will lead to YouTube’s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwFVri"&gt;“Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed,” writes Karim. “The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mulkmj"&gt;YouTube made the change to its UI last week, saying it removed public dislikes in order to counter harassment and promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” But many YouTuber users and creators have criticized the decision, arguing that dislike counts give the community a way to express its preferences as well as quickly identify misleading and spam videos promoted by YouTube’s own algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQJyUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqE9cX"&gt;Karim has been getting his own message out in an unusual way: by editing the description to the first video ever uploaded to YouTube, a banal clip titled “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw"&gt;Me at the zoo”&lt;/a&gt; which stars the 25-year-old Karim himself. Karim originally edited the description of the video a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/13/youtube-me-at-the-zoo-dislike-protest/amp/"&gt;few days ago&lt;/a&gt; to read: “When every YouTuber agrees that removing dislikes is a stupid idea, it probably is. Try again, YouTube [face palm emoji].” But this morning he changed this description once again to give a more detailed condemnation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2RxyQ"&gt;“The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform,” writes Karim. “Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. [...] The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vySy4g"&gt;It’s not the first time Karim has used the “Me at the zoo” video as an informal billboard for his opinions on the platform. In 2013, when YouTube announced it would use Google Plus to power comments — a move which many saw as a way for the search giant to force increased engagement for its doomed social network — Karim &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/08/youtube-cofounders-first-public-comment-in-8-years-why-the-f-do-i-need-a-google-account-to-comment-on-a-video/"&gt;changed the video’s description&lt;/a&gt; to read: “why the fuck do i need a google+ account to comment on a video?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uddM4j"&gt;In his statement today, Karim compares the video in which Matt Koval, YouTube’s “creator liason,” &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kxOuG8jMIgI"&gt;announced the removal of dislikes&lt;/a&gt; to infamous footage of US soldier Jeremiah Denton, who was captured during the Vietnam War. In 1966, Denton was forced to give a television interview by his captors, during which he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/03/29/296211985/j-denton-fo"&gt;blinked in Morse code&lt;/a&gt; to spell out the word “torture.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CHB4C"&gt;You can read Karim’s latest update in full below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="description"&gt;The spoken words did not match the eyes. The video reminded me of an interview Admiral Jeremiah Denton gave in 1966. I have never seen a less enthusiastic, more reluctant announcement of something that is supposed to be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4enGm"&gt;Calling the removal of dislikes a good thing for creators cannot be done without conflict by someone holding the title of “YouTube’s Creator Liaison”. We know this because there exists not a single YouTube Creator who thinks removing dislikes is a good idea — for YouTube or for Creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg5Gmb"&gt;Why would YouTube make this universally disliked change? There is a reason, but it’s not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed. Instead, there will be references to various studies. Studies that apparently contradict the common sense of every YouTuber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDLu0l"&gt;The ability to easily and quickly identify bad content is an essential feature of a user-generated content platform. Why? Because not all user-generated content is good. It can’t be. In fact, most of it is not good. And that’s OK. The idea was never that all content is good. The idea WAS, however, that among the flood of content, there are great creations waiting to be exposed. And for that to happen, the stuff that’s not great has to fall by the side as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrdchD"&gt;The process works, and there’s a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it. Then, the platform invariably declines. Does YouTube want to become a place where everything is mediocre? Because nothing can be great if nothing is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV3HaD"&gt;In business, there’s only one thing more important than “Make it better”. And that’s “Don’t fuck it up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
