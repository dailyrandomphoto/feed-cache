    <title>Apple introduces Siri for third-party devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Na6kHEQOPltkp6vsxMt9OfrGW3A=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418452/lcimg_bdd5a604_baa2_4518_a03e_bf828a525d3e.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfREqO"&gt;Siri is finally coming to third-party devices. Apple announced at its WWDC keynote that HomeKit accessory makers will be able to integrate Siri voice control into their devices later this year. The voice assistant will be routed through a HomePod if the devices are connected to your network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EfaW1"&gt;Apple hasn’t released a comprehensive list of devices and brands that will support Siri. The company demoed it on an Ecobee thermostat during its WWDC keynote presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugvo3D"&gt;Apple also announced a number of new smart home features. Home Keys, which allow you to remotely lock and unlock doors, are now supported in the Wallet app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhKPJss_w0FcLUjIVE1pszuMgUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643338/lcimg_2686e85d_8036_43f4_bd45_102917d9f1c2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BAAvmp"&gt;The HomePod Mini will support lossless audio in Apple Music later this year and will be able to function as a TV speaker, like you can currently do with the discontinued full-size HomePod. HomePods also now support commands for the Apple TV, and SharePlay now works with Apple TV. Speaking of Apple TV, it now supports the “Shared with You” feature, which allows users to share TV shows via tvOS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkWn7cWwSc3qWXVf4CNQAmRoYqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643337/lcimg_7879a186_9bec_434c_a7bf_b805150a6a95.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kOqvv3"&gt;And the Apple Watch now supports the HomePod’s intercom feature, which will allow you to talk to compatible video doorbells and access package detection from your wrist. You’ll be able to control nearby HomeKit accessories in camera view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkypad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWDC 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple lets users see family members’ Health data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5CY5t2zUbaXFVslJ_h3STUGkC0=/5x256:806x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418399/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvtRRE"&gt;Apple will let people share the data from their Health app with family members or others, the company announced. It’s one of a new slate of heath features for iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPLlL9"&gt;With permission, someone can share access to their overall heart rate and movement data. They’ll also be able to share access to alerts like a high heart rate or change in mobility. The person they’re sharing the data with can message them directly about any changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY2NwH"&gt;Apple is also adding another health metric, called walking steadiness, to the Health app. It will use mobility data already collected by the iPhone to monitor for any changes to factors like balance or walking patterns, and will tell users if they’re at an increased risk of falling. The app will also include some exercises to help increase steadiness. The company says it built the system using data collected through a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; that included over 100,000 participants at all ages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmsLCz"&gt;Users will now also be able to share their Health app data with their doctors. Physicians already regularly have patients &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;bringing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463322/wearables-afib-apple-fitbit-doctor-visit"&gt;readouts&lt;/a&gt; from their devices into appointments. The integration will let people transfer that data more directly. Apple said the feature will start off with support from six electronic medical record companies in the United States, including Cerner and Athenahealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lShY3C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWDC 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey lets you run Shortcuts and share input and files between Macs and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbbg3kwo6UfUluS7bo1ST7-BCvM=/5x0:1564x1039/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418342/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cSXpW2"&gt;Apple has announced the next version of macOS at its WWDC keynote, after showing off iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8Ih2W"&gt;The company is promising even more interoperability with iOS, including the ability to share a keyboard and mouse between a Mac and an iPad. The feature is similar to the one found on Logitech keyboards and mice, letting you seemingly move your cursor and files between a Mac and iPad. Macs are also getting the ability to act as an AirPlay target, allowing you to use your Mac’s screen and sound to play content from your iPhone and iPad (or even other Macs if you’re feeling spicy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shoSvl"&gt;Apple has also announced that Macs would be getting its Shortcuts automation application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCx6Qj"&gt;In addition, Safari is getting a bit of a redesign, with tab groups and a cleaner toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3CqAvW5vjfWXinHsdR749MBUdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643340/image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the new Safari interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NbR5di"&gt;This is the first version of macOS that’s being announced after the rise of Apple’s M1-powered Macs, the first of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21552828/apple-macbook-air-arm-m1-chip-laptop-specs-price-release-date"&gt;was announced in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s plan is to have its entire line switch over to its custom chips by the end of next year, so it seems that macOS Monterey will be the operating system shepherding Macs through much of the rest of the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eB965P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWDC 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces watchOS 8 with new health features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdhKXMz81ZBxPVMiDspBUy5xYk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418263/vpavic_120916__1220_0325_close.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnGUo5"&gt;Apple has just announced watchOS 8, the latest version of the company’s smartwatch platform for the Apple Watch. The new software succeeds last year’s watchOS 7 and is going to be first available for developers to test their apps with starting today, with a public beta coming in July. A final public release is expected later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBSX64"&gt;Apple is debuting a new Mindfulness app, an extension of the Breathe app that nags you to breathe throughout the day. It’s adding new animations and other features to help you relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLsMth"&gt;The Fitness app is getting more workout types for tai chi and pilates. The Apple Watch’s Health app will explicitly track your respiratory rate and notify you if it’s outside of your normal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2lmPaKpOvaosbL-2QI91CztGnTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643274/lcimg_e0eb6a55_c77c_4513_86a9_1373f1fd5bb0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Portrait watch face is coming in watchOS 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lgd1Sj"&gt;There’s a new watchface that will let you use a photo taken with the iPhone’s portrait mode and layer text and other information behind it. Apple says you will be able to customize what text is shown and how it integrates with the image itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3op1o"&gt;Similarly, the Photos app on the watch is getting upgraded with a new layout and the ability to share photos directly through Messages or Apple’s Mail app. There are new text entry options when replying to messages. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfdVWLoOXSu2H8CfebLsVTOgAMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643282/lcimg_13fd8fbd_fc86_4ecd_bfd1_7d9df4b29e09.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The suite of new features coming in watchOS 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WGGVYm"&gt;WatchOS 8 will be gaining some of the new features coming in iOS 15, including the new focus mode that lets you choose apps or contacts to push notifications to you in specific contexts. There are a handful of other new features coming too, including next-hour precipitation alerts. Apple says that the Series 6 watch will get support for car key support, utilizing its UWB radio. You’ll also be able to use your watch to find other Apple devices, such as AirTags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQiaPx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWDC 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple adds welcome privacy features to Mail, Safari</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eqpTNvKXHPluqTh87_h-ccAycoM=/99x0:1140x694/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418247/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6NgMr4"&gt;Apple has always stressed user privacy as part of its core mission. At its WWDC 2021 event, it announced it would be adding a spate of powerful new functions to Mail and Safari, as well as giving users broader insight into what their installed apps are doing with their information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY8N9Y"&gt;First, Apple’s Mail appears to have declared war on tracking pixels, which can be included in some emails to give third parties insight into if or when their messages have been opened — though it didn’t provide much detail on how it will win said war. Mail will also, according to Apple’s manager of user privacy software Katie Skinner, now hide user IP addresses by default. Safari, likewise, will hide IPs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjyDso"&gt;More surprisingly, Apple announced it’s adding an App Privacy Report, which will live in settings and provide an overview of, as you might have guessed, privacy-related matters as they related to installed apps. For example: how often apps use your contacts, microphone, location, or other data and identifiers. The App Privacy Report will also show which third-party domains are receiving your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NSkhx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWDC 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iCloud Plus bundles a VPN, private email, and HomeKit camera storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A promo image showing the logo of iCloud Plus." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bLa9GHinmTSBll7xopCL1PzMms8=/17x0:1682x1110/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418241/lcimg_49079014_177d_4b21_a9d0_f8e66c52c9a3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WuFNaz"&gt;Apple is amping up iCloud with a new set of features called iCloud Plus. The cloud storage service will now come with access to a VPN, burner email addresses, and unlimited storage for HomeKit-enabled home security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng1oBX"&gt;The VPN, called Private Relay, will route your internet traffic through two relays in order to mask who’s browsing and where that data is coming from. The burner email feature, called Hide My Email, lets you create single-use email addresses that will forward to your actual account; that way, you can provide a junk email to a service you don’t trust in case it starts spamming you. Apple already offers a similar feature through Sign In With Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOfF98"&gt;Apple will also include unlimited storage for video from HomeKit-enabled home security cameras. You currently need to pay for at least 200GB of iCloud storage to record video from one camera, and you need to pay for a higher tier to support more streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNFqoz"&gt;The features are all supposed to be included with existing iCloud plans at no additional cost. Apple didn’t say if the feature would be available through its cheapest plans, though, which don’t currently support HomeKit video storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A laptop with the Digital Legacy screen pulled up. The page explains how to access data from another person’s account, saying that you need an access key. A smartphone has a screen pulled up saying “Request access” and that you will need to provide a copy of a death certificate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jDAQ4Q3qs9PM__wWn7lT2ThR_N4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643272/lcimg_3f636f4a_b117_4181_b27e_f468b53a991d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s Digital Legacy feature for iCloud.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2uymdJ"&gt;Apple is also introducing new features to help manage your iCloud account. There’s a new recovery feature that allows Apple to message security codes to your friends or family if your own device is lost. There’s also a “Digital Legacy” program that lets you choose who can access your files after you die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeEYJB"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple didn’t announce the iCloud update we were all hoping for: a free storage tier that starts above a paltry 5GB. Maybe next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Siri will finally work without an internet connection with on-device speech recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KK8VisBxpuvt5CYcB2Ws-Sue0E8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418233/acastro_180510_1777_siri_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9Cvuf"&gt;Apple’s digital assistant Siri will process audio on-device by default in iOS 15, meaning you will be able to use the feature without an active internet connection. Apple says the upgrade will also make Siri faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6WPQc"&gt;Processing audio on-device will make using Siri more private, says Apple. This follows the company’s well-established preference for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/13/16300464/apple-iphone-x-ai-neural-engine"&gt;implementing machine learning features on-device&lt;/a&gt;, rather than sending data away to the cloud to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0a4j3"&gt;“This addresses the biggest privacy concern we hear from voice assistants, which is unwanted audio recording,” said an Apple presenter during WWDC. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wDXszcZQ4p_NGzdxDXUPgCirGeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643259/lcimg_726e790c_0eb7_46e8_8432_cb17f64818eb.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vFORhs"&gt;Obviously, if you don’t have an internet connection then you won’t be able to carry out certain Siri functions like &lt;em&gt;searching the web&lt;/em&gt;. But you can use Apple’s digital assistant for simple navigational tasks, like controlling your music, opening apps, adjusting settings and so on. Making these functions accessible offline is a great move for accessibility, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is making AirPods easier to hear with and find</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pSYfrFbbC6ou2fLLS_00fXB5Syo=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418106/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZ65dj"&gt;Apple has announced that AirPods will be getting some quality-of-life improvements with iOS 15, including the ability to boost the sound of people talking to you, better Find My support, and the ability to announce a wider range of notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRWshn"&gt;Apple says the “Conversation Boost” feature will help people who have difficulties hearing other people’s voices when they’re talking. It will try to isolate the voice of the person in front of you, with sliders that let the user control how much ambient noise is let in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SeTP8CmJLKGREDhm1XHtUPSgok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643172/image.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hs690I"&gt;AirPods can already announce messages and texts, but now they’re getting the ability to read out other important notifications, like when a food delivery is made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svmuIk"&gt;The easy-to-lose headphones are also getting more Find My abilities, including an AirTag-like proximity view that tells you how far away your buds are. Using the same tech, your phone will also be able to alert you if you’re about to leave your AirPods behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RY6LE"&gt;AirPods will, of course, support the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;spatial audio in FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; feature announced earlier in the show, as well as spatial audio on Macs and Apple TVs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll soon be able to use your iPhone as ID at the airport </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5F16ta"&gt;Apple has announced a forthcoming update to its Wallet app that will allow you to use your iPhone as digital identification in US airports. The company showed how you’ll be able to scan your driver’s license or state ID in participating US states, which will then be encrypted and stored in the iPhone’s secure enclave. The company says it’s working with the TSA to enable the iPhone to be used as identification at airport security checkpoints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zW2bsG"&gt;As well as secure ID, Apple says it’s working to allow hotels to distribute room card keys via Apple Wallet, allowing you to collect a room key before you arrive at a hotel. Home keys and work keys were also announced as coming to the Wallet app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ID cards can be brought into Apple Wallet by scanning them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IdVfxP"&gt;Apple Wallet launched with support for card purchases before expanding to cover other use cases like transit passes. Apple reiterated that it’s also adding features for unlocking cars using recent iPhones’ ultra-wideband support with BMW and other car manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces iPadOS 15 with homescreen and multitasking improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QC65DFvSMlddSn8fgPa76KdVy2k=/81x0:2136x1370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418064/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.39.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Widgets can be placed anywhere on the home screen in iPadOS 15.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0W3pe4"&gt;Weeks after introducing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;most powerful iPad Pro devices ever&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is today announcing the latest version of iPadOS — and there’s a clear focus on making Apple’s tablets more capable productivity machines. At least if you find yourself using split-screen mode a lot, that is. Otherwise, there aren’t any radical changes for the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWsVrl"&gt;As rumored, iPadOS 15 will make the homescreen more customizable and allow for more flexible placement of widgets. You can now stick them anywhere you’d like, a capability that came to iOS 14 last year. But iPadOS 14 didn’t offer the same functionality, and widgets could only be placed in the Today View sidebar despite the tablet’s vast screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uasWDl"&gt;Apple is also bringing the App Library to iPadOS. Much like on the iPhone, it will let you maintain a less-cluttered homescreen by filing away the apps you rarely use to an automatically organized section of folders. On iPads, the App Library is located in the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzQCA1"&gt;Multitasking is also getting some much-needed refinement. New icons will make it simpler to go into split-view mode, and Apple also mentioned a “shelf” feature that makes it easier to jumble different tasks. It’s a significant change to how multitasking currently works on iPadOS, and it seems like a major improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Msw5NFDQVFvpg60vzONxAhdDZqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643174/766_2021_06_07_766_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking is getting more intuitive in iPadOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E7TfDu"&gt;QuickNote is a new convenience that will let you attach notes to webpages and other areas of iPadOS, making them easier to get back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cJlia"&gt;Finally, the standalone Translate app is also now coming to iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z7c2ag"&gt;New tricks shared with iOS 15 on the iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ISTSKp"&gt;iPadOS 15 will also share many of the new features and experiences that are coming to iOS 15. FaceTime calls will now support spatial audio for more lifelike, natural sound. A voice isolation feature will let your voice cut through background noise, and a “wide spectrum” option will pick up &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; sound than before. Portrait mode is also coming to FaceTime, resulting in a blurred background that keeps the focus on your face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgrlvA"&gt;Apple is introducing a new SharePlay feature for FaceTime that allows people to share media — music, movies, etc. — together on a group call. SharePlay will leverage iOS features like picture-in-picture, iMessage, and more for a seamless experience across multiple devices at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIQACb"&gt;The new iPad software update includes new tools meant to help you focus, like revamped notifications that are easier to identify and a “notification summary” section that recaps your less-than-essential notifications. You can also customize which notifications you’ll see at different points of the day, allowing you to separate work and personal alerts. Focus preferences are synced across Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNk9EY"&gt;Memories in the Photos app can now synced up with music tracks with automatic filters and effects applied based on the vibe of the song, and Spotlight search is also getting some deeper search capabilities. Live Text is a feature that uses on-device intelligence to let you select text from photos you’ve taken and those in your camera roll. It supports seven languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uIJi6p"&gt;Apple punts for another year on “pro” requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xO4nWu"&gt;The M1-powered iPad Pros are on equal footing with Apple’s latest iMac, MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini in terms of sheer performance. Their release has only fueled calls for Apple to evolve iPadOS into a platform that can properly take advantage of all that power for those trying to use the devices as laptop replacements. Using an iPad is a fantastic experience that can regularly turn frustrating when you run into its software limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUFo5S"&gt;On the pre-WWDC wishlist of some users were things like multi-user support, a more advanced Files app, better support for external displays, and pro-caliber apps like Final Cut and Logic making their way to the iPad. Apple didn’t address many of those wants in today’s keynote. The most “pro” capability announced was the ability to create and ship apps using Swift Playgrounds. So we’ll have to see what other improvements and surprises iPadOS 15 may hold as it enters beta in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3HW6O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22229968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWDC 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
