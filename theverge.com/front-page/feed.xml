    <title>Genie Plus lets you skip lines at Disney World, but fans aren’t happy about it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BIZ-DISNEY-50TH-CELEBRATION-2-OS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nR9iyFi9klPfHlFGtbzsNilB9lQ=/0x79:3000x2079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69995047/1235633497.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fq0zd8"&gt;Walt Disney World is offering yet another way to make your experience more magical (or more miserable, depending on how you look at it). Set to launch on October 19th, Disney’s Genie service will grant you a number of wishes, including the ability to skip lines — once you pay up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disney Genie app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O8ADKjara2liRuo66PQ-6ADUQVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926907/disney_genie_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SzwSK9"&gt;Disney first introduced the service in an August &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, noting that you’ll be able to access the Disney Genie service through the My Disney Experience and Disneyland apps. The Disney Genie will serve as your personal trip planner and, if you choose the paid option, will let you jump to the front of your favorite rides’ lines via the Lightning Lane entrances. The only caveat is that you can only choose one ride at a time. While this sounds like a handy service to have, it’s the added cost for the Genie Plus that Disney goers aren’t happy about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BDwlQe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disney Genie Plus is a paid replacement for the old, free FastPass system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FpZJdd"&gt;Both the free and paid versions of the Genie service provide tailored recommendations for dining options, events, and attractions. Simply tell the service what you want to do at Disney, and it will give you personalized results. It also gives you information on how long the wait may be for certain attractions, as well as provides scheduling suggestions to help you beat the crowds. When you start to solidify your plans, you can use the service to browse through your daily schedule, which might include reservations for restaurants, hotels, and specific events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rm1CSH"&gt;If you only want to use the above features, the Genie will prove to be convenient and very useful. The line-skipping perk, however, comes with a price that some might not be willing to pay. The paid Disney Genie Plus service will cost $15 per ticket per day at Walt Disney World, and $20 per ticket per day at Disneyland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJY5RU"&gt;And if you don’t want to use Disney Genie Plus at all, you’ll have to purchase Lightning Lane passes for a very limited selection of individual rides. To make matters even more confusing, those individual rides aren’t even included with Genie Plus. This means you’ll be stuck paying another fee in addition to Genie Plus if you want to experience attractions like Space Mountain or Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iErUBO"&gt;Disney guests clearly aren’t happy about the change — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fP50klEPE"&gt;Disney’s announcement video&lt;/a&gt; for the Genie service has a telling 12,000 dislikes compared to 956 likes. The outrage mainly comes from the fact that the FastPass and FastPass Plus, Disney’s line-skipping services that will be imminently phased out, were free to use. Although you didn’t have much control over the specifics of your ride schedule, it still helped you avoid standing in a queue for hours, free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNtF71"&gt;Right now, the only benefit to the Disney Genie Plus service is that it’s supposed to give you a better chance of getting on the more popular rides. Even still, adding the cost of the Genie Plus service on top of pricey tickets, hotel stays, and restaurants visits isn’t really fair to guests. Who knows, if people aren’t satisfied with their Disney Genie experience, maybe we’ll see more people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679895/florida-man-hollywood-studios-skips-lines-disney-employee-ipad-app"&gt;hijacking employees’ iPads so they can skip lines using some of their own magic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo’s autonomous vehicles keep getting stuck in a dead-end street in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Waymo Self Driving Car" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjujG2y3w-BUkvV5-fPMpLmk6IM=/0x2:5195x3465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994905/1324922564.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HovVJ4"&gt;Traffic is hell, but what if the cars clogging up the roadways are all robots? That’s what some residents on one quiet street in San Francisco have discovered, with a seemingly endless parade of autonomous vehicles from Waymo driving down a dead-end street in the city’s residential Richmond district, turning around, and driving away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrvh2Y"&gt;“There are some days where it can be up to 50,” resident Jennifer King told &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/10/14/dead-end-sf-street-plagued-with-confused-waymo-cars-trying-to-turn-around-every-5-minutes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KPIX 5 &lt;/em&gt;in this hilarious scene report&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s literally every five minutes. And we’re all working from home, so this is what we hear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zh2dtg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are some days where it can be up to 50”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KDKJ3w"&gt;Residents are confused as to why the Waymo vehicles — Jaguar I-Pace SUVs with rooftop sensors and high-tech compute systems inside — keep coming, one after the other, sometimes two or three at a time. They aren’t picking up or dropping off customers, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639226/waymo-san-francisco-rides-self-driving-service"&gt;Waymo recently announcing&lt;/a&gt; that it was going to start shuttling passengers around San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ozRI7S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A normally quiet neighborhood in San Francisco is buzzing about a sudden explosion of traffic. Neighbors say their Richmond District dead-end street has suddenly become crowded with WayMo vehicles. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rD0iXmmL29"&gt;https://t.co/rD0iXmmL29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— KPIX 5 (@KPIXtv) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KPIXtv/status/1448320899137081347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i2q8Zt"&gt;They don’t have any explanation for the odd behavior. (Waymo didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;KPIX 5 &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;requests for an explanation.) As someone who covers the AV industry, I could speculate about the need for companies to train their vehicle’s artificial intelligence software in all the elements of human driving, including messy maneuvers like the dreaded three-point turn. But I’m really just having too much fun watching these confused robot cars pile into this dead-end street over and over again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxdYrl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436584/waymo-driverless-stuck-traffic-roadside-assistance-video"&gt;It called to mind a recent event in Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, in which a fully driverless Waymo vehicle got stuck at an intersection and then, when an extraction crew showed up, tried to run away before completely blocking a three-lane highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aydzNj"&gt;The obvious difference is that Waymo is still using safety drivers for its tests in San Francisco. In the video, you can see Waymo’s safety drivers turning the steering wheels, which suggests that the vehicles haven’t quite mastered the turn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bybIqy"&gt;The incident is garnering some unwanted attention, including from one guy who runs a car company that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota"&gt;under investigation for numerous crashes involving stopped emergency vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;really shouldn’t be gloating about things like this. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SMRbV4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="tl" dir="ltr"&gt;Haha&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1448681402917138442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iek7N4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nanoleaf’s latest smart lights are more nightclub than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6ll8DjvA728MqIz9GcVhVbt4yo=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994776/Lines_36x_Entertainment_Room_AngledWall_4000x2250px__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Lines is the latest product from the smart lighting company.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pmkTB0"&gt;First, there were triangles; then there were squares. Next came hexagons, and now, say hello to lines. No, this isn't your sixth grader’s geometry homework. It’s the latest addition to smart lighting maker Nanoleaf’s ever-growing catalog of modular LED light panels. The new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fnanoleaf-lines%2F%3Futm_source%3DGeneral%26utm_medium%3Dlinesnanoleaf%26utm_campaign%3Dlinesnanoleaf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22725220%2Fnanoleaf-lines-modular-smart-lighting-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nanoleaf Lines&lt;/a&gt; are ultra-lightweight, color-changing lights in a bar shape. Backlit, they connect at 60-degree angles to create geometric designs of your choosing, and with dual-color zones, the Lines ($199.99) can add a visual feast to any wall or ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSS0GO"&gt;As with Nanoleaf’s Shapes, Canvas, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Elements wall panels&lt;/a&gt;, Lines can be installed using pre-affixed, double-sided tape, making it an easy setup — although you’ll want to plan your design before committing. Powered by a large plug with a 14.7 foot cable, each Line emits 20 lumens, has a color temperature range of 1200K to 6500K, and can display more than 16 million colors. You can link up to 18 Lines per power supply, and control them with the Nanoleaf app, an on-device remote, or voice control using a compatible voice assistant. The Lines only work with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi networks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jC1e9F72O_wUHs8WLv53Q59j0Ws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926324/Lines_66x_CeilingMounted_4000x2250px.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Lines are modular light panels that can be mounted on the wall or ceiling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GzhVfs"&gt;Nanoleaf provides 19 pre-set dynamic RGBW lighting scenes (meaning they shift colors) in the app, or you can create your own to add ambiance to a home theater or enhance your favorite chill-out space. The Lines also work with Nanoleaf’s music visualization technology to sync with songs in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZrFH6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nanoleaf’s entire smart lighting line is compatible with Apple HomeKit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIna6y"&gt;Unlike the recent Elements panels, which are suited to more traditional home decor, the Lines have a very futuristic vibe, and honestly seem tailor-made for YouTuber backgrounds. The backlit look is also a departure from the other shapes, which project light outwards, not back toward the wall. This product line also seems designed with the gamer in mind; especially as the Lines integrates with Nanoleaf’s screen mirror feature to sync your lights with on-screen colors and animations. This requires the Nanoleaf desktop app, but can also work with a TV using an HDMI connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt9209"&gt;Nanoleaf’s entire smart lighting line is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT, allowing you to control, dim, and change designs with voice commands or through a smart home routine. Plus, as with its current lighting panels, Nanoleaf’s Lines can act as a Thread border router to connect its Essentials line of bulbs and light strips to your network without a third-party hub. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4tgaIfev0vQ5Ep6nvwxPBKrC3OY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926333/Lines_9x_Option_2_Bedroom_desk_4000x2250.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screen mirror feature can sync the colors in Nanoleaf Lines to your computer screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D9tjBz"&gt;Eventually, Nanoleaf says any Thread-enabled device will connect to a Thread network using a Nanoleaf border router. Thread is a key technology in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to unite smart home devices and platforms and allow for more interoperability. Nanoleaf says Lines have been designed with “Matter in mind” and will work with the new standard via a software update next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQcYc7"&gt;Nanoleaf Lines is available for pre-order on October 14th from &lt;a href="http://go.nanoleaf.me"&gt;Nanoleaf’s website&lt;/a&gt; and Best Buy. Smarter Kits (9 Lines) are $199.99, and Expansion Packs (3 Lines) are $79.99. Black and pink skins to customize the look of the front of the Lines, and flex connectors to bed around corners are coming later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawmakers want to strip legal protections from the Facebook News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Whistleblower Frances Haugen Testifies Before Senate Commerce Subcommittee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQTVEv39d3J8fS3RWW8-y9j9j1M=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994746/1235715609.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oeolxy"&gt;Democratic lawmakers want social networks to face legal liability if they recommend harmful content to users. Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), Mike Doyle (D-PA), and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) introduced the “Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act,” which would amend Section 230’s protections to exclude “personalized recommendations” for content that contributes to physical or severe emotional injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXEBId"&gt;The bill follows a recommendation Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/algorithms-shouldnt-be-protected-by-section-230-facebook-whistleblower-tells-senate/"&gt;made before Congress last week&lt;/a&gt;. Haugen, a former employee who leaked extensive internal Facebook research, encouraged lawmakers to crack down on algorithms that promote, rank, or otherwise order content based on user engagement. It applies to web services with over 5 million monthly visitors and excludes certain categories of material, including infrastructure services like web hosting and systems that return search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sK89d8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill doesn’t apply to very small services or search rankings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D5XYjE"&gt;For platforms that are covered, the bill targets Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which prevents people from suing web services over third-party content that users post. The new exception would let these cases proceed if the services knowingly or recklessly used a “personalized algorithm” to recommend the third-party content in question. That could include posts, groups, accounts, and other user-provided info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIEoX3"&gt;The bill wouldn’t necessarily let people sue over the kinds of material Haugen criticized, which include hate speech and anorexia-related content. Much of that material is legal in the United States, so platforms don’t need an additional liability shield for hosting it. (A Pallone statement &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/14/top-democrats-unveil-bill-rein-tech-companies-malicious-algorithms"&gt;also castigated sites&lt;/a&gt; for promoting “extremism” and “disinformation,” which aren’t necessarily illegal either.) The bill also only covers &lt;em&gt;personalized&lt;/em&gt; recommendations, defined as sorting content with an algorithm that “relies on information specific to an individual.” Companies could seemingly still use large-scale analytics to recommend the most popular general content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlIUqF"&gt;In her testimony, Haugen suggested that the goal was to add general legal risk until Facebook and similar companies stopped using personalized recommendations altogether. “If we reformed [Section] 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intentional ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement-based ranking,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose headphones and Apple iPhone accessories are on sale today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bose QuietComfort 35" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFa9sV6MwJK-8ixh2-6yCYbBbYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994166/theverge10_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The popular Bose QC35 II headphones are just one of many great deals today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c8qrAq"&gt;There are many great deals to be had today, especially if you enjoy a variety of options to browse and online window-shop. Amazon’s highlighted daily sale, currently coined as Epic Daily Deals, has several Bose headphones and earbuds discounted. There is a little bit for everyone here, ranging from the popular mainstay QuietComfort 35 II Bluetooth headphones and its gaming-accessorized counterpart to noise-canceling and sport-focused earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vS7NSQ"&gt;First, let’s dive into the QC35 II. These noise-canceling headphones became the industry standard for folks wanting comfortable and lightweight everyday headphones, especially for commuting and traveling on planes where the ANC can be most effective. There is a new model that just came out, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;Bose QC45&lt;/a&gt;, so the QC35 II may be phased out at some point, but the time is ripe for discounts. Amazon’s daily deal price on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the QC35 II for today is $249&lt;/a&gt;, saving $50 off its usual $300 price and a full $80 cheaper than the brand new model that succeeds it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wVotej"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLKakm"&gt;If you want to keep using your commuter headphones once you’re home, you can also score the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DVCNYJC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QC35 II in its gaming-adorned load-out for just $279&lt;/a&gt; — that same $50 discount. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439699/bose-quiet-comfort-35-ii-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-pc-bluetooth-price"&gt;QuietComfort 35 II Gaming Headset is the same set of cans&lt;/a&gt; but with an attachable mic boom and USB controller for volume and monitoring adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tsOSMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFypL"&gt;If you’re not the full-size headphones type and prefer the convenience of earbuds or the flexibility of open-ear listening, there are even more options today. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sit at the top of these offerings, with active noise canceling that bests the AirPods Pro and takes the crown as the ANC champ. Just be aware that the bulky case makes these larger earbuds a bit less convenient to tote around. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Noise-Cancelling-Earbuds/dp/B08C4KWM9T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s sale price of $199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is the best price to date on these earbuds that launched at the tail end of 2020, with a significant savings of $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PoINHk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="G6U4Gf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HlVxM1"&gt;Capping off all these Bose sales at Amazon today, here is a lightning round of earbuds and open-ear options to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2DbRnW"&gt;The smaller, workout-focused Bose Sport Earbuds are IPX4 sweat and weather resistant and down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sport-Earbuds-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B08CJCTG6Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149 — a savings of $30&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zO6sdL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215281/base-sport-open-earbuds-ambient-noise-workout"&gt;Bose Sport Open Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; also offer the same environmental resistance without blocking your ear canal, keeping you aware of the general space around you. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sport-Open-Earbuds-Headphones/dp/B08VRLZGMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s price of $179 saves $20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5kT7IG"&gt;For a more stylish take on open-ear Bluetooth wireless listening, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Frames-Audio-Sunglasses-Black/dp/B07P7VVCDD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Frames Alto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Frames-Tempo-Sunglasses-Connectivity/dp/B08CZL53F3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Frames Tempo&lt;/a&gt; are discounted by $24 and $25, respectively. The Alto is the more fashion-focused everyday wear version, while the Tempo is better suited for an active lifestyle like cycling or running. Both keep your ears unblocked to keep you better in tune with your surroundings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The $499 HTC Vive Flow is VR for people who don’t like VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rlMtg6aNshLqJE1H4W9Rbo9axKs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994113/akrales_211005_4774_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;HTC wants to find a new VR market — but what is it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3k75EG"&gt;After years of focusing on business-oriented virtual reality, HTC is launching a $499 entertainment-focused headset called the Vive Flow in November, with preorders starting globally today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px43Xw"&gt;The new Vive Flow looks radically different from most HTC Vive devices. It’s a standalone piece of hardware modeled after a pair of sunglasses, and at first glance it could pass for an &lt;em&gt;augmented&lt;/em&gt; reality headset, not just a VR one. But behind those slightly bug-eyed mirror shades, you’ll find a lighter version of earlier Vive headsets — minus some major features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssvVAYZB2p5r_er-wSMldIKiKZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908700/akrales_211005_4774_0376.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vive Flow features focus dials on the inside of the headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Pe4G"&gt;The Vive Flow, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721337/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-vivport-verse-metaverse"&gt;leaked heavily&lt;/a&gt; before HTC’s reveal today, is a compromise between capability and approachability. The device has a 1.6K-per-eye display (HTC didn’t provide the exact resolution) with a 100-degree field of view at a 75Hz refresh rate. That’s a little more limited than the 120 degrees and 90Hz rate that you’ll find on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588917/htc-vive-focus-3-vr-headset-review"&gt;the more costly Vive Focus 3&lt;/a&gt; and roughly the same refresh rate but a lower field of view than the original Quest. It’s also slightly comparable to the Oculus Quest’s refresh rate before a recent upgrade and a little more cramped than its 110-degree field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S33DQB"&gt;Two front-facing cameras handle inside-out motion tracking, and HTC plans to support hand tracking as well, although the feature wasn’t available during a pre-launch demo and didn’t give an exact timeline for its rollout. It’s using the last-generation Qualcomm XR1 chipset (as opposed to the Quest 2’s XR2), and it’s got a respectable 64GB of storage space but — unlike the Focus 3 — no slot for an expansion card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpr4Du"&gt;Lightweight hardware is a big selling point for HTC. “We wanted to get to something lighter, more wearable, easier to travel with,” says Dan O’Brien, HTC’s head of VR. The Flow weighs 189 grams, compared to around 500 grams for the Oculus Quest 2, and has a hinged design that folds up to fit in a $49 carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6YmYLkj-8Iq2cieaGsGcbZn5uU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908694/akrales_211005_4774_0177.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lzT2mc"&gt;Unlike earlier Vive headsets, the Vive Flow won’t come with a controller. Instead, you connect the headset wirelessly to an Android smartphone and use the phone as a combination remote / touchpad. Similar to the mobile Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR remotes, it’s basically a virtual laser pointer with buttons for selecting items and calling up the homescreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vGX0j"&gt;Leaked photos showed the Flow plugged into a black box, which some people speculated might be an external computing device. It’s actually a $79 battery pack that should let you use the headset for four to five hours. The Flow technically has its own battery, but HTC says it only lasts a few minutes — it’s designed to let you swap power sources without turning off the headset. So you’ll need either the HTC battery, which is sold separately from the headset, or (according to HTC) any 10,000mAh power bank and a USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5McNzYw9hbRfK9ATk-Q5NJaITU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908698/akrales_211005_4774_0416.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxbJ23"&gt;In addition to controlling the device, the phone connection lets you mirror Android apps, calling up a virtual copy of your phone’s homescreen and letting you launch apps like streaming video services in a floating window. The headset doesn’t pair with iPhones, and while HTC hasn’t ruled out future support, it indicated there were serious barriers to making iOS play well with the Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SMTg7"&gt;HTC wants people to use the Vive Flow for visually immersive but mostly stationary experiences. So you can watch a 360-degree video or sit in a virtual environment, but you can’t use apps that require full-fledged virtual hands. (This rules out most well-known VR games.) The camera tracking gives you a more natural experience than a headset that can only detect the angle of your head, but the app catalog and the somewhat loose-fitting glasses-style design mean you probably won’t be walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7sC8p"&gt;HTC says the Flow will launch with 100 apps and support 150 by the end of the year. In addition to uses like streaming video, its release announcement promotes the Tripp meditation app and the VR therapeutic service MyndVR, which is tailored for older adults. You can also engage with VR social spaces like Vive Sync and watch streaming video, something that’s proven &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22700782/nreal-air-smart-ar-glasses-release-date-shipping-countries"&gt;popular on AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;. The Flow will support a limited subset of the apps on HTC’s Viveport store, and users can subscribe to a discounted, Flow-focused $5.99-per-month version of Viveport’s app subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGz8Ry"&gt;The Vive Flow seems basically pitched as a VR headset for people who find current VR headsets overcomplicated or intimidating. O’Brien describes the device as something that’s easy to put in a bag while traveling without worrying about extra pieces like controllers. “We wanted to make something that was super easy and flexible,” he says. Instead of directly competing with gaming-oriented headsets, HTC is trying to carve out a new category of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVU23f"&gt;HTC’s focus on older users (“the huge Boomer population,” as a MyndVR representative put it) is part of this strategy. So is the push for a glasses-like design instead of the straps you’ll find on most headsets. “There’s the user that really just wants this thing to be un-intimidating and easy to pop on and off,” O’Brien says — and that’s who the Flow is made for. The result has a lot in common with the now-discontinued Oculus Go, but with a svelter look and upgrades like the inside-out camera tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wlTPTDFi72KIwoa_nAtqX23_sRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908697/akrales_211005_4774_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a1SZAuNt51nupsEA-v40rkX1wWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908695/akrales_211005_4774_0043.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIh0gg"&gt;My brief experience with the Vive Flow was a mixed bag. The Flow is, in fact, remarkably light — presumably in part because HTC offloaded its battery. But without a strap system to keep the headset in place, the screen kept slipping down my face and blurring the top half of my VR experience. HTC plans to offer alternate swappable face gaskets for different fits, and one of them worked better than the original. But I still had to be careful while turning my head, and the feeling of carefully balancing the headset wasn’t exactly relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbPJBe"&gt;The Flow was exponentially more bearable than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/10/12405354/dlodlo-v1-virtual-reality-headset-sunglasses"&gt;earlier “glasses-style” VR headsets&lt;/a&gt; I’ve tried. It’s just still a lot more unsteady-feeling than the Focus 3, Quest, or practically any other major headset, and there’s no alternate strap option for people who want a more secure fit. There’s a diopter adjustment dial so you can change the focus on each eye individually, but like the Quest 2, you inconveniently can’t change the focus while you’re actually looking at an image — you have to take the headset off, twist the wheels a notch, and then put it back on again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L99GL"&gt;The smartphone-based controller, the Vive Flow’s biggest departure from standard VR design, is theoretically reasonable but practically awkward. I used an HTC-provided Android device that worked fine as a VR laser pointer. But thanks to the long-running trend of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus"&gt;ever-bigger phones&lt;/a&gt;, I could barely fit my hand around HTC’s phone to tap virtual buttons on the screen. It’s also a strange choice for any headset aimed at older users, who are &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/"&gt;dramatically less likely&lt;/a&gt; to own smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Flow headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJlOfH0HqmI8pXjaQDT6Jw2Ml6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908699/akrales_211005_4774_0296.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A soft, swappable gasket sits between your face and the lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IgtrFT"&gt;Hand tracking could partly solve the interaction issue. But gesture interfaces remain frustratingly hit-or-miss and typically require holding your fingers up to perform fine motions, which also seems like a bad option if your hands have limited mobility, and I didn’t get to try HTC’s version in my demo. O’Brien says HTC is still toying with options for other control systems — its plan is to release the headset and then tweak its design based on how people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LVAy8"&gt;More generally, it’s not clear HTC’s emphasis on portability is the key to winning over VR doubters. Companies have been pitching “VR you can throw in your bag” for years now, and outside of people whose jobs involve headsets, I haven’t seen a single human being cite that as a selling point — while I’ve heard even skeptics praise bulkier headsets for being comfortable. HTC also says people will feel less awkward wearing this glasses-like design in public settings like airplanes. As someone who actually has worn a VR headset on an airplane, I’m not sure that’s enough to erase its fundamental weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EahLpo"&gt;There isn’t really a clear audience for the Flow in the US market. It’s far more expensive and less feature-rich than the Facebook-subsidized Oculus Quest 2 but without specialized features that might make it appealing for businesses or other organizations. (Film festivals and schools could use a no-frills VR headset for 360-degree video, for instance... but the Flow isn’t it.) HTC has designed social apps like Sync that could have relatively broad appeal. But outside its meditation and video options, my Flow demo didn’t offer a great sense of its day-to-day value. I found mostly small games that I might play occasionally, not tools I’d spend $499 to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5dpgpf"&gt;But HTC has built a strong base of VR business hardware, and for now, it seems content to release the Flow as an experiment. At the very least, you won’t find another major headset like it — even if it does make you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723442/htc-vive-pro-headset-leaked-photos-evan-blass-bug-look"&gt;sort of look like a bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is letting you register for the chance to buy a PS5 for the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5-VrHa1xQdbrNCg4eTa64audlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994014/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="46htYb"&gt;Sony has launched &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/register-to-buy/"&gt;a landing page where you can register for the opportunity to buy a PS5 later this year&lt;/a&gt;, in time for the holidays. The company says it will have “a limited amount of PS5 consoles” for US customers through its PlayStation store. It’s probably a good idea to fill out the registration sooner than later, and you’ll need a PlayStation Network ID to do so. Though, unlike its queueing system for distributing consoles, the selection process here doesn’t seem entirely like a first-come, first-served situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYeQzt"&gt;Sony will begin to send out invitations with instructions to purchase a PS5, along with a slate of accessories if you’d like, in November. And it says that recipients of invites will be “based on previous interests and PlayStation activities.” That’s vague, but perhaps it’ll reward longtime players, or those who have checked the right boxes for its marketing emails. If you get an invite, you’ll want to act quickly, as each will be open for a limited time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="260x6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not everyone will get an invite&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GyxNfy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403245/sony-playstation-5-preorders-invite-only-registration-dualsense-accessories"&gt;This isn’t the first time&lt;/a&gt; that Sony has accepted registrations for a chance to snag a PS5. But toward the middle and end of 2021, console restocks have been increasingly rare. As we approach the holidays, we anticipate that retailers like Amazon and Best Buy may lock further restocks behind their paid memberships (Prime and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17382014/best-buy-total-tech-support-geek-squad-subscription"&gt;Totaltech&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) to incentivize joining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j02t9V"&gt;On one hand, this is good, since it should keep bots at bay, as well as people who may just be focused on flipping consoles for a profit. So in other words, this planned console restock from Sony might be your best chance to secure a console without an extra membership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f21rPk"&gt;Make sure to check out the frequently asked questions section at the bottom of the registration page to make sure you know all the steps ahead of time, to make your checkout process as seamless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>They’re putting guns on robot dogs now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyTiPb8v78C03YvoJle7iZVvZWI=/0x0:1395x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69994006/sword_spur_robot_dog_gun.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not clear if this gun-equipped quadrupedal robot is for sale, but it’s only a matter of time. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sword International&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIBQcz"&gt;Quadrupedal robots are one of the most interesting developments in robotics in recent years. They’re small, nimble, and able to traverse environments that frustrate wheeled machines. So, of course, it was only a matter of	 time until someone put a gun on one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdGR8m"&gt;The image above shows a quadrupedal robot — a Vision 60 unit built by US firm Ghost Robotics — that’s been equipped with a custom gun by small-arms specialists Sword International. It seems the gun itself (dubbed the SPUR or “special purpose unmanned rifle”) is designed to be fitted onto a variety of robotic platforms. It has a 30x optical zoom, thermal camera for targeting in the dark, and an effective range of 1,200 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKHLeV"&gt;What’s not clear is whether or not Sword International or Ghost Robotics are currently selling this combination of gun and robot. But if they’re not, it seems they will be soon. As the &lt;a href="https://sworddefense.com/spur/"&gt;marketing copy&lt;/a&gt; on Sword’s website boasts: “The SWORD Defense Systems SPUR is the future of unmanned weapon systems, and that future is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCFoXJsgjjBD_R-4cRsS2bJWDQU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926431/SPUR_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sword International&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The robot base is built by Ghost Robotics, and carries a specially-designed gun built by Sword International. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M79WdP"&gt;The machine was shown off for the first time at the Association of the United States Army’s 2021 annual conference earlier this week. The conferences bills itself as a “landpower exposition and professional development forum” held in Washington DC, October 11-13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oKbIfl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US military has started testing robot dogs on patrol duty&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="scj5Y9"&gt;Details about the partnership between Ghost and Sword are unclear, but Ghost’s quadrupedal robots are already being tested by the US military. Last year, the 325th Security Forces Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida became the first unit in the Department of Defense to &lt;a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2413766/computerized-canines-to-join-tyndall-afb/"&gt;use quadrupedal robots&lt;/a&gt; in regular operations. It uses them to patrol the base’s perimeter, navigating swampy areas that “aren’t desirable for human beings and vehicles,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/38000/here-is-what-the-air-forces-new-robot-dogs-are-actually-capable-of"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with Ghost Robotics CEO Jiren Parikh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0AKsN"&gt;Although reconnaissance is one of the most obvious use-cases for robot dogs, manufacturers are slowly experimenting with other payloads. As well as providing remote video and mapping, the machines could be used as mobile cell towers, to defuse bombs, or to detect chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear matter (otherwise known as CBRN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9Xn3j"&gt;And, of course, they can become weapons themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9d7zcWUbrRdn9LSjdgkrJ_mp28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926436/ghostrobotics2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ghost Robotics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike the better-known Boston Dynamics, Ghost Robotics seems eager to find military customers for its quadrupedal machines. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3EvVs8"&gt;Boston Dynamics, the best-known manufacturer of quadrupedal robots and makers of Spot, has a strict policy agains weaponizing its machines. Other manufacturers, it seems, aren’t so picky. After all, plenty of companies already sell uncrewed gun platforms that use tank treads or wheels, so adding the same basic kit to legged machines isn’t much of a stretch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5ApTK"&gt;The bigger question is how these robots will be deployed in the future and what level of oversight will be required when they start firing lethal rounds at humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q49Sd"&gt;For a while now, experts have been warning about the slow rise in the use of “killer robots” (known as lethal autonomous weapon systems, or LAWS, in official jargon), and &lt;a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11150.pdf"&gt;official US policy&lt;/a&gt; does not prohibit their development or deployment. Many groups are campaigning for a &lt;a href="https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/"&gt;preemptive ban&lt;/a&gt; on such systems, but, in the meantime, it seems companies will continue to build what is possible. And that means putting guns on robot dogs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to ‘sunset’ LinkedIn for China, and replace it with an app lacking social media features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BSfsJLv50Sy3wR9nh6ZB1GCrDUQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993944/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UxOR3V"&gt;Microsoft announced this morning that it’s shutting down the localized version of LinkedIn for China that has been available there since 2014. The move comes after increasing claims from academics and reporters that they’ve received notifications stating their profiles on the service are blocked in China, as reported recently by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/academics-bristle-over-linkedin-blocking-their-profiles-in-china-11624366667"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCJ3PJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/october/14/china-sunset-of-localized-version-of-linkedin-and-launch-of-new-injobs-app"&gt;its blog post announcing the move&lt;/a&gt; and a plan to launch a new China-only standalone product called InJobs, Microsoft did not directly reference those reports. Instead, it says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="m0yicA"&gt;While we’ve found success in helping Chinese members find jobs and economic opportunity, we have not found that same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed. We’re also facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oHQjtb"&gt;Today, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-abandons-linkedin-in-china-citing-challenging-operating-environment-11634220026?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Chinese government instructed Microsoft to better regulate its content in March, with a 30-day deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HM17ah"&gt;Last year when the Trump administration tried to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356787/go-read-this-microsoft-chinese-tech-roots-tik-tok-acquisition-financial-times"&gt;arrange the acquisition of TikTok by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; (CEO Satya Nadella called it the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697565/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-tiktok-acquisition-drama-strangest-thing"&gt;strangest thing I’ve ever worked on&lt;/a&gt;”), the company’s “immense soft power” in the country was part of making that possible. Outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908713/github-ceo-china-transcript-leak-microsoft"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon’s review system, LinkedIn was the only other foreign-owned platform allowed to host user-generated content in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b0zM0b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"China is making the internet less free, and US tech companies are helping ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18053142/china-internet-privacy-censorship-apple-microsoft-google-democracy-report"},{"title":"Trump pushing Microsoft to buy TikTok was ‘strangest thing I’ve ever worked on,’ says Satya Nadella ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697565/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-tiktok-acquisition-drama-strangest-thing"},{"title":"Why Google might return to China, even if it means censorship ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17647716/google-return-to-china-censorship"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pWDdkM"&gt;Twitter and Facebook have been blocked in China since 2009, while Google &lt;a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; its search operations from mainland China to Hong Kong in 2010. Meanwhile, Microsoft has sanitized Chinese language search results on Bing and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14998644/microsoft-windows-10-china-custom-version"&gt;offered a customized version of Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;. However, as China’s government has broadened a crackdown on tech giants in a manner affecting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615392/china-lawsuit-wechat-tencent-youth-mode-tech"&gt;gaming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22562912/china-regulator-orders-didi-ride-hailing-app-removed"&gt;ride-sharing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;, and more, its requests apparently crossed Microsoft’s self-identified threshold to reevaluate its LinkedIn operations. Apple continues to operate in the country unconstrained.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC is building a new chip factory in Japan, but warns of ‘tight’ supply through 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) logo..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3N9OPsyay4ViA386TrLCLHd5fw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993592/1235442658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SSH6z"&gt;TSMC has announced plans to expand its chipmaking efforts with a new factory in Japan during its Q3 2021 earnings call, marking the latest expansion for what’s already the world’s largest chipmaker, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/taiwans-tsmc-posts-138-rise-q3-profit-global-chip-demand-surge-2021-10-14/?taid=616821a30fbc4500016a4c12&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the news comes as the company also cautions that supply will be “tight” for chips throughout 2022 as a result on the ongoing shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w99kqr"&gt;The new plant is planned to focus on producing chips with older technologies, instead of the bleeding-edge processors that TSMC is best known for providing to companies like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. That’s particularly important, given that it’s those older chips — like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;those found in cars for controlling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;the airbags and seatbelts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;or the power management chip in an iPhone&lt;/a&gt; — that are the ones having the biggest supply issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdutcX"&gt;But it’ll still be a while before the new fab comes online, with production not expected to start until “late 2024.” TSMC is also still finalizing plans for the new factory, with CEO C.C. Wei noting on the company’s earnings call that the new Japan fab still needs approval from TSMC’s board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHjFEX"&gt;TSMC had previously cautioned in April that shortages &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;could last through 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Wei noted then: “In 2023, I hope we can offer more capacity to support our customers. At that time, we’ll start to see the supply chain tightness release a little bit.” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has also echoed concerns about 2022 supply, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57996908"&gt;telling the BBC in July&lt;/a&gt; that it would be “a year or two” before shortages end. And while AMD CEO Lisa Su was more optimistic when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;speaking at the 2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;, she too noted that supply for at least the first half of the year will be “likely tight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUru69"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642627/tsmc-chip-price-increase-supply-shortages-apple-qualcomm"&gt;TSMC is also reportedly raising its prices&lt;/a&gt; for its semiconductor products by around 10 percent for its advanced chips, and by about 20 percent for its less advanced products (the sort of chips that the new Japan factory is meant to help increase supply of) to try to both reduce demand and help fund its planned investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3x7Qt"&gt;And investing to expand its capacity to meet that skyrocketing demand — and help prevent future shortages — is a key priority for the TSMC. The company has already announced plans to invest $100 billion through 2023 to increase its manufacturing capacity, which includes its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;planned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-arizona/phoenix-okays-development-deal-with-tsmc-for-12-billion-chip-factory-idUSKBN27Y30E"&gt;$12 billion manufacturing hub in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and the new Japan fab.&lt;/p&gt;
