    <title>How Twitter got research right</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zug8T1"&gt;It has not been a happy time for researchers at big tech companies. Hired to help executives understand platforms’ shortcomings, research teams inevitably reveal inconvenient truths. Companies hire teams to build “responsible AI” but bristle when their employees discover algorithmic bias. They boast about the quality of their internal research but disavow it when it makes its way to the press. At Google, this story played out in &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;the forced departure of ethical AI researcher Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent fallout for her team. At Facebook, it led to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Frances Haugen and the Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4DGna"&gt;For these reasons, it’s always of note when a tech platform takes one of those unflattering findings and publishes it for the world to see. At the end of October, Twitter did just that. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/22/twitter-admits-bias-in-algorithm-for-rightwing-politicians-and-news-outlets"&gt;Dan Milmo in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mcVGqF"&gt;Twitter has admitted it amplifies more tweets from right-wing politicians and news outlets than content from left-wing sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qEGLJ"&gt;The social media platform examined tweets from elected officials in seven countries – the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and Japan. It also studied whether political content from news organisations was amplified on Twitter, focusing primarily on US news sources such as Fox News, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHWlw6"&gt;The research found that in six out of seven countries, apart from Germany, tweets from right-wing politicians received more amplification from the algorithm than those from the left; right-leaning news organisations were more amplified than those on the left; and generally politicians’ tweets were more amplified by an algorithmic timeline than by the chronological timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HNMZKC"&gt;Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/rml-politicalcontent"&gt;blog post on the subject&lt;/a&gt; was accompanied by &lt;a href="https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/blog-twitter/official/en_us/company/2021/rml/Algorithmic-Amplification-of-Politics-on-Twitter.pdf"&gt;a 27-page paper&lt;/a&gt; that further describes the study’s findings and research and methodology. It wasn’t the first time this year that the company had volunteered empirical support for years-old, speculative criticism of its work. This summer, Twitter hosted an open competition to find bias in its photo-cropping algorithms. James Vincent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617972/twitter-photo-cropping-algorithm-ai-bias-bug-bounty-results"&gt;described the results at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RVCZhr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/bogdan-kulynych/saliency_bias"&gt;top-placed entry&lt;/a&gt; showed that Twitter’s cropping algorithm favors faces that are “slim, young, of light or warm skin color and smooth skin texture, and with stereotypically feminine facial traits.” The second and third-placed entries showed that the system was &lt;a href="https://github.com/erickmu1/Twitter-Algorithmic-Bias"&gt;biased against people with white or grey hair&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting age discrimination, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/royapakzad/image-crop-analysis"&gt;favors English over Arabic script in images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GneboW"&gt;These results were not hidden in a closed chat group, never to be discussed. Instead, Rumman Chowdhury — who leads machine learning ethics and responsibility at Twitter — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLwdzLiJywI"&gt;presented them publicly at DEF CON&lt;/a&gt; and praised participants for helping to illustrate the real-world effects of algorithmic bias. The winners were paid for their contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSpO4o"&gt;On one hand, I don’t want to overstate Twitter’s bravery here. The results the company published, while opening it up to some criticisms, are nothing that is going to result in a full Congressional investigation. And the fact that the company is much smaller than Google or Facebook parent Meta, which both serve billions of people, means that anything found by its researchers is less likely to trigger a global firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY2895"&gt;At the same time, Twitter doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do this kind of public-interest work. And in the long run, I do believe it will make the company stronger and more valuable. But it would be relatively easy for any company executive or board member to make a case against doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JsT4JZ"&gt;For that reason, I’ve been eager to talk to the team responsible for it. This week, I met virtually with Chowdhury and Jutta Williams, product lead for Chowdhury’s team. (Inconveniently, as of&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/technology/facebook-meta-name-change.html"&gt; October 28th&lt;/a&gt;: the Twitter team’s official name is Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability: META.) I wanted to know more about how Twitter is doing this work, how it has been received internally, and where it’s going next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVIKsz"&gt;Here’s some of what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkHRZw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter is betting that public participation will accelerate and improve its findings&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the more unusual aspects of Twitter’s AI ethics research is that it is paying outside volunteer researchers to participate. Chowdhury was trained as an ethical hacker and observed that her friends working in cybersecurity are often able to protect systems more nimbly by creating financial incentives for people to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T022FV"&gt;“Twitter was the first time that I was actually able to work at an organization that was visible and impactful enough to do this and also ambitious enough to fund it,” said Chowdhury, who joined the company a year ago when it acquired her AI risk management startup. “It’s hard to find that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yviwWk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Often, only the loudest voices are addressed, while major problems are left to linger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1WZeIL"&gt;It’s typically difficult to get good feedback from the public about algorithmic bias, Chowdhury told me. Often, only the loudest voices are addressed, while major problems are left to linger because affected groups don’t have contacts at platforms who can address them. Other times, issues are diffuse through the population, and individual users may not feel the negative effects directly. (Privacy tends to be an issue like that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b39V4L"&gt;Twitter’s bias bounty helped the company build a system to solicit and implement that feedback, Chowdhury told me. The company has since announced it will stop cropping photos in previews after its algorithms were found to largely favor the young, white, and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAmzou"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsible AI is hard in part because no one understands fully understands decisions made by algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;. Ranking algorithms in social feeds are probabilistic — they show you things based on how likely you are to like, share, or comment on them. But there’s no one algorithm making that decision — it’s typically a mesh of multiple (sometimes dozens) of different models, each making guesses that are then weighted differently according to ever-shifting factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qop5FK"&gt;That’s a major reason why it’s so difficult to confidently build AI systems that are “responsible” — there is simply a lot of guesswork involved. Chowdhury pointed out the difference here between working on responsible AI and cybersecurity. In security, she said, it’s usually possible to unwind why the system is vulnerable, so long as you can discover where the attacker entered it. But in responsible AI, finding a problem often doesn’t tell you much about what created it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3sYdW"&gt;That’s the case with the company’s research on amplifying right-wing voices, for example. Twitter is confident that the phenomenon is real but can only theorize as to the reasons behind it. It may be something in the algorithm. But it might also be a user behavior — maybe right-wing politicians tend to tweet in a way to elicit more comments, for example, which then causes their tweets to be weighted more heavily by Twitter’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnoQQc"&gt;“There’s this law of unintended consequences to large systems,” said Williams, who previously worked at Google and Facebook. “It could be so many different things. How we’ve weighted algorithmic recommendation may be a part of it. But it wasn’t intended to be a consequence of political affiliation. So there’s so much research to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZqQFo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no real consensus on what ranking algorithms “should” do&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if Twitter does solve the mystery of what’s causing right-wing content to spread more widely, it won’t be clear what the company should do about it. What if, for example, the answer lies not in the algorithm but in the behavior of certain accounts? If right-wing politicians simply generate more comments than left-wing politicians, there may not be an obvious intervention for Twitter to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZomK2G"&gt;“I don’t think anybody wants us to be in the business of forcing some sort of social engineering of people’s voices,” Chowdhury told me. “But also, we all agree that we don’t want amplification of negative content or toxic content or unfair political bias. So these are all things that I would love for us to be unpacking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuXEYG"&gt;That conversation should be held publicly, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqW9Am"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter thinks algorithms can be saved&lt;/strong&gt;. One possible response to the idea that all our social feeds are unfathomably complex and cannot be explained by their creators is that we should shut them down and delete the code. Congress now regularly introduces bills that would make ranking algorithms illegal, or make platforms legally liable for what they recommend, or force platforms to let people opt out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkQwRq"&gt;Twitter’s team, for one, believes that ranking has a future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYK6LT"&gt;“The algorithm is something that can be saved,” Williams said. “The algorithm needs to be understood. And the &lt;em&gt;inputs&lt;/em&gt; to the algorithm need to be something that everybody can manage and control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQXO22"&gt;With any luck, Twitter will build just that kind of system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD3e7x"&gt;Of course, the risk in writing a piece like this is that, in my experience, teams like this are fragile. One minute, leadership is pleased with its findings and enthusiastically hiring for it; the next, it’s withering by attrition amidst budget cuts or reorganized out of existence amidst personality conflicts or regulatory concerns. Twitter’s early success with META is promising, but META’s long-term future is not assured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abz6qo"&gt;In the meantime, the work is likely to get harder. Twitter is now actively at work on a project to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/twitter-taps-crypto-developer-to-lead-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-effort/"&gt;make its network decentralized&lt;/a&gt;, which could shield parts of the network from its own efforts to build the network more responsibly. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also envisioned an “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms"&gt;app store for social media algorithms&lt;/a&gt;,” giving users more choice around how their feeds are ranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W4LoNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not sure it’s feasible for us to jump right into a marketplace of algorithms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ah0YTg"&gt;It’s difficult enough to rank &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; feed responsibly — what it means to make a whole app store of algorithms “responsible” will be a much larger challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zVhn2"&gt;“I’m not sure it’s feasible for us to jump right into a marketplace of algorithms,” Williams said. “But I do think it’s possible for our algorithm to understand signal that’s curated by you. So if there’s profanity in a tweet, as an example: how sensitive are you to that kind of language? Are there specific words that you would consider very, very profane and you don’t want to see? How do we give you controls for you to establish what your preferences are so that that signal can be used in any kind of recommendation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr7GPp"&gt;“I think that there’s a third-party signal more than there is a third-party bunch of algorithms,” Williams said. “You have to be careful about what’s in an algorithm.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter stops opening links in AMP on iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5nTGmtbTqPI7Nzn4DaMquqnFfo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164308/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHPCJj"&gt;Twitter has quietly rolled back its support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) on mobile, according to a &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/amp/overview"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/christian_wilde/status/1460929280486031367"&gt;SEO consultant Christian Oliveira&lt;/a&gt;. The support page originally detailed how Twitter would automatically send users of its mobile apps to the AMP version of a page from links posted on the social network. However, at some point since October 21st, Twitter updated the page with a notice saying it’s retiring the feature by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXGXTT"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/twitter-rolls-back-amp-support-no-longer-sends-users-to-amp-pages-376168"&gt;to data from &lt;em&gt;SearchEngineLand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this retirement process appears to have been completed earlier this month. Now, attempting to visit a page from Twitter appears to send users directly to the regular web page, rather than an AMP version that may be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWBnkMaf-RAycN4vl1V27C_A_6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026927/msedge_OX1DnKyNyR.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter’s notice saying it’s retiring the AMP feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pXWd2B"&gt;Although Twitter notes that the AMP allows for “fast-loading, beautiful, high-performing mobile web experiences,” the technology has proved controversial since Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9467149/google-accelerated-mobile-pages-caching-preview"&gt;introduced it in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the controversy centered around Google’s perceived control of the project, with some critics claiming that it amounted to Google’s attempt to &lt;a href="http://ampletter.org/"&gt;reinforce its control of the open web&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjzIJn"&gt;But it also has more basic user interface problems for a platform like Twitter because of the way it can mess with URLs, when it makes pages appear to be from Google regardless of the website that created them. It’s an annoying situation that’s led to the creation of &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696"&gt;browser extensions which&lt;/a&gt; automatically redirect AMP pages to the original article URL to reduce confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWmGCh"&gt;Twitter’s support document doesn’t give a reason for its change in policy. A spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmMM0n"&gt;The social network’s move follows a policy change from Google itself in May 2020 when it announced that it would &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/amp-wont-be-required-for-googles-top-stories-section-335276"&gt;no longer require news sites&lt;/a&gt; to offer AMP versions of their pages in order to be featured in its search engine’s Top Stories section. The move was a long time coming following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095078/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-page-announcement-standard-web-packaging-urls"&gt;Google initiative launched in May 2018&lt;/a&gt; to take what the company had learned from AMP and turn its features into general web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHRvND"&gt;For more background on AMP, check out this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/25/17898006/google-amp-future-malte-uble-interview-vergecast"&gt;2018 episode of The Vergecast&lt;/a&gt; featuring an interview with AMP’s former tech lead Malte Ubl.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s Grappleshot helps make the familiar feel new</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rga-H7rdmc3qs6nSTj9YVOaiikE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164175/8KMUico.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Halo Infinite is a familiar but different Halo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="f5Zasn"&gt;I wasn’t ready to start sneaking around a Banished warship in my first few minutes in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign, but there I was facing down an army of Grunts, Jackals, Brutes, and Elites. The initial thrill of the classic &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;music and the familiarity of the enemies was a nostalgia overload for a good few minutes, but after it all wore off I noticed the new Grappleshot. Oh, boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzaTPE"&gt;I first played &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; 20 years ago, and while the combination of grenades, melees, and an assortment of weapons and vehicles still remains today, the Grappleshot is an entirely new addition that transforms the campaign mode. It’s an ideal companion that left me excited and wanting to upgrade it fully during my first few hours of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QMSLZ6PC8dB1lFIvTSCrddAVIHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024291/grappleshot.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just Grappleshot Jackal shields to kill them easily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vvnfDF"&gt;You’re introduced to the Grappleshot in the early missions in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, as you fight your way outside toward the open areas of the Zeta Halo that the Banished enemies have taken over. The first level is incredibly vertical, and it acts like a subtle training mode to gently nudge you into mastering the Grappleshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdpsSV"&gt;While you can run, jump, and shoot enemies freely without it, zip lining toward a Brute and punching them in the face is incredibly satisfying. If Jackal’s shields are annoying, just Grappleshot the shield to force them to lower it. It’s also great for instantly figuring out those “How do I get up there?” moments, where you can just aim and transport yourself to areas that would be impossible to get to otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzzwXY"&gt;I’ve been playing around with the Grappleshot for months during the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer previews, and I was impressed with its mobility there, but it has unlimited uses in the campaign. That means it really comes into its own. You can use it to navigate around quicker or to propel yourself toward an enemy, and it can also be used to retrieve items like guns or fusion coils. There’s only a short cooldown in the campaign mode, so the possibilities for speed running are going to be endless. I can’t wait to witness what talented players manage to accomplish here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N02jXTW4lN_cr_pIwmVsSN7rMaw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024268/halozeta.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One part of the Zeta Halo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="djao5x"&gt;The dark and eerie areas in the first few missions of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;where you’re first introduced to the Grappleshot are what you’d expect from classic &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a clear storyline and structure, and plenty of Banished enemies to eliminate. If you’re new to the franchise, the story itself takes place 18 months after the events of &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt;, but the story and adventures really start to expand once you first venture outside onto the Zeta Halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IK7HQj"&gt;It’s here where &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; really sets itself apart from &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;games that have come before it. It still maintains a very &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved &lt;/em&gt;look and feel, but you can freely explore the Zeta Halo, and it’s filled with items to discover, high-value targets to eliminate, outposts to conquer, and of course areas of the main storyline to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvBQTz9FI22213So84El-W6POeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024294/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_11_18_14_23_19.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zeta Halo surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kVbGGw"&gt;While it certainly looks and feels like an open-world &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game at first glance, 343 Industries limits the areas of Zeta Halo you can explore until you’ve progressed and unlocked new areas. It’s difficult to tell right now exactly how big this map will be, but you can pan around and get a sense that there’s plenty to unlock. It certainly sounds vast, and I had to spend a few minutes simply standing still and appreciating the subtle audio of the environment and animals that surrounded me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOeXLR"&gt;You can also earn armor upgrades, improve your Grappleshot abilities, and much more here. I only experienced a few upgrades during my initial preview of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, but there are upgrades to stun grappled enemies for several seconds, reduce the Grappleshot cooldown by 40 percent, deliver a shockwave blast when holding melee while you grapple, and even increase the radius of the shockwave blast. I can’t wait to unlock all of these options and see how truly powerful the Grappleshot can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03v-pk1xkHTlnVHqLfT8CJPDn7U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024230/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_11_18_13_50_18.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grappleshot upgrades look promising.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Wk8h7"&gt;While you can explore the Halo Zeta surface and discover occasional skirmishes and battles, the first main campaign mission here is to infiltrate a huge tower that houses a Banished boss. It’s a dark, steam-filled location that really demonstrates just how good &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;looks running on the Xbox Series X, with lighting that requires you to activate a light on Master Chief’s helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMg78r"&gt;Out of all the initial missions in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, I enjoyed this one the most and it left me wanting more. The boss battle introduces you to the threat sensor, a projectile you can use to track enemies through walls and terrain. The threat sensor is particularly useful against enemies that like to cloak and hide away, and you’ll find high-value targets out in the Halo Zeta that do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjOTE4FhYNQ7I45pG22GBQPvLtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024250/Qi6iPb5.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite starts out dark, eerie, and steam-filled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yYCiqs"&gt;You can choose to equip the threat sensor when you need it in place of the Grappleshot, and I’m curious to see how the campaign progresses to unlock extra equipment and abilities. The progression system works through Spartan Cores, which can be found throughout the main campaign missions or across Zeta Halo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewxGY9"&gt;Once you unlock more vehicles, you can also summon them freely from outposts that you’ve secured. You have to battle Banished forces to capture outposts, following their six-month occupation of the Ring. These outposts reveal new Banished structures, extra high-value targets, and you can use them to rally UNSC Marines who are willing to accompany you on missions and defeat enemies. If you rescue marines out in the field or capture Banished bases, you’ll also earn Valor — a resource that lets you unlock new weapons, vehicles, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTs4Qu"&gt;I’ve only played the first few hours of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; so far, and it already feels like there are many hours ahead of me. The Weapon, a new AI that bares a striking resemblance to Cortana, is introduced early on, and the fate of Master Chief and Cortana’s role in the story are still very much up in the air after just a few hours of gameplay. We’ll have a full review of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; next month, where we’ll find out just how big Zeta Halo is and discover the secrets hidden within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="yCVwar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; already feels like a familiar but different kind of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and one that fans are going to enjoy exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today, a jury got to hear Elizabeth Holmes’ lies for themselves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elizabeth Holmes Fraud Trial Continues" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woga5pNJzxDg8H0U2qB6_pBgj-k=/0x0:3849x2566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70163268/1353830876.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;In her own voice&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Jp2uSH"&gt;Today we heard Elizabeth Holmes speak in court — through recordings made for &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article by Roger Parloff&lt;/a&gt;. In those recordings, Holmes claims that Theranos worked with the military, was currently working with pharmaceutical companies, that the company could do more than a thousand tests on its proprietary machines, and that the results were “at the highest level of quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9lk29"&gt;None of this was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OIwZfY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parloff has about 10 hours of taped conversations with Holmes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xGurpP"&gt;Lying to reporters is not illegal, but it’s generally a bad idea since we tend to record our conversations. We’ve heard a lot about Parloff’s article in US v Elizabeth Holmes, because it was frequently sent to prospective investors as part of the materials Holmes supplied about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DdHhW"&gt;Parloff has about 10 hours of taped conversations with Holmes, the founder and former CEO of Theranos. He profiled Theranos after he noticed fancy celebrity lawyer David Boies had been arguing on behalf of a company Parloff had never heard of — and had won the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIeQ9h"&gt;Parloff interviewed Holmes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— as well as a who’s who of Theranos notables, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Stanford professor Channing Robertson, and Mark Laret, the CEO of UCSF Medical Center. He toured the Palo Alto headquarters of Theranos. He did not see the clinical lab. (Or, for that matter, any third-party analyzers.) He also toured the manufacturing facilities in Newark, California, which he said was “not a buzzing factory — no assembly lines or anything.” He went to a Walgreens and got his blood drawn with a fingerstick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwSTMW"&gt;During the course of their conversation, Parloff pointed out that Quest Diagnostics did 600 different tests. He asked Holmes if Theranos did all those tests, too. “Our platform can yield — I’m thinking of the best way to say this — we can do all those tests, so we can provide data back to clinicians for all the same tests,” she responded. That was a lie — we’ve heard testimony that Theranos devices couldn’t perform more than a handful of tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aGQMi6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She went on to say that Theranos devices had been used in Afghanistan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gradp"&gt;Later, Holmes told Parloff that Theranos has “done work overseas for pharmaceutical companies and a little bit with foreign governments in the past, but right now we’ve got our work cut out for us here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0efta"&gt;She went on to say that Theranos devices had been used in Afghanistan, but he was not to ask her board member, Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis, about it — it was off the record, and besides, Mattis couldn’t talk about it. Earlier in the trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;Mattis testified&lt;/a&gt; that to his knowledge, Theranos devices were never used overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mes6y9"&gt;In another recording, Holmes said that she thought Theranos could do 1,000 tests on its proprietary machines. But only 200 tests are offered on the website, she claimed, because “we have operationalized certain tasks, expecting a certain set of ordering patterns.” The 200 are the most commonly-done ones, she said, “but we are adding to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3b72C"&gt;“Before the article comes out, we may have a new batch,” she added. This didn’t seem true, either — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;particularly given&lt;/a&gt; Theranos’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701542/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-celgene-bickering"&gt;struggles with quality.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bv0wjM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She seemed to be playing him&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mURsqv"&gt;As Parloff’s testimony went on, I noticed how well she seemed to be playing him. At one point, she emailed Parloff to tell him, “As you know we want to generally keep the focus off the hardware. A way to do this if you are referring to it/the automation in our lab is to use the word analyzers which is likely the best word to use besides analytical systems (rather than the word device).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6B4Pn"&gt;Sources don’t get to dictate vocabulary in journalism — at least, not in good journalism. It wasn’t the first time she played Parloff, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBsY2J"&gt;In one recording, she explained that the secrecy was because Theranos hadn’t finished filing its patents. “The fact we have a single device that can perform any test is a big deal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78f17d"&gt;“The next story is that it would be done by this device.” And it wasn’t just one story, she teased: the story after that would be about the decentralization of the devices. “Hopefully we have the opportunity to tell that story with you,” Holmes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hF8uS6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parloff did more due diligence than most people who &lt;em&gt;invested&lt;/em&gt; in Theranos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eqxwvb"&gt;What happened here is pretty obvious — Holmes dangled future exclusives in exchange for the opportunity to dictate the terms of the article, even down to the vocabulary that Parloff used. The word “device” appears twice &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;in his story,&lt;/a&gt; and neither time is it in reference to Theranos machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoqKF4"&gt;Parloff wasn’t a chump, though; by the time he’d written the article, he’d already done more due diligence than most people who &lt;em&gt;invested&lt;/em&gt; in Theranos. He’d heard that Theranos labs were still using venipuncture and asked Holmes about it. She said it was a problem of scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N59pxC"&gt;He pressed: it wasn’t because her system couldn’t run certain tests? She answered by saying it was a matter of volume. “Our biggest point on that is our whole business is about eliminating the need for people to do venipuncture unless they want to, in which case they can, but everything we do is about eliminating that,” Holmes told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GRVXS"&gt;The exchange that defense lawyers are most likely to focus on, however, wasn’t recorded. Parloff asked Holmes directly if she kept, for instance, a Siemens analyzer on hand for overflow. “And she said ‘unh-unh,’ like a nonverbal response that said no,” Parloff testified. This was corroborated only by his notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mkLoFz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The technology is capable of running all those tests.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Wcbtw"&gt;Holmes also emailed Parloff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;the faked Pfizer and Schering-Plough reports&lt;/a&gt; that Theranos actually wrote, complete with conclusions that praised Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mX9J5R"&gt;When the article was published, Holmes was effusive in her praise. She did not request corrections or complain about its contents — frankly unusual for a profile of any tech company. (Ask me about the time Apple spokespeople called to complain not about my &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt; but about my &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pOURz"&gt;Parloff continued talking to Holmes, probably because he was excited about getting more stories; he did get &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2015/05/07/theranos-jump-starts-consumer-lab-testing/"&gt;one about an Arizona law&lt;/a&gt; that made it easier for patients to buy their own lab tests from places such as, well, Theranos. In 2015, she told him that as of that year, Theranos had started using third-party analyzers, because their Arizona lab wasn’t certified to perform Theranos’ lab-developed tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lkLQU"&gt;“The technology is capable of running all those tests,” she told him, lying. As we found out earlier in the trial, Theranos’ devices couldn’t perform more than about a dozen tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBReag"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was remarkable to hear the recordings of Holmes lying in her own voice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3Y6KW"&gt;Later that year, Parloff went to another demo, this time in the Boies Schiller law offices in New York. Two devices were there to perform tests on him: potassium (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;didn’t work&lt;/a&gt; on Theranos devices, a former lab director testified) and Ebola. “Both machines were taking a long time, so I didn’t stay for the results,” Parloff said. He got his results that night. In another recording, Holmes instructed him not to say the same machine ran both of his tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXqYmA"&gt;Then the sky fell. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;John Carreyrou’s &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published in October 2015. In the article, Carreyrou wrote that the majority of Theranos tests were done on third-party devices and Theranos devices were used for just 15 tests. Parloff immediately contacted Holmes. He asked how many tests Theranos could do as of December 2014. According to Parloff, Holmes lied again, saying, “50, 60, maybe 70, we can get you that number.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4CzZB"&gt;It was remarkable to hear the recordings of Holmes lying in her own voice. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;heard now&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783989/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-investor-testimony"&gt;multiple investors &lt;/a&gt;about what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;she told them&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s been consistent: the platform could do basically, well, everything; pharma companies had validated it; it had been used in the battlefield. But those investors didn’t record like Parloff did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qut6Ub"&gt;The defense will argue that Parloff’s cooperation with the prosecution in this trial was sour grapes — a journalist trying to get back at a source who duped him, and who’s trying to pass his own mistakes off onto Holmes. Today, though, the jury got to hear Holmes’ lies in her own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NFT Bay asks if you would steal all the JPEGs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wBLGmte1fJB6_RrASUm1ZLkM-18=/77x0:1946x1246/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70163254/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_14.21.58.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="id__hy46dbgzvam"&gt;In what may be one of the better pieces of performance art this year, Australian Geoffrey Huntley has &lt;a href="https://thenftbay.org"&gt;created a website&lt;/a&gt; that promises to let you torrent an entire blockchain’s worth of NFTs. It’s called, appropriately, The NFT Bay, and it’s an almost exact replica of the famous pirating site (with an added cheeky &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpbay/nft-collector-sells-peoples-fursonas-for-dollar100k-in-right-click-mindset-war"&gt;DMCA takedown&lt;/a&gt; link). As a site, it seems to do what it says on the tin, but as a statement it could spark an interesting discussion around what it means if you claim ownership over something on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gADqzO"&gt;Pretty much every link on the site (except for the one that’s a Rick Roll) will eventually lead you to &lt;a href="https://thenftbay.org/description.html"&gt;the description page&lt;/a&gt;, which would look right at home on the real Pirate Bay (according to my friend, who is definitely not me because I’ve never pirated anything). At the bottom is an actual download link — clicking on it will get you the torrent, letting you download a file called “preview.jpg” which shows off a bunch of Bored Ape images, as well as zip files that supposedly contain all the NFTs from the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. All told, the download is just under 20TB. That is, to put it mildly, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of image files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3WsiPw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; OMG WHO RIGHT CLICKED ALL OF THE &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFTs&lt;/a&gt;?☠️&lt;br&gt;  ‍☠️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/o0YRK78AkL"&gt;https://t.co/o0YRK78AkL&lt;/a&gt;  ‍☠️ &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/g74TFqzX0n"&gt;pic.twitter.com/g74TFqzX0n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— geoff      (@GeoffreyHuntley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1461322836165885954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AOu1TN"&gt;A familiar argument is playing out in the replies to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1461322836165885954"&gt;Huntley’s announcement tweet&lt;/a&gt; — NFT haters point to it as a triumph that proves NFTs have no value, and crypto fans try to prove how unbothered they are by replying in droves that it’s actually the proof of ownership, not the image, that gives NFTs their value. Thinking that you’re getting the same thing by saving the JPEG is a right-click mindset, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhgNWo"&gt;I mean, good art is supposed to spark discussion, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7aEn0I"&gt;For his part, Huntley explains that part of his reasoning for making it was the fact that NFTs very often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;don’t store any media&lt;/a&gt; on the blockchain, instead just linking to a version stored on a potentially fragile web server. He also gives a much more in-depth explanation behind the influences for The NFT Bay in &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/ghuntley/9261d469bc7b0e10789538ddd3609e0b"&gt;an FAQ on his GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdxvw/someone-made-a-pirate-bay-for-nfts"&gt;in an excellent interview with &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="QE5Tv9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ac9b6"&gt;What I enjoy most about The NFT Bay, though, is that it both takes NFT-boosters at their word and pokes fun at the concept. “You want to claim ownership over something,” it asks. “On the internet, that means someone’s going to pirate it.” And Huntley’s announcement message of “OMG WHO RIGHT CLICKED ALL OF THE #NFTs?” takes the “you wouldn’t download a JPEG” meme (shared by both supporters and critics alike) and says “bet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85E7je"&gt;But there remains an obvious question: &lt;em&gt;does it actually contain every NFT on the Ethereum blockchain&lt;/em&gt;? Regrettably, I don’t have an answer for you — trying to download the nearly 15TB zip file would put me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;so far over my data cap&lt;/a&gt; that Comcast would probably break down my door with a battering ram. However, others have shown that it is possible to download all the NFTs, so Huntley isn’t promising the impossible here (basically, your program would just have to find all the tokens on the blockchain and use the links they contain to download the media). Would it impact the artistic statement if someone finally finishes downloading it and discovers it doesn’t contain all the JPEGs? That’s probably something you’ll have to decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3tp1p6tDnspU_RUWXq0kaQ6GJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025976/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_15.22.13.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately my laptop doesn’t have a 20TB internal SSD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="isCfGl"&gt;Unfortunately, it seems like you would have to go through the download process to experience the collection — as far as I can tell, the NFT Bay’s search function just returns the same results no matter what you put in it, despite the tantalizing checkboxes promising to let you see only CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club images. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bEFVbR-v0k14WIPyRjm9BtJoYHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025985/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_15.29.55.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I cackled so hard when I first saw these checkbox, before I realized they didn’t live up to the promise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RH6qrG"&gt;I guess that’s what happens when you’re relying on outdated, centralized, Web 2.0 tech to distribute your stolen NFTs. That’s why I’ll be waiting for the web3 version of LimeWire to build my right-click collection.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ConstitutionDAO loses $43 million auction of rare US Constitution copy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9RtajGW_xasXhrndyT7dedTguFA=/0x0:1746x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70163155/constdao.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of 13 remaining copies of the Official Edition of the Constitution. | Image: Sotheby’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RYbxVr"&gt;A quickly assembled group of crypto enthusiasts who crowdfunded an astonishing $47 million in funds to bid for a rare copy of the US Constitution lost out to a bidder with deeper pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w02mBh"&gt;The group, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787993/constitutiondao-crypto-buy-us-constitution-copy-sothebys-ethereum"&gt;ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, said in an update on Discord that they did not win the auction at Sotheby’s tonight, which sold for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sothebys/status/1461497347377086467"&gt;a total of $43.2 million&lt;/a&gt;. The DAO’s organizers believed they would not have enough money to “insure, store, and transport the document” if they had made a higher bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tp3vD"&gt;The group assembled over the past week, mostly, it seems, because it seemed like a bunch of randos on the internet buying an important historical document would be a funny thing to do. Somehow, they managed to get enough interest to raise a huge sum in Ether. The organizers say they will refund all contributors, minus Ethereum network fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y7HPhQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/6GVxlkvJbj"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6GVxlkvJbj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ConstitutionDAO ( ,  ) (@ConstitutionDAO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1461498841820192771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f4O70j"&gt;“While this wasn’t the outcome we hoped for, we still made history tonight with ConstitutionDAO,” the organizers wrote in an update. “This is the largest crowdfund for a physical object that we are aware of—crypto or fiat. We are so incredibly grateful to have done this together with you all and are still in shock that we even got this far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2RmyH"&gt;The bidding process, which should have been a thrilling and potentially celebratory moment for the thousands of contributors who stayed online to watch, ended up being a chaotic and messy event. Bids were made in person through representatives who bid anonymously on behalf of potential buyers. Bidding quickly jumped to $30 million, then ticked up million by million over the following minutes, with two representatives slowly going back and forth, conferring with the final pair of potential buyers by phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTIZyr"&gt;But no one knew which of the two representatives were bidding on behalf of ConstitutionDAO. In the group’s Discord, people spammed guesses about which of the two representatives was on their side. Even once the auction wrapped, no one knew who the winner was, and conflicting information trickled out through tweets and Twitter Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnIkFZ"&gt;More than 10 minutes after bidding ended, ConstitutionDAO organizers finally posted an official update stating that they had not won the bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOVDEr"&gt;Despite the loss, the DAO’s ability to raise so much money so quickly, to garner the excitement of thousands, and to push the price up against another wealthy party is the latest example of individuals organizing at a large scale online. We’ve increasingly seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks"&gt;consumers join together financially&lt;/a&gt; to stand up to larger interests — though not always in successful or entirely coherent ways — like when a bunch of Redditors sent the stock of GameStop and a handful of other companies soaring in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSEvA8"&gt;If it had succeeded, the DAO planned to determine the document’s future by vote based on governance tokens passed out to contributors and distributed through the Ethereum blockchain. With a loss instead, the DAO has to tackle another logistical issue: returning $47 million in Ether and dissolving what had, for a brief couple of days, been a multi-million dollar organization.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GeForce Now is about to start streaming PC games directly to LG’s TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DMCjOlT537JnRH18nfmts6fygU=/103x0:1498x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162769/LG_NVIDIA_GeForce_NOW_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A beta of GeForce Now is coming to some LG TVs running webOS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eA4eos"&gt;LG first said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224359/google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now-lg-tv-2021"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service was headed to some of its TVs, and now, it’s finally here — though as a beta. LG is rolling out the beta this week for “select 2021 LG 4K OLED, QNED Mini LED, and NanoCell TV models in 80 markets,” &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/11/lg-to-bring-nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-to-webos-smart-tvs/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PSxW5"&gt;GeForce Now lets you play PC games you own on other devices via the cloud, and this new webOS app will make it easier to use the service on a bigger screen. That said, games will be capped at 60fps and 1080p resolution — you won’t be able to play GeForce Now games in 4K via the webOS app. (That feature is currently &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/21/shield-tv-geforce-now-4k-hdr-gaming/"&gt;exclusive to Nvidia’s Shield TV set-top box&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRbuaV"&gt;Every GeForce Now tier is supported, Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, including the new tier that lets you play games on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;its dedicated RTX 3080 pods&lt;/a&gt;. Every gamepad-supported game works, too, the company says. If you don’t own any PC games yourself but still want to give the service a spin, there are more than 35 free-to-play games available on GeForce Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kORakc"&gt;Nvidia says it plans to improve upon the current app by releasing updates in partnership with LG through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Target","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Amazon","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $257 or in white for $245. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13e6oH"&gt;If you’re looking for discounts on Apple’s high-end AirPods Max, the excellent noise-canceling headphones are currently on sale in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for just $479&lt;/a&gt;, a hefty $70 off. It may not be the all-time low as far as pricing goes, but it’s the closest you can get right now if you’re shopping early. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SnzpqH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Amazon is currently offering some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/4998f143?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=26&amp;amp;imprToken=c2be8a99-20b2-dfab-0c4&amp;amp;showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_8_4998f143_dt_sl5_f1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22541018%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;excellent savings on a variety of Shure microphones&lt;/a&gt;. These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u3IApI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $210 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $215 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="FfgzdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ejfdaH"&gt;Best Buy Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning the retailer will refund the price difference of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfZfEpiMWAR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nl3yNN"&gt;Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts on LG’s C1 OLED&lt;/a&gt; as Amazon, while adding a few other perks. These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzBPD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of other products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is currently selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $280. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="m_7721606980660150198sIzbeu"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy at an all-time low. Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $220. Like the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzQ0Njg2L2FwcGxlLWFpcnBvZHMtdGhpcmQtZ2VuLXJldmlldw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Be70b5668" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 AirPods Pro come with a new charging case that &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTgvMjI3MzMxODMvYXBwbGUtbWFnc2FmZS1jaGFyZ2luZy1jYXNlLWFpcnBvZHMtcHJvLXFp/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bd83707a1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;works with Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging system&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $130 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUs7A8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $100 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $1,100 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AhcBZ8"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wijGQu"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3zmNuJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AuzgvG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848365"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li id="ZZr7KF"&gt;Sony’s ZV-1 point-and-shoot camera is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1566753-REG%2Fsony_sony_zv_1_digital_camera.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $746&lt;/a&gt; with a vlogger accessory kit at B&amp;amp;H, a savings of $150. The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which affords you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jv2SvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptops to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNqjUh"&gt;First off, the Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="WjTQz6"&gt;Google Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lM9o24"&gt;Everyone’s favorite omnipotent Apple alternative, Google, recently started rolling out its savings ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from phones and smart speakers to comprehensive home security systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJykoB"&gt;For starters, a rare discount on the Google Pixel 5A has &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reduced the price of the phone to $400 at the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, knocking $50 off the regular price. While all eyes are on the new Pixel 6, we still stand by the Pixel 5A as a solid and affordable entry. Featuring one of the best cameras available in a midrange smartphone, the 5G-compatible 5A also comes equipped with 128GB of onboard storage, IP67 water resistance, and improved battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mSx6Mp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ek0Q9D"&gt;The Google Nest Hub is the best and biggest smart home assistant in the Google ecosystem. Currently, you can save $50 on this smart hub at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Charcoal%2F842552117%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $180. The display’s built-in camera allows you to make video calls, and the 10-inch screen allows you to access media from your favorite streaming services or cast just about anything from your phone. In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted that we were particularly impressed by this device's ability to display personalized content based on who is looking at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UwbkDP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xfNVil"&gt;This accessible Roku alternative from Google features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and the current sale at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has brought the Chromecast with Google TV down to $40, saving you $10 off the regular price. The streaming device features access to all of your favorite streaming services and has a built-in voice assistant to help you find your favorite shows. You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can also grab a bundle with a single access point for $180, or two access points for $250. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TBbF8K"&gt;Samsung Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2nef2l"&gt;Samsung has kicked off its Black Friday discounts with some substantial savings on its Galaxy line of smartphones, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3. While you have the option to compound these savings by trading in an existing tablet or phone, these are the lowest prices we’ve seen for these devices outside those that require a trade-in or plan commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGJaTI"&gt;Right now, Samsung is currently offering $100 off the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1QBl83n22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version of the Galaxy Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; (regularly $1,000). Purchasing this foldable phone also nets you a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2 in the color your choice. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HCuv4y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6enBz"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1QzTIRUoj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 is on sale for just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; at Samsung, $100 off the list price. While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook. While free is generally a good thing, just note that the model on offer here isn’t exactly premium, as it comes with just 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oYwm9o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10388305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qLtKzl"&gt;The current deal on the 128GB Galaxy S21 will save you $100, bringing the price down to just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1Qzpg5cUw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$700 at Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only model currently on sale that doesn’t net you any extra goodies, but it’s a solid value regardless. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBjnYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeWmRN"&gt;Finally, we have the slick Galaxy Z Fold 3, which is on sale in the 256GB configuration with a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2 &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1QyWA3yMw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,550 at Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,800, Samsung’s current discount makes for one of the better deals we’ve seen on the luxury foldable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cQz717"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uVo587"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best smartphone you can buy for under $500","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3gBkxx"&gt;Although these earbuds are available elsewhere for the same price, it's worth noting that both the Pro and Live versions of the Samsung Galaxy Buds have received a significant discount on the Samsung website. Regularly $200, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro are currently on sale for $150&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how much we loved their amazing sound quality and IPX7 water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dNjozo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ25Z7"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are another great option if you’re looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds. Normally these shiny ear beans cost $170, but are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L2koJ344" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for just $100&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their unconventional shape, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our reviewer Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt; liked their overall sound quality and marathon battery life, but thought the noise cancellation could use some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ul0VTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xgjs1u"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th and has been running similar deals every week since. The retail store also officially launched its weekly &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187778/2092?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridaySales111221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Holiday Best” deals&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, which run every Sunday online and in-store. Target will also be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kGsRxP"&gt;Probably the best deal Target has going for it right now is its &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CcA5Vj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is also currently selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $180. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1141873/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now, $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold. Target’s current discount was supposed to expire on November 6th, however, it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6bMV4g"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frazer-viper-8-khz-ambidextrous-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-8000-hz-polling-rate%2F-%2FA-82718043&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Target for $50&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ey6aVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhp-15-6-34-laptop-with-windows-home-in-s-mode-intel-core-i3-11th-gen-processor-8gb-ram-memory-256gb-ssd-storage-silver-15-dy2035tg%2F-%2FA-82457999&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at Target for $430 instead of $540. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. Like the Beats Solo 3 deal, the discount was supposed to expire on November 7th, meaning its duration is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue superstore recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire soon. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;Below, we’ve collected a handful of deals that piqued our interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $79&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3y9ZWs"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MediaTek’s new Dimensity 9000 flagship could compete with Qualcomm’s top-tier Snapdragon chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4slEI1ao4vAnpgNt-xQBvC0A7xI=/121x0:1654x1022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162443/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.12.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="goAfye"&gt;MediaTek has just announced its latest flagship processor: the Dimensity 9000, the company’s most powerful chip ever that looks like it should be able to go head to head with the best chips that more popular competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZACaL"&gt;Where previous top-tier Dimensity chips (like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/dimensity-1000-series"&gt;Dimensity 1000)&lt;/a&gt; were still less powerful than contemporaries like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 or Samsung’s Exynos 2100, the new Dimensity 9000 is coming out of the gate to make a case for 2022 Android flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hd9pC8mvi0gT5J0qduWPN2LjCsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025826/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.14.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7kU3pO"&gt;The new Dimensity 9000 is the first mobile chip to be built on TSMC’s 4nm process, in addition to using Arm’s new v9 architecture. It’s also the first announcement CPU to use Arm’s new core designs: a single Cortex-X2 performance core clocked at 3.05GHz, three Cortex-A710 cores at 2.85GHz, and four Cortex-A510 efficiency cores at 1.8GHz. The GPU, meanwhile, is a 10-core Arm Mali-G710, along with MediaTek’s fifth-generation APU with six total cores for AI processing (which the company says offers four times the performance and power efficiency compared to its previous generation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sldTPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first 4nm smartphone processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IHP3V"&gt;The new 18-bit Imagiq Gen 7 ISP claims to be the world’s first chip to be capable of capturing a 320-megapixel image (assuming your phone has a sensor that can shoot at that level), capable of transferring data at 9 gigapixels per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SL4KM"&gt;As one might expect for a modern smartphone chip, the Dimensity 9000 offers an onboard 5G modem with support for the 3GPP’s Release 16 specification. Notably, though, the new chip still lags behind competitors by only offering built-in sub-6GHz 5G support, without the faster mmWave standard. The Dimensity 9000 does claim to be the first smartphone to support Bluetooth 5.3 and will work with Wi-Fi 6E, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz0lq3"&gt;It’s likely that MediaTek won’t be alone for long when it comes to using the latest Arm technologies — Qualcomm, for example, is widely expected to announce a successor to its Snapdragon 888 chipset at its annual Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th. But even if MediaTek finds that the Dimensity 9000 is merely in the same weight class as whatever Qualcomm announces this year, instead of a leap ahead, that’s a big win for MediaTek, which has largely lagged behind until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSRCZ1"&gt;MediaTek has long been an also-ran when it comes to major Android devices, but the Dimensity 9000 shows that it’s finally looking to really compete. The question now is whether phone manufacturers are ready to join it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several states are investigating how Instagram keeps kids on the platform</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPIhun"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-co-leads-nationwide-investigation-into-instagrams-impact-on-young-people"&gt;group of state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ago.nebraska.gov/news/ag-peterson-joins-nationwide-investigation-instagram%E2%80%99s-impact-young-people"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; an investigation into “the techniques utilized by Meta to increase the frequency and duration of engagement” of children and teens on Instagram and the negative effects that may cause (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-effects-on-children-is-being-investigated-by-coalition-of-states-11637262000"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The group, which includes officials from California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Vermont, accuses the company of doing this despite reports that its own research showed its platform could have a negative effect on young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VmnOr"&gt;The research in question was exposed in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;a report from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the company’s own documents show “Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls.” It was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;discussed in a Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt;, where Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said that the company is unlikely to change its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;habit of putting profits above people’s well-being&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation will be looking into whether the company broke consumer protection laws in its quest to keep people engaging with content on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1wf2ib"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s whistleblower report confirms what researchers have known for years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="m1AnHU"&gt;This group of attorneys general isn’t the only one taking action against Meta — Ohio’s attorney general is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785206/ohio-suing-facebook-instagram-meta-misled-investors-children"&gt;suing the company separately&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the company of misleading the public about its products’ effects on children. Meta said the suit was “without merit” and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;largely pushed back against the reports&lt;/a&gt; from outlets like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, saying that the research published lacked context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usv4Ak"&gt;Some of the attorneys general involved in the investigation announced on Thursday were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428710/facebook-instagram-children-under-13-attorney-general-letter-data-collection-coppa"&gt;involved in an effort earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; to convince Meta — then Facebook — to stop working on an Instagram for kids. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;previously announced its goal&lt;/a&gt; of making a version of the social network for people younger than 13 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;would later say&lt;/a&gt; it was “pausing” work on it. Senate and House lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;have called the pause&lt;/a&gt; “insufficient,” arguing that the company had “completely forfeited the benefit of the doubt when it comes to protecting young people online, and it must completely abandon” the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LgzxRs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meta is concerned about young people not using its products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7waulI"&gt;The company has made it clear that it wants to focus on the younger generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;amid internal concerns&lt;/a&gt; that it’s struggling to attract and keep the attention of teens and 20-somethings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg himself said&lt;/a&gt; in October that he wanted “serving young adults” to be some teams’ “north star.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv7iuw"&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigative effort with Nebraska’s AG, said in a press release that Meta “failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health — exploiting children in the interest of profit.” She vowed that the coalition would “get to the bottom of this company’s engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lNzQD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 18th, 6:53PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original version of this post misstated that the Ohio attorney general was suing the state. The suit is actually against Meta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
