    <title>California regulators think T-Mobile lied to get Sprint merger approved</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The California Public Utilities Commission is displeased with T-Mobile.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTVLvz"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M398/K955/398955746.PDF"&gt;a ruling published on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile made false and misleading statements in testimony to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) about its plans for Sprint’s legacy CDMA network. The company will have the opportunity to explain why it shouldn’t face sanctions for violating the commission’s rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwDGYx"&gt;The decision comes after a long back-and-forth that started with a petition from Dish Network in April asking the Commission to modify its decision on the Sprint acquisition. Dish claimed that T-Mobile made statements under oath that indicated the company would shut down Sprint’s 3G CDMA network in a three-year timeframe. When T-Mobile announced it would decommission the network on January 1st, 2022, Dish cried foul and appealed to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qSyo3w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A recent letter from the DOJ acknowledged ‘grave concerns’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGJGQb"&gt;It would seem that CPUC agrees with Dish. It cited testimony given by T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray, who it says neglected to mention that the PCS spectrum the CDMA network occupies would be needed for its 5G build-out. Ray also stated that maintaining the legacy network would not impact its plans for 5G expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLKqTQ"&gt;When Dish called out the 2022 CDMA shutdown date as premature, T-Mobile then claimed that the short timeframe was necessary because that PCS spectrum &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be needed to support 5G services after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QdHh6L"&gt;The Commission relied on the specific false statements, omissions, and/or misleading assurances T-Mobile gave regarding its use of the PCS spectrum and its repeated references to a three-year customer migration period without a degraded experience in framing D.20-04-008. Further, it appears that these false statements, omissions and/or misleading assurances and the related time references were intended to induce the Commission to approve the merger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eUXYLb"&gt;As a refresher, T-Mobile agreed to sell Sprint’s prepaid brand Boost Mobile to Dish as a condition of the merger deal. The idea was to set Dish up to fill the void in the wireless market that Sprint would leave as the fourth national carrier. The newly acquired Boost customer base — many of who still rely on the older CDMA network — would help Dish get a running start as it built out its own wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84Fpf0"&gt;That’s... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;not really working out how regulators envisioned&lt;/a&gt;, to the surprise of nobody who was paying attention at the time. But while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;a recent letter from the Department of Justice to T-Mobile and Dish&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged “grave concerns” regarding the CDMA shutdown, this ruling from CPUC goes a step further to potentially impose sanctions on T-Mobile. If the company can’t provide an adequate reason for violating the Commission’s rules, it may be ordered to pay up to $100,000 in fines for each of its offenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UchDu5"&gt;That, unfortunately, doesn’t sound like a whole lot of money, especially considering what T-Mobile stands to earn from Boost customers as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;attempts to convert them with waived fees and discounted plans&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, T-Mobile will have the chance to defend itself at its virtual hearing scheduled for September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drought-choked Colorado River faces an unprecedented water shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENVIRONMENT-DROUGHT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYmAJ-PHjIVs9RCuMfFIhkFKyF4=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733865/1234075312.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Intake towers for water to enter to generate electricity and provide hydroelectric power stand during low water levels due the western drought on July 19, 2021 at the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River at the Nevada and Arizona state border. | Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="byaCmP"&gt;For the first time ever, there’s an official water shortage at the largest water reservoir in the US. Today, the US Bureau of Reclamation &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/#/news-release/3950"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; a water shortage at Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, which 25 million people across the Western US and Mexico rely on for water. It’s the first time this kind of declaration had been made&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the Colorado River, the main source of water for Lake Mead, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/16/us/lake-mead-colorado-river-water-shortage/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/megadrought-spurs-first-ever-federal-colorado-river-cutbacks/"&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/a&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zD6ls"&gt;The declaration will trigger mandatory cuts to water use starting January 1, 2023. California, Arizona, and Nevada all tap water from Lake Mead. Based on federal guidelines for shortages brokered in 2019, Arizona will lose 18 percent of its annual apportionment of water from Lake Mead, and Nevada will lose seven percent of their annual allotment. Mexico, which also gets water from the watershed, will lose five percent of its share. California won’t face cuts just yet, because it has stronger water rights under complex water sharing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tKNqb7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the worst droughts in decades continues to plague the Western US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vL8E2"&gt;The water level at Lake Mead reached a historic low in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, dropping to &lt;a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/levels.html"&gt;1,071.57&lt;/a&gt; feet above sea level. By January, when mandatory cuts come into effect, water in the reservoir is expected to reach just 1,065.85 feet above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCZKG6"&gt;One of the worst droughts in decades continues to plague the Western US. Back in June, it was already “the most exceptional drought that we’ve ever shown on the map in the Western US,” according to Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who creates maps for the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. The drought has grown worse since then, and now affects a whopping &lt;a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/512cef7647fe42698dc05dd4e75d4343/page/page_3/"&gt;95 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcyQEe"&gt;The news comes on the heels of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;major United Nations climate report&lt;/a&gt; that found that climate change is supercharging the water cycle, which is fueling more intense droughts and extreme weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTlEno"&gt;“It’s not like drought is a new phenomenon. There are parts of the world that are dealing with these conditions every day of the year. What we’re seeing, however, is that the overall set of expected conditions is moving into uncharted territory,”  Alex Ruane, one of the authors of the new report and a research physical scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the latest and greatest Samsung and Apple earbuds lock you into their world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HefXsWVG753LiuDNXZwarCszYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733468/IMG_1106_Edited_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The recently-announced Galaxy Buds 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jawll"&gt;People always look at me weirdly when I say that I use Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; with my iPhone 12 Pro. But it’s a pairing that makes sense for me: First, I need something that sits entirely within my ear, without a stem that’s going to risk being knocked about by a bike helmet’s strap. Second, they work with Samsung’s companion Galaxy Buds app on iOS, so I can still access their advanced features. And third? I just love that they’re shaped like little kidney beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN0gX0"&gt;But if you were to try the same thing with Samsung’s newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt; Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; you’ll find Samsung’s iOS earbud companion app hasn’t been updated to support them. Samsung wants you to buy a Samsung phone, so it appears to be locking you out of numerous little features, much like how Apple’s AirPods Pro are similarly restricted if you try to use them with an Android phone, or how OnePlus’ earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445641/oneplus-buds-standalone-app-android-phones"&gt;were missing key features when used with non-OnePlus Android devices&lt;/a&gt; at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAZ1Yk"&gt;While I can happily use the iOS companion app to tweak and update last year’s Buds Live, the same app won’t be able to recognize Samsung’s latest buds. If you’re an iPhone user, it’s an annoying enough situation that it feels like Samsung isn’t interested in your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP8Xh3"&gt;But how bad is the ecosystem lock-in with Apple and Samsung’s latest earbuds really? Here are the specific ways you’ll miss out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="JEv4OF"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2’s ecosystem lock-in versus AirPods Pro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ayrNuH"&gt;Before we get into the details, here’s a chart showing which features you get with the AirPods Pro and Galaxy Buds 2, depending on whether you use the earbuds with iOS or Android: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLOEmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10703823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2JRPBf"&gt;The good news is that basic functionality, like being able to listen to music and access playback controls from the buds themselves, is available regardless of whether you use the earbuds on iOS or Android. So too can you control features like noise-cancellation and transparency (aka ambient) modes, which aim to block out and let in outside noise, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWIJOZ"&gt;But lacking a companion app or native operating system support means you simply can’t access certain earbuds’ features if you’re not using the earbuds on their own platform. Most AirPods Pro controls are built directly into iOS, for example, while Samsung’s Galaxy Buds companion app doesn’t support its recent true wireless earbuds on iOS. That means you’re out of luck if you want to update either earbuds’ firmware on a competing operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQgz4m"&gt;These are the kinds of features that you could grow to miss in the long term, especially if you ever need to troubleshoot any problems. If your earbuds encounter a bug, there’s no chance of getting updated firmware to fix it if you’re on Android. Or if you suspect that your AirPods Pro’s battery is draining too quickly while listening to music on an Android phone, you don’t have an official battery indicator to troubleshoot what’s going wrong (although iOS’s system-level battery indicators mean this isn’t a problem for iPhones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esT1Pz"&gt;In some cases there are third-party apps designed to fill in the blanks. For example, the Android apps &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotarrow.assistantTrigger"&gt;Assistant Trigger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pro.vitalii.andropods&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;AndroPods&lt;/a&gt; promise to show your AirPods battery life and allow you to access your phone’s voice assistant such as Google Assistant with a squeeze or tap of the AirPods’ stem. But user reviews of both apps are mixed, and they’re clearly no replacement for official native support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GvE4V_5ezL8yYRQFDA0uPj1WyN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21700189/IMG_0628_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The beans offer iOS app sport, why not newer earbuds? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QqURmv"&gt;It’s also technically possible to use a tap-and-hold gesture to activate Siri when using Samsung’s Galaxy Buds with an iPhone. But in order to do so you have to customize the earbuds’ gesture controls, which default to activating noise-canceling and ambient modes. And customizing those controls relies on a companion app that doesn’t exist on iOS. It restricts easy access to a feature that, depending on your needs, you might rely on every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7O0yF"&gt;Apple and Samsung’s ability to lock you into an ecosystem extends to features that aren’t directly comparable as well. First is that the AirPods’ ability to automatically switch between audio sources only works on Apple devices like iPhones and iPads. It’s not able to automatically switch between an iPad and an Android phone, for example. Samsung’s Buds 2 don’t have a comparable feature, although the company included a version of it on the Buds Pro where it could automatically switch between Samsung phones and Samsung tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSsLSt"&gt;Next, both Apple and Samsung technically have features that let you find their respective earbuds using an app, but they’re very different. Apple’s is called “Find My” and currently it can show you where you might have left your AirPods on a map, based on the last time they were connected to your own phone. With iOS 15 this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;functionality is expanding&lt;/a&gt; by tapping into Apple’s Find My network, meaning other people’s Apple devices will also be able to report the location of your headphones. Either way, the feature is technically cross-platform since it’s accessible via a browser, even on Android. Samsung doesn’t have any of this map-based functionality, although like Apple its companion app includes a simpler option to have your earbuds play a sound to help you find them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5IQtoZNlyhZ5CvB3JcPj8gUkng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336095/akrales_191030_3763_0471.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3dA6vq"&gt;There are also differences in how the earbuds handle pairing. On iPhone, simply opening an AirPods case near your phone is enough to get the pairing process started. But even when you’re on a Samsung phone you have to head into its companion app before you start the official pairing process. Google has its own version of the AirPods’ pairing process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/31/16584442/fast-pair-android-easy-simple-bluetooth-pairing"&gt;called Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s yet to become ubiquitous almost four years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNKQVa"&gt;None of these missing features will fundamentally stop you from using either pair of earbuds to listen to music on the “wrong” platform. But it’s a hassle to have to hunt the Play Store for unofficial third-party apps to unlock basic functionality, or borrow a friend’s phone just to do a firmware update. Especially when you know you can avoid these problems with a different pair of earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bTLSH8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Looks easier and easier to stick around in iPhone land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWsiKh"&gt;And that might be what Apple and Samsung are banking on: if they can convince you to pair their earbuds with their smartphones in blissful harmony, then they know they’ve given you one more reason to stick around in their ecosystem. Yes, it’s easy to replace that outdated iPhone with an Android by itself, but then your AirPods, and maybe even your Apple Watch, and HomePod all won’t work as well. In the end, it makes it look easier and easier to stick around in iPhone land. Sure, Apple might sell a few thousand more AirPods if they worked better on Android, but at the risk of losing much-costlier iPhone sales. It might be why Samsung recently revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620869/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-3-samsung-wearable-google-smartwatch-tizen-one-ui"&gt;its new flagship Google watch won’t work with the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAPT4f"&gt;In portable audio land, it all means that, unless you have a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;strong preference for Apple or Samsung’s earbuds, you’ll get a more complete experience with less hassle by pairing like with like. You can fight ecosystem lock-in all you want, but sometimes it’s just easier to go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcmKfd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California accuses Riot of misleading employees about their right to speak up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LiyBGiOHJvk-rNgCT3cPqfMLahw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733466/acastro_190522_1777_riot_games_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3GmR9Z"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing issued a statement saying Riot Games has failed to inform its employees of their right to speak to the government about instances of harassment and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7SZWG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2021/08/Riot_PR2021-08-16.pdf"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, the DFEH — the body &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;also suing Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for discrimination and harassment — stated that it has asked the courts, “to compel Riot Games Inc.’s compliance with the Court’s June 4, 2021 order requiring the company to send a notice to its workers about their rights to speak with DFEH.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXcCsA"&gt;In 2018, an &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483"&gt;extensive investigation by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed Riot Games fostered an environment in which female employees were harassed, belittled, and passed up for promotion. In November of that year, one current and one former employee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18069714/league-of-legends-riot-games-sued-gender-discrimination"&gt;filed a class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; accusing Riot Games of gender-based discrimination. In 2019, Riot settled that lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20992317/riot-games-settlement-details-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;paying out $10 million dollars&lt;/a&gt; to current and former female employees who worked at the company from 2014 to 2019. Riot’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275059/riot-games-ceo-investigation-gender-discrimination-sexual-harassment-allegations"&gt;Nicolo Laurent was accused of harassing a female executive assistant&lt;/a&gt; but the special task force charged with investigating the claim found &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334483/riot-games-ceo-nicolo-laurent-harassment-discrimination-investigation-closed"&gt;“no evidence”&lt;/a&gt; of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UDwikx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DFEH says such agreements have “a chilling effect on the willingness of individuals to come forward with information that may be of importance to the DFEH as it seeks to advance the public interest in the elimination of unlawful employment discrimination and harassment.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RADikw"&gt;In its investigation of Riot Games, the DFEH found language in settlements between the company and employees that “suggested employees could not voluntarily and candidly speak with the government about sexual harassment and other violations.” In response, the DFEH petitioned the courts to compel Riot to issue a notice to its employees that informs them of their rights to speak to the government about harassment or discrimination regardless of any non-disclosure or non-disparagement agreements they might have signed. The DFEH says such agreements have “a chilling effect on the willingness of individuals to come forward with information that may be of importance to the DFEH as it seeks to advance the public interest in the elimination of unlawful employment discrimination and harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4sbXM"&gt;The courts granted the DFEH’s request and ordered Riot Games to issue a corrective notice, but the DFEH claims Riot still hasn’t done so two months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0P0drn"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; a Riot spokesperson said that “notices are being sent to former employees to confirm that Riot’s severance agreements have never in any way prohibited speaking to government agencies.” The Riot spokesperson also refuted the DFEH’s claims regarding settlement language potentially warning employees from speaking to the government. The spokesperson sent a screenshot of a portion of the company’s severance agreement which stated, “Nothing in this agreement prohibits you from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity.” The spokesperson noted this had been standard language in the company’s severance agreement for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftZXUp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose between the Dell XPS 13 OLED and the Asus ZenBook 13 OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED open on a table. The screen displays a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elJIOGLrK6C8BYHyw28wW8zQ6OI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733253/mchin_20190905_4631_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nAvSBT"&gt;OLED has been commonplace in high-end TVs for quite a while, but it’s still making its way into the laptop mainstream. That’s good news for shoppers looking for a more vibrant multimedia experience. OLED panels have unbeatable contrast ratios, combining the blackest possible blacks with the whitest possible whites. They bring entertainment to a new level, and they can lend a hand with creative photo and video work, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h6laI"&gt;Not too long ago, OLED laptops were a luxury purchase. But smaller mainstream OLED devices are becoming more common each year. Whether you’re a die-hard OLED enthusiast or you’re just looking for a way to upgrade your movie-watching experience, you now have two excellent 13-inch OLED machines to choose from: the Dell XPS 13 and the Asus ZenBook 13. The question is — which one should you buy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIz6YK"&gt;The TL;DR is that the XPS is a more expensive and more niche purchase, while the ZenBook has more configuration options. The specs and prices should make that clear. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/xn9310cto235h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s machine&lt;/a&gt; only comes with an Intel Core i7-1185G7 — there are no other processor options. You can pair that processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,549.99, and can upgrade that to 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM for $1,999.99 or 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $2,269.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6WjK1"&gt;With the ZenBook 13 OLED, you can actually choose your processor. For the starting price of $799.99, you can get an &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202106AM030000001/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-OLED-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-AMD-Ryzen-5-5500U%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-PCIe-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Wi-Fi-5%2C-Windows-10-Home%2C-Pine-Grey%2C-UM325UA-DS51"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5500U, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000002/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i5-1135G7%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-256GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-DS51"&gt;Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can get &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000003/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i7-1165G7%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-ES71"&gt;a Core i7-1165G7&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM260000011/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-OLED-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-AMD-Ryzen-7-5700U%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-PCIe-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Wi-Fi-5%2C-Windows-10-Home%2C-Pine-Grey%2C-UM325UA-DS71"&gt;Ryzen 7 5700U&lt;/a&gt;, both with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, for $899.99. On top of that, there’s a model with a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000001/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i7-1165G7%2C-16GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-XS74"&gt;Core i7-1165G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAskqe"&gt;So these laptops fill pretty different niches. The ZenBook offers affordable options for a variety of needs, while the XPS is a powerful computer for folks with deeper pockets. The main question to ask yourself is whether the extra benefits of the OLED XPS are worth that extra money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18W5ct"&gt;To help you answer that question, I’ve got a summary of each product’s selling points and drawbacks below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NiJyPZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Best laptop 2021: 15 best laptops you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED keyboard seen from above. The screen displays an LED numpad." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1dxILnkKa35DIClFdCx9TQJ-JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424430/mchin_20190626_4502_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenBook has a few neat benefits, including an LED numpad on the touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wYvpcU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ZenBook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D8fQbE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Processor options: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD Ryzen 5500U, Intel Core i5-1135G7, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, Intel Core i7-1165G7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYKPGO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RAM options: &lt;/strong&gt;8GB, 16GB (only available with Core i7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SfK6DS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Storage options: &lt;/strong&gt;256GB (only available with Core i5), 512GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2N1DMy"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dimensions and weight: &lt;/strong&gt;11.97 x 7.99 x 0.55 inches, 2.5lbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oq0WQZ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Battery size: &lt;/strong&gt;67Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DaDmPp"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Display resolution: &lt;/strong&gt;1920 x 1080&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jJPlN7"&gt;Don’t let the low price fool you — Asus’ ZenBook 13 OLED is one of the best 13-inch laptops you can buy. Its main selling point is battery life. The AMD configuration that I reviewed was a standout in this area, averaging over 11 hours in my testing. It’s also one of the lightest laptops in its category, weighing in at just over two and a half pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYdiaG"&gt;The ZenBook’s other primary benefit is its flexibility — you can pick your processor. The eight-core AMD model delivered excellent performance (in addition to its long-lasting battery), tearing through my daily workload and running lighter games at playable frame rates as well. Folks who might prefer the four-core Intel models are those who want to connect Thunderbolt 4 accessories (a standard not available on the AMD models) or who want to take advantage of Intel’s Quick Sync feature for video work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yD5ll"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An impressive package for its price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5kBu8K"&gt;That said, there are a couple compromises you’re making for this low price. If you put the ZenBook next to the XPS, it will be clear which one is more expensive — the ZenBook has a bit of a plasticky look and feel, with a fair amount of flex in the chassis and a floppy hinge. The lid is also quite a fingerprint magnet, which dampers the look of its otherwise-cool concentric swirl design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtSMw0"&gt;The other major differentiator is the screen resolution. While many OLED panels are 4K, the ZenBook actually has an FHD OLED display. It still looks good, but it won’t look quite as stunning as you’d see from a 4K OLED device (such as Gigabyte’s creator-focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22559671/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-price-specs-features"&gt;Aero 15 OLED&lt;/a&gt;). Oh, and there’s no headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewnotH"&gt;All in all, the ZenBook is still an impressive package for its price — but there are some potential dealbreakers. Here’s how I summed it up in my review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vfQbTi"&gt;There are some nice extra benefits (the LED numpad, the HDMI) and some drawbacks (the plastic look, the lack of headphone jack, the terrible webcam), but the screen and the processor are the stars of the show and the main considerations. While some of the drawbacks may be dealbreakers for some shoppers (they would be for me), many may see them as reasonable sacrifices in order to get this performance at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="MsgBSy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10704058"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED lid on a wooden table seen from the top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dURjdBErq8wET1b1gVuT4iDFsec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653798/mchin_20190905_4631_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a white or a dark model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ll3RxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9hMqe1"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Processor options: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel Core i7-1185G7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BPI6kN"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RAM options: &lt;/strong&gt;16GB, 32GB (only available with 1TB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5TOJea"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Storage options: &lt;/strong&gt;512GB, 1TB, 2TB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WSBKyK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dimensions and weight: &lt;/strong&gt;11.64 x 7.82 x 0.58, 2.8 lbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gb1fSb"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Battery size: &lt;/strong&gt;52Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQhcrb"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Display resolution: &lt;/strong&gt;3456 x 2160&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2aWcNI"&gt;The XPS 13 OLED is really a premium machine for customers who want the best of the best. The first thing to note is that this laptop has a 3.5K display, which delivers a truly gorgeous picture. If screen quality is important to you, you’ll probably notice a difference in the sharpness of this display over the ZenBook’s. (Though, again, the ZenBook’s still looks great and should be fine for many people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwVkts"&gt;The other big differentiator is the specs available. The XPS 13 has a Core i7-1185G7, which beat our ZenBook unit in our content creation tests. That’s what we’d hope to see, of course, given how much more expensive this laptop is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pqud8N"&gt;And, of course, Dell’s product offers some other benefits over the ZenBook. It has a 16:10 screen, which gives you a bit more vertical space. While it’s a bit heavier, it’s also significantly sturdier, and the build quality is noticeably nicer. The keyboard and touchpad are a bit better as well. It’s a small step up across the board — but the screen and the processor are the bulk of what that extra money gets you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2TOYQq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A very expensive computer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Pml9"&gt;That said, even if you’re willing to pay extra money for the XPS’s benefits, there’s one really important thing to consider: battery life. The combination of the high-resolution screen, the powerful processor, and the smaller battery gave the XPS 13 OLED some disappointing longevity issues in my testing. I was only getting about five hours from the device in my testing, which is less than half of the lifespan I got out of the ZenBook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10N2ub"&gt;So if price is no object, you still need to consider: is power or battery life more important to you? Given that the ZenBook’s options can do just fine with most of the tasks that most people need, my conclusion is that only people with pretty specific workflows who don’t need to move around that much are better off with the XPS. As I noted in my review, “If you’re someone for whom the OLED is worth the price, you probably know who you are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e6O604"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606062"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile says unauthorized access to its data occurred, not clear if customer info involved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ZDJrsxmWZ2O8LyxKR5DDk--Q10=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733189/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T Mobile data breach | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31aRzY"&gt;Following a weekend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;report that its servers had been breached&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile said Monday that unauthorized access to some of its data occurred, but it had not yet determined whether personal customer data was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0dH6o"&gt;“We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,” the company said in a news release. “This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwtto3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that a post on an underground forum claimed to be selling data stolen from T-Mobile’s servers, and that the seller of the data said it included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver’s license information related to more than 100 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3VazM"&gt;T-Mobile said Monday that it was investigating the claims, “conducting an extensive analysis alongside digital forensic experts to understand the validity of these claims, and we are coordinating with law enforcement.” The statement added that T-Mobile would communicate with customers once the company had a clearer understanding of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvpltv"&gt;T-Mobile has been the target of several data breaches in the last few years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;most recently in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. During that incident, call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers may have been exposed, but the company said at the time that it did not include more sensitive info such as names or Social Security numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows users can now manage their iCloud Passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aH7ddqUMVde7u-tV2OpUm4KrLDQ=/0x0:860x573/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733156/2021_08_16_11_16_34_Settings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN9avk"&gt;If you sync your iCloud Passwords with Windows, Apple’s new, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;dedicated iCloud Passwords app&lt;/a&gt; is going to give you some much-needed new abilities. The app, which comes with the iCloud for Windows 12.5 update, lets you search through your saved passwords, update them, add new ones, and delete login info you no longer want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTE5xN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;Apple’s documentation&lt;/a&gt; explains how to manage your iCloud Passwords using the new app, but it’s relatively straightforward. You can access the app from the Start menu, and make any changes to your passwords that you need. Those changes will then be synced to your Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-dwpODws0adrDZaDAVXCNNKrA-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786016/2021_08_16_11_18_47_iCloud_Passwords.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Passwords running on Windows 10 (note that all data included in screenshots is example data). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NIyX9i"&gt;Apple rolled out some support for iCloud Passwords on Windows earlier this year. In January, an iCloud for Windows update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22259720/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-browser-extension-released"&gt;added support for a Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; that would let you use the passwords already in your iCloud Keychain, as well as add new ones to your keychain from Chrome. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;That extension&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263118/apple-icloud-windows-password-sync-version-removed"&gt;a very rocky rollout&lt;/a&gt;, but it eventually became available to users in a somewhat working state. It’s still part of iCloud for Windows 12.5’s password management system, and the 12.5 update brings support for an Edge version of the extension as well (in theory, Chrome extensions work with Edge, but &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj?hl=en"&gt;reviews on the Chrome web store&lt;/a&gt; indicate that this wasn’t the case for iCloud Passwords). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cinlsh7quWa9LdhYGMmxPZseqW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785982/2021_08_16_11_20_37_Login_on_Twitter___Twitter.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chrome extension lets you use passwords saved in your iCloud Passwords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hfRvka"&gt;This update makes using iCloud to sync your passwords significantly more viable if you’re someone who jumps between Windows and Mac (or who uses Windows and an iPhone). Being able to see and search through a list of your saved passwords gives you more flexibility than the browser extension, and being able to manage your passwords means that you don’t have to jump to an Apple device if you want to make changes to your logins. While the new app isn’t as fully featured as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt; (or, indeed, as Keychain Access on Mac), it’s certainly better than the little-to-no management abilities Windows users had before for their iCloud Passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNDC1N"&gt;The 12.5 update for iCloud for Windows is available now, and you can get it by going to the Windows Store and searching for updates. If you don’t already &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/set-up-icloud-passwords-icw2babf5e03/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;have iCloud Password syncing set up on your Windows machine&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to enable it in iCloud Settings before you can use the password manager, but the process is relatively simple. Doing so requires an Apple account that uses two-factor authentication, along with an Apple device running iOS 14 / macOS 11 or later, which you’ll need to get the security code. You’ll also have to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0#ID0EBD=Windows_10"&gt;have Windows Hello set up&lt;/a&gt; — but don’t worry if your computer doesn’t have biometric authentication, because you can also use a PIN. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Vanguard announced, with more to be revealed in Warzone on August 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDSFjJ"&gt;Activision has officially announced &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, the next title in the hugely popular series, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYeaKjAahjA"&gt;with a short teaser video on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While the video doesn’t reveal a lot — it consists mostly of footage of four different locales that each feature a mysterious face — it seems that the game will take place during World War II, likely on the four fronts of the war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hg05y"&gt;Details are light right now, but more will be revealed about &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; at an event inside &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, the series’ take on a free-to-play battle royale shooter, on August 19th at 1:30PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;

The new game arrives as Activision Blizzard is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;being sued by the state of California&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly fostering a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researcher says he found terrorist watchlist exposed online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DceOgKn5GTbC5ZOl2PmAc6zXXmw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733096/akrales_161208_1298_A_0060_play.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHPNZz"&gt;Nearly 2 million terrorist watchlist records, including “no-fly” list indicators, were purportedly exposed online. The list was indexed across multiple search engines on July 19th, but the Department of Homeland Security did not remove it until three weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/secret-terrorist-watchlist-with-2-million-records-exposed-online/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer &lt;/em&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttYGdl"&gt;Security Discovery researcher Volodymyr “Bob” Diachenko discovered the watchlist, which appears to be the product of the Terrorist Screening Center, last month. The files were indexed by multiple search engines in an easily readable format. Records included information like full names, citizenship status, date of birth, passport numbers, and no-fly indicators. No password or separate authentication was necessary to access it, Diachenko wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/americas-secret-terrorist-watchlist-exposed-web-report-diachenko/"&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lFeAy1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I immediately reported it to Department of Homeland Security officials”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dt4K2D"&gt;“I immediately reported it to Department of Homeland Security officials, who acknowledged the incident and thanked me for my work,” Diachenko wrote. “The DHS did not provide any further official comment, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jW4ZKj"&gt;The server was indexed by search engines like Censys and ZoomEye on July 19th. Diachenko discovered the data that day and reported it to the Department of Homeland Security. It wasn’t until August 9th that the server was taken down. It’s unclear if any unauthorized users accessed the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxzKvC"&gt;The Terrorist Screening Center is a multi-agency center led by the FBI and responsible for managing the US’s terrorist watchlist. It produces a watchlist used by screening agencies like the DHS and Transportation Security Authority (TSA) to identify known or suspected terrorists attempting to enter the country by boarding aircrafts or obtaining visas. Databases like these contain extremely sensitive information related to US national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEsjfk"&gt;It’s not unusual for&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25612748"&gt; innocent people&lt;/a&gt; to be put on the FBI’s no-fly list. In 2008, NBC reported that one US airline recorded 9,000 false positives in a single day. In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/kashem-et-al-v-barr-et-al-aclu-challenge-government-no-fly-list?redirect=national-security/latif-et-al-v-holder-et-al-aclu-challenge-government-no-fly-list"&gt;filed a legal challenge&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of 10 US citizens or permanent residents who were falsely added to the no-fly list. In 2014, a court ruled that the government must notify citizens and permanent residents when they are placed on the list. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Apple rejections, FlickType gives up on popular iPhone keyboard for the blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehPF9Mv6r-SkJs0p-Rf_L-oS06g=/0x84:2016x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733034/flicktype_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Upup9"&gt;If you’re a blind or low-vision iPhone user who relies on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-watch-keyboard/id1359485719"&gt;the FlickType keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to type, I’ve got some bad news — you’re about to become a casualty of the fight between Apple and one of its staunchest critics. Developer Kosta Eleftheriou has announced that he’s discontinuing the iPhone keyboard portion of his app, and says that keyboard will automatically be removed in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZuEIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52ZqXA"&gt;You might have heard the entire app is going away, and that’s not actually true, Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;In January 2020, he added a swipe-to-type Apple Watch keyboard to FlickType that saw the app skyrocket to the number one paid app in the entire Apple App Store for a time, and that app will continue to exist and continue to contain that Apple Watch keyboard.  Eleftheriou says the app has nearly half a million downloads, but he doesn’t have a breakdown for how many of those users rely on the iPhone keyboard specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screenshot says “please enable full access for FlickType under the iOS Settings app.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNV7oi5-nRWEhBwZwSWfE_mixVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786073/13_twS_I.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple provided Eleftheriou with this screenshot “proving” the app doesn’t work without access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXfm4m"&gt;If his name sounds familiar, that’s because Eleftheriou is the same developer who’s been poking holes in Apple’s App Store image for months, pointing out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how egregious scams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;secret gambling dens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;review fraud&lt;/a&gt; keep making it through the company’s filters even though they’re pretty easy for anyone to root out. His fight became personal long before today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he sued Apple in March&lt;/a&gt; for some seemingly shady behavior, alleging that Apple erected roadblocks to his FlickType keyboard in order to convince him to sell the technology to Apple for a discount, all while scammy mobile keyboard apps flourished on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfBxvV"&gt;Now, says Eleftheriou, Apple has suddenly decided to reject FlickType yet again — and for a reason that he’s already successfully argued with them in the past. He shared the rejection letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a pretty simple dispute: Apple says the keyboard needs to work even if a user doesn’t give it “full access” to network access and other iOS features. But Eleftheriou says that if Apple actually tried to use the app, or consulted their earlier discussions, they’d see that the keyboard works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N9YGH5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried reaching out to Apple a total of 9 times last week, with no success. At this point they seem to be ignoring our attempts to contact them directly, despite previously explicitly telling us to "feel free" to contact them if we need "further clarification".&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292841676398596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqyvCH"&gt;To be clear, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html"&gt;own developer guidelines specify&lt;/a&gt; that “full access” isn’t a problem: the only dispute here is whether the app continues to work if a user turns it off — which it does, says Eleftheriou, if you turn VoiceOver on. “They’d have to try it as a VoiceOver user, something that they don’t seem to bother doing. I’ve had several rejections in the past because the reviewer didn’t know anything about VoiceOver,” Eleftheriou says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KuUMt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292843928821765"&gt;As his Twitter thread explains&lt;/a&gt;, Eleftheriou sees this as the final straw for this specific feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEntkf"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nE4HhJ"&gt;Eleftheriou stops short of accusing Apple of retaliation, in a separate chat over Twitter DM. “I can only speculate about this rejection, but I’ve recently had many more rejections I haven’t talked about yet, and them ignoring my attempts to reach them is also new,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg4tQe"&gt;“I can’t really know, but definitely feels like some kind of ‘special’ treatment going on,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnhdju"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
