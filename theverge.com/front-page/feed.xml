    <title>Foundation’s first season loses itself in its century-spanning story</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s ambitious epic takes a while to get going&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5ikwZZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s first season has officially wrapped with its season finale, which saw the first chapter of Apple TV Plus’ most ambitious show come to a conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvLslI"&gt;The epic sci-fi show, based on Isaac Asimov’s centuries-spanning series of novels, has grown far beyond its quasi-magic space math &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;from the initial episodes&lt;/a&gt;, spinning out different storylines ranging from drama in the Foundation’s newfound home of Terminus to the byzantine imperial politics of Trantor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz2Vqu"&gt;In the wake of the finale, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Chaim Gartenberg and Andrew Webster are revisiting the show to see what worked, what didn’t, and what they’re hoping to see in the already-announced second season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjnbBE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for the entire first season of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8IqBfgNL4xbz_pyw-C_hJVkafWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028213/Foundation_Photo_010904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj4K4l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m really of two minds about &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;. With the first season in the bag, I’m actually really enjoying the show as interesting, high-concept sci-fi. But the story that’s being told here is emphatically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that of &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;from the Asimov books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6O35S"&gt;I get that there’s bound to be differences in adapting a seven-book series (not counting the expanded &lt;em&gt;Empire &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Robot&lt;/em&gt; stories that Asimov later tied into a mostly cohesive whole) that was retroactively forged into books out of numerous short stories aiming to tell a story spanning 1,000 years of human history. But even with that said, after borrowing the basic premise — the Empire is going to fall and mankind will suffer 30,000 years of darkness unless something is done to cushion the dark age to 1,000 years, because “fancy math” — &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; just seems wholly uninterested in exploring that concept past the first episode or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oshlRK"&gt;The individual stories here are generally interesting on their own. The “genetic dynasty” of a succession of Lee Paces ruling the crumbling empire with an iron fist is the show’s highlight, thanks in no small part to Pace’s dynamic performances as the cloned Brother Day. And Salvor Hardin’s cat-and-mouse game on Terminus with the Anacreons is enjoyable sci-fi fare, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOpLTS"&gt;Meanwhile, the third leg of the story, the prolonged drama of Gaal’s shuttling in cryo from place to place as the show hints at her mysterious powers, is… less compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZ3O5"&gt;The practical concerns of running a multi-season TV series also clearly impact the show. Some characters, like the Cleon clones or the seemingly immortal robot Demerzel, play well into the themes of the series and help give weight to the sheer size and scale of the Empire. But by the end of the finale, it felt like the show was twisting itself in knots to keep key characters like Hardin and Gaal around through multiple eras of the show so that the actors playing them could offer some continuity for the next season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMXhWqWlb9w0hdwpkT2LE_X2gdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028228/Foundation_Photo_010605.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WQURB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not as well-versed on the source material, but I generally agree. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;Once all of the initial worldbuilding and discussion of future-predicting math was out of the way in the first few episodes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really picked up in a lot of ways. The worldbuilding remains incredible throughout. All of the many cultures and planets have a depth to them that is quite frankly astounding. That goes for the big things — like a desert planet’s incredibly detailed religious beliefs and ceremonies or the sheer scale of the landscapes you see — to the smaller moments, like the scratches on an old spacesuit or the way each culture has its own particular style of dress and armor. You can tell there was a huge budget here, and it was put to good use. (Even the special effects that seem out of place, like a certain robot skull in the finale, look amazing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyIGrI"&gt;Early on, I really struggled to identify with any of the cast. It was all setup and vanishingly little character development. As the story developed, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s confusing structure continued to make this a struggle. It jumps around &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, both in terms of the stories it’s focused on and the timeline. There’s just so much going on, and so much complexity — Harri Seldon’s plan seemed complicated at first, but the many layers (and lies) it ends up involving made it even harder to follow — that’s only compounded by the fact that many of the characters live years beyond their life span through cryo-sleep or other means. Oh, and then there are the multiple generations of the emperor, all played by the same three actors, making things even harder to follow. It also doesn’t help that the show is far too serious all the time. I get that the fate of the universe is important, but &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; could definitely use a sense of humor to lighten the mood at times and let me connect to its cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6bWJG"&gt;It wasn’t until episode eight, where Lee Pace’s emperor faces a life-threatening trek through a desert, where I felt like I was finally getting to know these characters. Up until then, the show seemed more focused on the universe as a whole than it did the individual people whose stories it’s telling. Once it slowed down, though, and allowed viewers longer and quieter moments with the cast, it really worked. And like you said, even when they don’t have much to work with, much of the cast here does great with what’s in front of them — especially the villains. Pace exudes a cold calculating menace that borders on sociopathic, while Kubbra Sait, as the grand huntress of the planet of Anacreon, is terrifyingly focused on vengeance above all else. Another highlight is T’Nia Miller as a devout religious leader who stands tall against the empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a2qcwQJzcoYaAYwl4ZEjkLBCBFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028233/Foundation_Photo_010802.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5HKnWC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll join you in praising the worldbuilding: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; always looks incredible, from claustrophobic hallways on a derelict ship to the sweeping salt deserts to the stark stone of Terminus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w31CFZ"&gt;And the slower pace and steadily built-out cast do help flesh out the latter characters a lot more than Gaal, Hari, or Raych get throughout the first two episodes. Salvor’s extended screentime means that we get to know her, the often contentious relationship she has with her parents and the Foundation’s leadership, and her romantic fling with the Han Solo-esque Hugu (Daniel MacPherson, who helps add a much-needed lightness of tone whenever he shows up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPUSIo"&gt;The show also uses the time to raise some thoughts about the idea of religion and faith versus science and human effort, and the blurred lines between them, particularly as Seldin’s elaborate plan is revealed to help establish himself as a mythological figure in the history of the Foundation. It’s these sorts of parallels that &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t quite fully dig into, although hopefully the show will continue to explore those areas in season 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jGujg"&gt;But&lt;em&gt; Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s pace and added filler also has me raising some eyebrows at the show’s future. One of the draws of the original series is how it skips through time, showing snapshots of the fall of the Empire, the rise of the Foundation as a new power, how Seldon’s predictive powers do (and occasionally don’t) manage to foresee the different shifts and changes in the galactic sphere. And on that scale, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; still feels like it’s stuck in the earliest stages of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/et-VS8rNQSXH6RtXgr7eC5TvzOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028249/Foundation_Photo_011004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U0BrNx"&gt;In theory, that could all be part of the plan: showrunner David S. Goyer apparently pitched Apple on eight seasons of the series for a total of 80 episodes, which would justify the occasionally dragged-out pace if (and it’s a big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; actually gets the time and budget to tell the other 87.5 percent of its story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWbRH1"&gt;And if &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; is going to try to forge forward in telling the story of Seldon’s 1,000-year plan, at some point it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going to have to leave some of its cast and characters behind to forge ahead in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hJIyFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, and here’s the thing: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really does feel like it’s building toward something interesting. But in these 10 episodes, it hasn’t reached that destination yet. It’s more like an extended prologue than its own story. Much like Hari Seldon’s followers, the show demands a lot of faith from viewers. In season 1, you’re investing 10 hours for the promise of a more interesting story to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The entire Ubisoft library of games is on sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gxbGmOiidEQgNvyDShFNvNFJDuI=/169x0:898x486/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170249/Affiliates_black_friday_2021_533x300.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Great deals across Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uGQyft"&gt;In case you weren’t aware, the biggest shopping holiday of the year is right around the corner. Yes, Black Friday is nearly upon us, kicking off promptly following Thanksgiving in the US, which happens on Thursday, November 25th. And while some of the best deals are yet to come (don’t worry, we’ll have you covered), we’ve collected some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; you can cash in on right now from various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22788031/google-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22547475"&gt;retailers&lt;/a&gt;. But for now, here’s what is especially alluring in the deals world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tvWqT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fblack-friday%2F%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealsNewsletter111921%20"&gt;Black Friday sale at the Ubisoft store is live&lt;/a&gt;, and there are massive savings to be had on its catalog of games. Even brand new releases like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Riders Republic&lt;/em&gt; are enjoying solid discounts during this sale that runs until the 28th of November. At Ubisoft’s online store, make sure to use the code &lt;strong&gt;BF20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to slice an extra 20 percent off your purchase. Some other standout titles include &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; for $30, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; for $20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cu9bd"&gt;However, if you’re not in the mood to fork over cash for free Ubisoft swag, you can still &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Ftom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory-%2F56c4948a88a7e300458b482a.html%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F20%2F22791348%2Fubisoft-apple-airpods-razer-keyboard-webcam-google-stadia-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&lt;/em&gt; for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jygWTr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge!","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756891/mystery-bag-gear-books-backpack-twitter-entry-giveaway-2019"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="JWnYD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875336"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2SIAt"&gt;There are currently three different models of Apple’s AirPods available for a steep discount. The stellar AirPods Pro with their wireless MagSafe charging case are currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/ref=fs_a_mdt2_us1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bJTsinOP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $190, taking $60 off the original retail price. We’ve seen slightly better deals on the previous iteration that doesn’t support MagSafe, but this is the first big price break we’ve seen for this newer model that does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e9r1lu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871605"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFUMWM"&gt;The third generation of AirPods that debuted just a month ago are already receiving discounts. Normally $180, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has these earbuds available for $175&lt;/a&gt; — not much better, we know. But the best offer is available today from Woot, &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836602-13140756?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-airpods-3rd-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which brings the price down to $170&lt;/a&gt; if you check out with your Amazon Prime membership. Neither of these discounts are particularly big, but any kind of discount on earbuds this new are rare. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="620pKc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tLLWwt"&gt;I told you we had lots of AirPods deals, right? The second-generation of Apple AirPods equipped with the wireless charging case are available for a limited time at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F20%2F22791348%2Fubisoft-apple-airpods-razer-keyboard-webcam-google-stadia-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for just $135&lt;/a&gt;, and Prime subscribers can get an extra $5 off. This discount doesn’t quite match the lowest price we’ve seen for these earbuds but is substantially cheaper than the next best deal at Walmart, which has &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the same model available for $150&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeUFHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10868668"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="oStUuI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787892/apple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sn74rk"&gt;The Razer Huntsman Mini is an excellent take on the 60-percent form factor keyboard, stripping it down to the bare essentials. This sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bI09Erkm?u1=vergenewsletter111921%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; knocks $40 off the normal MSRP and reduces the Mini with linear switches to just $90. This deal also extends to the clicky switch version which is also available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at both retailers for $80&lt;/a&gt;. If you sign in with a My Best Buy account, you can save a few more bucks off the total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uahX5X"&gt;This is the lowest price we’ve seen for this keyboard so far. The small form factor is perfect for anyone striving for that ultra-clean desk aesthetic, but the absence of arrow keys and a function row may pose some difficulty to anyone that's more accustomed to using a fully-sized keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H3Z39b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCfzUB"&gt;If you’re in need of a webcam, the Razer Kiyo Pro is a solid option available for its lowest price ever at $100. This deal at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-High-Performance/dp/B08T1MWX6J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; takes half off the regular price, while &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bJVETYB3?u1=vergenewsletter111921%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $130. The Kiyo Pro discards the small ring light from the standard model but is capable of recording FHD video at 60FPS. Another cool feature that sets this camera apart from the crowd is its ability to adjust its field of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udCKDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730624"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XIuG6"&gt;Google managed to keep the Stadia alive slightly longer than a carnival goldfish, and to celebrate, the Google Stadia Premiere Edition bundle has been discounted to just $22 at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;. This deal is pretty amazing, even if you don’t end up becoming a Stadia subscriber. This package usually costs $80, making it a bit steep for new adopters. On top of that, Stadia Pro usually costs $10 a month, though new subscribers get a free month of service that gets you access to a rotating library of free games, and discounts on titles you want to keep. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our initial thoughts on the Stadia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCCHI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736656"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GOftWP"&gt;Some other cool deals to check out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CBtmpp"&gt;The esports-inspired &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bKs2zv6m?u1=vergenewsletter111921%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is on sale for just $130&lt;/a&gt;. This $50 price reduction brings the wireless BlackShark down to the lowest price we’ve seen for this aviator-style headset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qEwJ3w"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2hic8VR4a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Iskur gaming chair&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounted by $150, bringing the price down to just $350. This price break makes this chair more affordable than anything currently offered by the leading gaming chair giant, Secretlab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V0se26"&gt;If the boom mic on your headset just isn’t cutting it anymore, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2hhpZBe0g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Seiren X is currently discounted to $60 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This reduces the regular price by $40, making it the lowest price we’ve seen for this powerful mic. Just note that the discount only extends to the black and pink colorways. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>In her Theranos fraud case, Elizabeth Holmes is speaking for herself</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From birth to the year 2006 in her first day of testimony&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N6tUok"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, her hair down and her makeup muted relative to her Theranos days, spelled her name for the court. After the prosecution rested its case in the morning, the defense called her as their third witness, about an hour before the end of the day. She wore a navy blazer with a white blouse — not one of the famous black turtlenecks has made an appearance in court during the months the case against her has dragged on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ertv5"&gt;Holmes is facing 11 counts of wire fraud from her time as founder and CEO of Theranos. Though her testimony today is the first time she’s spoken for herself, we’ve heard her voice already — in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;recordings of &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; journalist Roger Parloff&lt;/a&gt;. In those recordings, she lies confidently about her device’s capabilities. And the lies Parloff recorded were consistent with the lies her investors testified that she told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsRxqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So far Holmes hasn’t said much&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TPBiGt"&gt;I do not think I am the only person who’s wondered how she’ll explain this. Now, we are going to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QrX0n"&gt;So far Holmes hasn’t said much — we’ve learned about her education, the time she spent at Stanford, and that she dropped out to form Theranos. When her testimony ended today, we were still in 2006, well before the period the government alleges any fraud took place, which means most of the juicy stuff will have to wait until next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqw2jN"&gt;Holmes was cheerful, smiling at her attorney, Kevin Downey. She seemed relaxed and focused. Everyone I know has &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/why-did-elizabeth-holmes-use-a-fake-deep-voice.html"&gt;asked me about her voice&lt;/a&gt;. For what it’s worth, the most obnoxious part of The Voice Discourse is that most of these writers have no musical training. She is not and could never have been “baritone,” &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201510/kimberly-weisul/the-longest-game.html"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Inc&lt;/em&gt; wrote &lt;/a&gt;— she’s not even a tenor! — and the idea that she’d go up “&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerryweissman/2019/03/29/elizabeth-holmes-baritone/?sh=2e68ef644b8b"&gt;several octaves&lt;/a&gt;” when she speaks normally, as John Carreyrou writes in &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt;, suggests a “real” pitch higher than the &lt;a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/VIDEO-Kristin-Chenoweth-Discusses-Her-Distinctive-Voice-on-CONAN-20180829"&gt;speaking voice of Kristen Chenoweth&lt;/a&gt;. That is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkwwWO"&gt;Holmes sounds like a normal alto to me, though she has a habit of dropping her voice to punch words she wants to emphasize. Then, she sounds like she has a cold, or perhaps, &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/elizabeth-holmess-fake-voice-is-actually-just-stupid-ma-1833402366"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Jezebel&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;put it, like she’s using her “impression of a stupid man” voice. If it’s an affectation, it’s one she’s had so long that it’s natural to her now. In any event, most of her speech isn’t at the bottom of her range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ifiuqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The voice is part of the famous Holmes persona&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzN3yX"&gt;But the voice is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;part of the famous Holmes persona&lt;/a&gt;, which I expect we will be hearing more about in the coming days. The defense has indicated that they expect to continue questioning her all next week; if the prosecution’s cross-exam is shorter than two days, I will be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp6ymp"&gt;The story Holmes told in her testimony is well-known. She dropped out of Stanford and used the rest of the money her parents had saved from her college education, as well as some debt and some money from family friends, to found a company called Real-Time Cures. She later changed the name to Theranos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDM9yU"&gt;Originally, the idea was to create a pill or patch, one that would analyze a person’s blood, allowing for more-precise medication dosing. But people seemed more interested in a tabletop device for blood analysis, rather than a pill or patch, so she switched her focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lULKt4"&gt;She raised money from Don Lucas, an investor best known for his association with Oracle, and Larry Ellison, among others. Lucas wanted to speak to some of the pharmaceutical companies Theranos had been working with as part of his due diligence, so we were shown a 2005 email where Holmes introduced Lucas to someone she’d been working with at Pfizer. We also saw the reply: that he’d be happy to talk to Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="196Kng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We nailed this one.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="69qe1M"&gt;With the money Holmes raised, she created a device called Theranos 1.0, a photo of which was displayed for the courtroom, and which to me looked like someone had attached a thick antenna to a gray printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjTm5m"&gt;During that time, the business plan was to work with drug companies on their clinical trials. She spoke to Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Bristol Myers Squibb. Theranos signed agreements with GSK in September 2006, and with Pfizer in November 2006. The company also did demos for Novartis and Eli Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhiCXK"&gt;We were even shown an email from Holmes to the entire staff at Theranos about the Novartis demo. In the November 19, 2006 email, she wrote, “We nailed this one. You all did an incredible job in making this happen — this is the Theranos way. We are on a roll to do what we need to do next month and in ‘07.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PcfOs"&gt;We also saw a 2006 email from Holmes to Bob Grady, a partner at the Carlyle Group, when Holmes was raising money. In it, she lists people at Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis he can talk to if he wants to confirm their work with Theranos. Not all investors asked for this information, she testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="UZtLhS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I look forward to her explanation for the &lt;em&gt;remarkably consistent&lt;/em&gt; lies several people testified to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kSim4Q"&gt;And then we broke for the day. The period in which the government alleges fraud took place is still ahead of us. We know from&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt; the opening statements&lt;/a&gt; Holmes may blame Sunny Balwani, her co-defendant who is being tried separately; the defense suggested that her mistake was trusting him too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSyJDJ"&gt;She may also allege that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmes-might-claim-abusive-relationship-in-criminal-fraud-defense-11630167496"&gt;he abused her&lt;/a&gt;. In court filings unsealed in August, she alleged that he controlled what she ate, how she dressed, and all her communications. (Balwani denies this.) The abuse allegations explain why the two are being tried separately; an expert on abusive relationships, Mindy Mechanic, is on the defense’s witness  list, though she may not be called. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SxYdE"&gt;In her coming testimony, which I expect to be lengthy, I look forward to her explanation for the &lt;em&gt;remarkably consistent&lt;/em&gt; lies several people testified to — that Theranos devices were used in Afghanistan and on military helicopters, that Theranos devices could perform more than 200 tests, and that the company did not use competitors’ machines for tests. I am particularly interested in the coming cross-examination, when the government can use her extensive body of statements, including those in the press, to ask her questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="clUIXx"&gt;But right now, we’ve just heard the story of a fledgling startup — one that would not be interesting or unusual if it were not for how the company ended.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In a surprise move, Elizabeth Holmes is testifying at the Theranos fraud trial </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MKqmk"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of disgraced blood-testing company Theranos, took the stand in her own defense late Friday, in a surprise move by the defense team. Holmes is being tried on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, for allegedly misleading investors and patients about Theranos’ blood testing device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLQMHD"&gt;Holmes took the stand just after 6PM ET on Friday, to the surprise of most in the courtroom. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Liz Lopatto, who has been covering the trial, said Holmes seemed relaxed as she answered questions about her background and the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="phLMq2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;holmes has been smiling a lot on the stand. she seems relaxed. a lot of you have been asking me about her voice. it doesn’t sound that low to me? but when she punches a syllable for emphasis, she drops her pitch.&lt;/p&gt;— Elizabeth Lopatto (@mslopatto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1461838422113325060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACO7WA"&gt;Theranos was once valued at around $9 billion before investigative reporter John Carreyrou wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;expose for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that said the company wasn’t using its own device for the blood tests it was conducting, and company employees were concerned the device wasn’t accurate. After more &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports showed that the company’s tests were faulty and it &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;voided two years of results&lt;/a&gt; from its Edison blood-testing device, Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;banned from operating labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/health/theranos-shutting-down.html"&gt;Theranos dissolved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohr0Kv"&gt;The government rested its case on Friday morning, after several weeks, during which dozens of witnesses testified about Holmes and the work Theranos did. Her defense team is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646130/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud"&gt;expected to argue that Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani,&lt;/a&gt; Holmes’ ex-boyfriend and business partner at Theranos, was abusive toward her and “that any success she achieved was because of him.” Balwani is being tried separately next year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google seeks recusal probe for incoming antitrust chief over Yelp and Microsoft cases</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YI7kXl"&gt;Google sent a letter to the Department of Justice Friday requesting that the department examine whether newly confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;antitrust division head Jonathan Kanter&lt;/a&gt;, who has been a vocal critic of the search giant, should be recused from federal antitrust investigations into Google. In his new role, Kanter will lead the department’s lawsuit against Google alleging it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;a monopoly in the search and advertising markets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaicTK"&gt;Kanter has represented a number of companies in motions against Google, which the search giant argues should disqualify him. Most notably, Kanter represented Microsoft in a motion arguing against Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick, which was eventually approved by regulators and was closed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UPmdo"&gt;“Mr. Kanter’s past statements and work representing competitors who have advocated for the cases brought by the Department raise serious concerns about his ability to be impartial,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. You can read Google’s full letter to the DOJ at the bottom of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haoTal"&gt;Kanter is the latest in a string of prominent antitrust appointments from the Biden administration, which also include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Lina Khan’s confirmation&lt;/a&gt; as the chair of the Federal Trade Commission and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;Tim Wu’s role&lt;/a&gt; working on technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council. Notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576926/facebook-seeks-ftc-chair-lina-khan-refusal-antitrust-case"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; sought to force Lina Khan to recuse herself from their cases on similar grounds, although, so far, the efforts have had little result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu with Live TV is raising its price to $70 but will include the Disney Bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQ7N9gJcn19GhCLnNhCVFdNM5Bo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168419/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tO2ysq"&gt;Hulu with Live TV is getting another price hike, but the subscription will now include Disney Plus and ESPN Plus at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHwvay"&gt;Beginning December 21st, Hulu with Live TV’s monthly subscription cost will jump from its current price of $65 per month to $70 per month for its ad-supported tier. Its ad-free live TV package, meanwhile, will jump from $71 per month to $76 per month when the change goes into effect. The new pricing will apply to both new subscribers and those already paying for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMkPso"&gt;With the change, both of Hulu’s live TV packages will include ESPN Plus as well as Disney Plus, which cost $7 and $8 per month, respectively. That’s a major benefit to anyone currently paying for one or either of those services in addition to their Hulu with Live TV package. It’s less so, however, for subscribers &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; interested in Hulu with Live TV. The service last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;got a price hike&lt;/a&gt; around this same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlZaIU"&gt;Currently, that makes Hulu the most expensive among similarly priced live TV streaming services like YouTube TV and Fubo TV — both of which start at around $65 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ISMvS"&gt;Hulu’s primary streaming service sans live TV just got a price hike as well last month. The streaming service, which hosts Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362271/disney-20th-century-fox-television-tv-studio-name-rebrand"&gt;20th Television&lt;/a&gt; catalog, as well as other more adult-leaning content, now costs $7 per month (ad-supported) or $13 per month (no-ads).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just provided the perfect example of why you can’t trust App Store review scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFx2DPvClVc8nhdFNYoS9B53oYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70168316/acastro_210817_4721_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61EF7S"&gt;You pissed off people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard"&gt;by somewhat breaking your app&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re leaving angry reviews. How can you salvage your reputation? Apple just found one incredibly effective way — get listeners to submit &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; reviews by interrupting their podcast experience with an in-app prompt to submit a rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O5ANy"&gt;That’s how the Apple Podcasts app went from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700805/apple-app-store-built-in-ratings-reviews-stars"&gt;publicly embarrassing&lt;/a&gt; 1.8-star score all the way to 4.6 stars in a little over a month without any actual fixes, as developer and App Store watchdog Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s still going up: according to &lt;a href="https://appfigures.com/"&gt;AppFigures data&lt;/a&gt;, the app has been getting thousands of ratings every day since November 9th, with the vast, overwhelming majority of them issuing a 5-star score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEKI5P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;How did “Apple Podcasts” suddenly go from 1.8 to 4.6 stars? Is Apple manipulating their own app ratings now? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ"&gt;https://t.co/bSAr8sFKqQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5kJKYd54VP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5kJKYd54VP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856187595804676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLSaop"&gt;The app has made it to 4.7 stars overall as of this writing and is firmly the No. 1 App Store search result for “podcast.” It looks far more desirable to a new user than it might have before. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tJ4l36w1J8cs4Ok4ZBg5j-ulUc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028458/app_figures2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppFigures estimates 6,292 five-star ratings were submitted on November 17th alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqFVI"&gt;If you think there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, you might be right — it could definitely be that people who bother to submit reviews tend to be angry, and a lot of people who love Apple Podcasts and never bothered to look it up in the App Store (remember, it’s preinstalled!) are finally balancing things out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClRKH5"&gt;But do those people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; love Apple Podcasts? Because if you really look at the reviews, it seems like some funny business is going on. There are new, positive reviews, but they aren’t reviews of the Apple Podcasts app at all — they’re reviews of podcasts themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="omaoOF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5AtQE"&gt;I kid you not — this is the top review for Apple Podcasts on the App Store: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gjlDWMerX2-r8gik_iK5ynV0kk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028402/apple_podcasts_review.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple deems this the “Most Helpful” review of its Podcasts app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mp9WiE"&gt;Here are a few more of the “Most Recent” reviews of the Apple Podcasts app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2mG2cO"&gt;“Amazing show! Hilarious and well researched,” writes SammyAls, adding, “The dynamic is amazing, and the content is SO needed! Love this.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EjOpm8"&gt;“Mobley has Depth and Insight,” writes xbacksideslider. “Nice to listen to thoughtful and factual podcast. Far from the superficial emotional appeals to envy and self congratulating faux empathy that so dominate popular culture.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gtRf9"&gt;“The table,” says Jkimble6091. “Being a future young millionaire listening to Anthony Oneal keeps me on track during all the ups and downs of life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IdJELO"&gt;I wondered if maybe this was a common confusion with podcast apps, where listeners think they’re reviewing a podcast instead of the app itself. But no, I didn’t see that obvious pattern when I checked reviews for other top podcast apps in the App Store. Almost every review on competing apps was a review of the apps themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="095B9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pSFJU"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s using a new prompt but claims it’s nothing out of the ordinary. “With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review just like most third-party apps — using the standard Rating &amp;amp; Review prompt available to all developers,” wrote an Apple spokesperson who only agreed to comment if they were not named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJppJu"&gt;We weren’t able to track down a copy of the prompt ourselves to confirm when and where it appears or what it looks like — which seems important if people are getting confused — but it is indeed &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/"&gt;a standard feature of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, one you can even turn off if you like under Settings &amp;gt; App Store &amp;gt; In-App Ratings &amp;amp; Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6lQcf"&gt;But intentional or not, standard or not, the problem with star scores is there’s no way to tell whether they’re legitimate. We don’t know if someone pressed a five-star button because they loved the app, or thought they were rating the podcast itself, or just wanted to close the prompt as quickly as possible. We don’t know if Apple is prompting everyone, or just its most dedicated fans, or some other algorithmic subset that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017"&gt;just happened to give it an advantage&lt;/a&gt;. Some bad actors reportedly even buy star scores for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;their egregious App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s impossible for most App Store shoppers to tell. We’ve even seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;an iOS app that refuses to open unless you give it a good score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3UShJ"&gt;These are the reasons why I suggested that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;should lead the industry by killing off star ratings for good&lt;/a&gt;, among other things it could do to prove it puts people ahead of profits in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM5ZQS"&gt;But with Apple Podcasts, the company is using the same broken star score system that uplifts scammers for its own benefit as well. And it’s a crystal clear example of why you can’t trust star scores — because everyone knows this was a 1.8-star app just last month &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/"&gt;with many valid lingering complaints&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing’s fundamentally changed. It’s the exact same app today as it was then. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fn2M8A"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes a shocking lack of concern for customer data at e-commerce giant Amazon, where employees took advantage of the faulty system to look up celebrities’ purchases, among other breaches. It seems that despite Amazon’s professed customer-first mentality, company officials failed to prioritize securing its customers’ most personal information. Customer purchase histories were available to Amazon’s global customer service team, with little security or supervision to prevent the employees’ snooping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lEb6eC"&gt;One former service rep, who requested anonymity, said he remembered colleagues looking up the purchases of Kanye West and movie stars from the Avengers films, even scoping out a few dildos in a particular celebrity’s purchase log. Other staffers recalled coworkers looking up exes and girlfriends or boyfriends. “Everybody, everybody did it,” a former customer service manager says. They weren’t supposed to, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jumUo5"&gt;Eventually, accusations of employees &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;viewing seller data&lt;/a&gt; to develop Amazon’s own products prompted questions about the company’s integrity. During an antitrust hearing in 2020, former Amazon CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;Jeff Bezos insisted &lt;/a&gt;that employees don’t access that data but said he couldn’t guarantee that the policy prohibiting employees from doing so wasn’t violated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNjFiQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-failed-to-protect-your-data-investigation/"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; is a deep dive that demonstrates how your data can be at risk if a massive company mismanages internal access to it or carelessly leaves it open to outsiders. Though &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-trust-amazon-and-google-more-than-the-police-or-the-government-2020-01-14"&gt;Amazon is often ranked&lt;/a&gt; one of the most trusted companies in the world, this &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;story calls into question whether it’s worthy of that trust from its customers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NZXT introduces $800 gaming PC with no dedicated GPU</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NZXT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="07MzFQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fnews%2Fintroducing-the-nzxt-bld-foundation-pc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT has introduced&lt;/a&gt; an interesting pre-built PC for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;the age of the graphics card shortage&lt;/a&gt; — one that’s powered by a Ryzen 5600G, a CPU with a built-in GPU that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KycNI1FxIPc"&gt;can reasonably be used for gaming&lt;/a&gt;. While, in normal circumstances, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fproduct%2Ffoundation-pc-h510-edition&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT’s $800 Foundation PC&lt;/a&gt; might not be the first pick for those looking to get into PC gaming, the low availability and inflated prices of dedicated GPUs (and machines that include them) make it an interesting option for budget-minded buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An2ch2"&gt;The AMD processor / graphics card combo is the centerpiece of the build, but its other specs are also respectable: it comes with a 500GB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM. And while its 650W Bronze power supply won’t be winning any efficiency awards, it should be able to power something like an RTX 3060 if you’re able to get your hands on one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cws7-PI5Kf_72fTJ2wocAFaaM30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028365/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_12.58.32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NZXT says the machine should get reasonable frame rates at 1080p medium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nx3fwc"&gt;Of course, having a dedicated GPU would be preferable for almost any gaming scenario, which is why most vendors include one — even the GTX 1650 included with the lowest-end HP Omen can outperform the 5600G’s graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iWNbo"&gt;If you’re shopping for one of those models, though, you’ll likely have competition — they can be a gold mine for scalpers, who will sometimes “shuck” a valuable GPU from a pre-built and sell the card and now-GPU-less PC separately (the $900 Omen’s Nvidia 1650 could sell for upwards of $300 by itself on eBay). You don’t have to search for gaming PCs on eBay for very long before you run into listings for pre-builts with “NO GPU” or “without graphics card” in the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIvhsk"&gt;If you’re adventurous and know what to look for, you could potentially find a decent deal by buying one of those scalper leftovers. While the integrated graphics on modern Intel CPUs don’t match the power of the 5600G, they will let you at least use your computer until you can find a GPU. I was able to find at least a few shucked computers in the $500 to $600 range that would likely perform better than the Foundation once both were equipped with a dedicated GPU. Whether you want to support someone who likely scalped a GPU or not is really up to you — though if you do go this route, do keep in mind that the only desktop Ryzen CPUs that can be used without a dedicated graphics card &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-with-graphics"&gt;are actually APUs that have a G&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the model name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cNaBiI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Foundation’s selling point may be that you can actually buy it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XLX1G"&gt;Since you can’t separate the 5600G’s graphics card and sell it for a markup, the Foundation may not be as enticing to scalpers, potentially preventing it from winding up constantly out-of-stock like many of NZXT’s other pre-builts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKwKPN_HrD-EcdmOpshf89BcVVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028398/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_13.06.43.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The state of NZXT’s other PCs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4poZ"&gt;Some manufacturers can at least mitigate concerns of scalpers snapping up their pre-builts by giving base models low-end GPUs that aren’t particularly desirable — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2FStore%2FAMD-Ryzen-3rd-Gen-Starter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791695%2Fnzxt-foundation-gaming-pc-apu-5600g-scalpers-availibility" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iBuyPower’s AMD Ryzen 3rd Gen Starter PC&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, comes stock with a Ryzen 3600 and an Nvidia GTX 1030 (which &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-5600g-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; is a tad slower than the 5600G’s integrated graphics for most games). But that configuration is almost $300 more than the NZXT, and the CPU is going to be slower — iBuyPower will let you upgrade to a 5600G, but then your 1030 would be next to useless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98P1mL"&gt;If the 5600G’s relative uselessness to scalpers helps NZXT keep the Foundation in stock, it could be a good choice for those who don’t want to build their own PCs but who would be comfortable slotting in a graphics card at some point in the future when they’re more readily attainable again. Hopefully, it could inspire other vendors, too — while some will currently let you equip the 5600G alongside an external graphics card, that configuration likely won’t be worth fighting scalpers for.&lt;/p&gt;
