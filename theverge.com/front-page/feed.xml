  &lt;p&gt;Reflecting on 10 years of The Verge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hALGKH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is now 10 years old, which feels like both a very long time and none at all. I very clearly remember when &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; did not exist, but now we have been around for a decade and a substantial number of people think &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is a TikTok channel, such that we have now made two TikToks explaining that we also operate a website. This is good. Anything else would mean we’re already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnU9GF"&gt;Twelve of us founded &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2011 to document the messy collision of technology and culture and tell the story of the new kind of world that collision would create. And while we knew the smartphone would accelerate the ways technology and culture shape one another, we had no way of knowing that in just one decade, technology and culture would be inseparable — that everything from entertainment to politics to fashion would be intermediated by a handful of apps on phones made by a handful of companies. The speed at which we have accepted dramatic new ideas about technology as part of our everyday lives over the past decade is absolutely stunning in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNaYLo"&gt;We dreamed up &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; during the same moment in time that Instagram, Snap, and Twitch were founded. We were running a primitive version of the site called &lt;em&gt;This is My Next&lt;/em&gt; when Siri was introduced; &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; predates Alexa and the entire concept of Netflix original programming. We are older than Google Photos, Timehop, and Peloton; we launched with a glossy story on the first Nest thermostat. The very first Oculus VR prototype was shown to us in a Las Vegas parking lot. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is older than Slack; we are about as old as movies in 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9t0tKb"&gt;All of that in just 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Grbsi"&gt;We seem hardwired to forget that things didn’t always exist and to take for granted that they exist now. The entire history of recorded sound is less than 150 years old, a blip in time. You might spend entire days with headphones in your ears, awash in sound, but until the invention of the phonograph in 1877, &lt;em&gt;no one in the world had ever listened to music alone&lt;/em&gt; because listening to music required at least one other person to play an instrument for you&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program, but &lt;em&gt;she never listened to music alone&lt;/em&gt;. You simply cannot imagine her relationship to music because our technology has utterly shaped your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="d6pVkw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All these things were once new, delicate, and unproven. They were dreams.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="33Jmie"&gt;The basic camera technology in our smartphones and laptops has only existed for around 30 years; the CMOS sensor was first invented at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the 1990s. Today, almost every facet of our lives is shaped by CMOS cameras, from dating to work, from school to the social justice movement. The NASA engineers working on CMOS did not know Tinder would exist one day. They did not know that their cameras would cause a worldwide reckoning over the power of the state and how we treat one another. But here it is. Here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvlMUT"&gt;But also: all these things were once new, delicate, and unproven. They were dreams — visions unfolded from the back of the bar. Now they are &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; in ways that seem permanent and unyielding. Every year, we meet a new part of our audience that thinks &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is itself permanent and unyielding, an institution like any other. Earlier this year, an earnest young tech founder told me he’d been avidly reading &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;since we started, a very nice compliment that means he’s been reading our work since he was 15 years old. To him, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was never a fragile collection of people who’d quit their jobs all together to try and start something new; it just &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;. That founder is also a billionaire working on technology that might one day reshape all of society yet again, and if he is successful, the best outcome is that one day, people will take his work for granted as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Acihgx"&gt;10 years on, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; remains dedicated to exploring how the experience of our lives is not only shaped by technology but, in many ways, &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; by it. That point of view — and the ways we express it in our articles, our podcasts, our videos, and yes, our TikToks — did not always exist. And if we have accomplished anything over the past decade, it is demonstrating clearly that a very large audience of people is interested in seriously examining their relationship to technology and technology’s relationship to culture. The internet is real life, and real life is connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgUC38"&gt;The very best &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; stories are fundamentally about how technology makes us &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; — from the simple materialist joy of seeing a beautiful new product revealed to the complicated existential crisis caused by social network moderation. We believe deeply that understanding &lt;em&gt;how something works&lt;/em&gt; is essential to understanding &lt;em&gt;what it means&lt;/em&gt;: that knowing how a photo is made tells us something important about images in our culture. There are people making choices on both sides of every button: the people who put the buttons there and the people who push them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EEm3sj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The effort happens, and the world changes. We change.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IHUOq6"&gt;The story of technology is itself the story of human effort: the work it takes to make the phones bigger, to make the batteries last longer, the connections faster, the networks safer. Oftentimes, these efforts fail; oftentimes, the effort is organized around profit or control instead of kindness or care. But again and again, the effort happens, and the world changes. We change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV0i7y"&gt;I want to thank &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; team, past and present — the number of truly brilliant people who work or have worked on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is staggering to behold, and our newsroom has always been uniquely collaborative and prone to bursts of creativity and laughter. The number of people who’ve left &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to take leadership positions elsewhere has always been my favorite measure of success — and our alumni are not shy about holding us accountable to the standard we’ve set for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jZDsf"&gt;Most importantly, we are sincerely thankful for you, our audience — we love that our audience cares for us, pushes us, and demands ever more of us every day. The Verge is a big thing that feels small; we’re going to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBLFm3"&gt;We’re going to set off on the next 10 years with some new ideas of how to do our work better and in a more useful and comprehensive design that is soon to come. We expanded our newsroom in ambitious ways this past year, and we’ll expand again next year. We will bring &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s point of view to more podcasts, to new partnerships, and to new mediums. We will continue producing award-winning feature and investigative journalism and continue writing short blog posts about how silly our world can be. And we will continue to care about technology and science, the experiences and culture they produce, and how they are changing us over time. And yes, we will keep making TikToks about how we also have a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ngJtLZ"&gt;No matter what, we will be &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. We live in the future, because there’s nowhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Historic’ global minimum corporate tax rate formally endorsed by world leaders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XpziuuTyaszffrqAKp7-PTyc6s8=/66x0:741x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073311/G20_2021_DSC00387foto_family_2_800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;G20 leaders in Rome.&lt;/em&gt; | Source: G20&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fl5OsN"&gt;World leaders have formally agreed to an overhaul of international tax rules that would impose a new global minimum tax on business profits of 15 percent, the &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-welcomes-outcome-of-the-g20-leaders-summit.htm"&gt;Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The agreement at this year’s G20 summit in Rome is intended to curb the benefits seen by large companies that shift profits overseas to tax havens, which supporters of the deal argue has limited the amount of tax revenue countries are able to collect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfquTD"&gt;The deal also intends to update international tax rules to reflect the realities of the digital era. Rather than taxing a company where its operations are, the rules would allow countries to tax a company where its services are sold, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/us/politics/g20-global-tax-deal.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. These changes are likely to have a big impact on US tech firms’ European operations. Many such companies are headquartered in Ireland to benefit from its &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/07/ireland-poised-to-drop-125-tax-rate-in-oecd-global-pact"&gt;lower 12.5 percent tax rate&lt;/a&gt;, but sell services across the whole of the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ccwWin"&gt;&lt;q&gt;136 countries have agreed to the rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9F5Rtt"&gt;The Inclusive Framework agreement is intended to curb the decades-long decline in corporate tax rates globally. The OECD estimates that the rules, which are expected to come into effect globally in 2023, will raise an additional $150 billion in annual tax revenue. In the US specifically, the Biden administration hopes the changes will bring in $350 billion in additional tax revenue over the next ten years, the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsE1vE"&gt;In a statement, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised the “historic agreement” which she said will “end the damaging race to the bottom on corporate taxation.” 136 countries and jurisdictions which account for 94 percent of global GDP have agreed to the new rules, the OECD notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oFJKVh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This deal will remake the global economy into a more prosperous place for American business &amp;amp; workers. Rather than competing on our ability to offer lower rates, America will now compete on the skills of our people, our ideas &amp;amp; our capacity to innovate—which is a race we can win.&lt;/p&gt;— Secretary Janet Yellen (@SecYellen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SecYellen/status/1454466488946016257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYuJKv"&gt;The 15 percent tax floor will apply to corporations with revenues above €750 million (about $867 million), effectively limiting it to the world’s largest companies. If one of these companies shifts profits to a low-tax country, it’ll be forced to pay a “top-up” tax in the country where it’s headquartered, effectively forcing it to pay the difference to get up to the 15 percent minimum, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/10/30/biden-g20-global-minimum-tax/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICshxf"&gt;Although an agreement has been reached, the challenge now is for the 136 countries to implement the new rules. In the US, for example, &lt;em&gt;WaPo&lt;/em&gt; notes that laws surrounding tax treaties may need to be changed, which would require cross-party support from two thirds of senators. Critics &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxfam.org%2Fen%2Fpress-releases%2Foxfam-criticizes-lack-g20-bold-action-tackle-vaccine-inequality-climate-change-and&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F1%2F22756934%2Fg20-oecd-15-percent-global-corporate-tax-rate-havens-evasion-tech-giants" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;such as the charity Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; have also criticized the deal’s “generous carve outs” and the fact that it only applies to less than 100 companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is back online after an outage that lasted three days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roblox went down Thursday evening | Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2uNzU4"&gt;After an outage that began Thursday evening, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; finally came back online late Sunday . The company said in a tweet at about 4PM ET Sunday that it was “incrementally bringing regions back online.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JunP8"&gt;A company spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the outage “involved growth in the number of servers in our datacenters and was not due to any peak in external traffic or any particular experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMIzSz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;CEO David Baszucki &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/10/update-on-our-outage/"&gt;wrote In a blog&lt;/a&gt; post that the company would “publish a post-mortem soon,” and take steps to try to avoid the issues that caused the outage in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdisg5"&gt;“To the best of our knowledge, there has been no loss of player persistence data, and your Roblox experience should now be fully back to normal,” Baszucki wrote. “We are grateful for the patience and support of our players, developers, and partners during this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zpUUyv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Quick update as we work to get things back to normal. We are incrementally bringing regions back online.&lt;/p&gt;— Roblox (@Roblox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454900890180063238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GzdNh"&gt;The problems began October 28th around 7PM ET, when the platform first reported it was having issues, and said it was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454105518197280770"&gt;working hard to get things back to normal&lt;/a&gt;.” Some speculated that the outage was caused by a cross-promotion with Chipotle that went live about a half hour before the problems began, but the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249"&gt;company said&lt;/a&gt; the outage was “not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBqFDK"&gt;Roblox confirmed in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; late Saturday that the outage wasn’t the result of an “external intrusion,” and that it had identified an “underlying internal cause.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HMNFn"&gt;On Sunday, the company said in a tweet that it had identified the root cause of the issue and a solution, but didn’t provide any further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NWK95"&gt;It was a remarkably lengthy outage for the wildly popular game-building platform which counts more than 40 million daily users. It provided few updates during the process, going nearly 24 hours between status page updates at one point. It also likely made for a long weekend for parents; &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1949710/roblox-is-getting-kids-attention-next-stop-an-ipo/"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players are under the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5kGUP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 31st 10:58PM ET : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds comment from Roblox CEO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox was down all weekend, and not because of Chipotle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, the Roblox app seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Z93R08Jhhr70ewtLc6sU5fOvY8=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70067162/1232025961.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="akdtjY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; appears to be back online as of Sunday evening, after an outage that began on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mx2LJS"&gt;The hugely popular game-creating platform first started having issues at around 7PM ET on October 28th. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; initially said it was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454105518197280770"&gt;working hard to get things back to normal&lt;/a&gt;,” and that it had identified “the root cause as [an] internal system issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NWK95"&gt;On Sunday, the company said in a tweet that it had identified the root cause of the issue and a solution, but didn’t elaborate on what they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8WdVri"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have identified root cause and solution. We are working on getting things back online and we will keep you updated throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;— Roblox (@Roblox) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454849220012220423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wh8QEC"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; late Saturday, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; confirmed its platform wasn’t down due to an “external intrusion,” and that the company is working “around the clock” to resolve the huge outage. “We believe we have identified an underlying internal cause of the outage with no evidence of an external intrusion,” says a &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson. “We are in the process of performing the necessary engineering and maintenance work to get Roblox back up and running as soon as possible. We apologize that our community is unable to be on Roblox during this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maJP7f"&gt;Initially, some &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players speculated the outage could be related to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chipotle-to-open-virtual-restaurant-on-roblox-with-1-million-in-free-burritos-and-serve-up-5-digital-entree-offer-for-boorito-301408455.html"&gt;Chipotle promotion&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Chipotle is giving away $1 million worth of free burritos on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; as part of Halloween event in the game. The experience went live at 6:30PM ET on October 28th, just before the widespread &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; outage began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58zYa4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; was quick to reveal its issues aren’t related to the Chipotle promotion, though. “We know that this outage was not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249"&gt;says the official &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5kGUP"&gt;It was a surprisingly long outage for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, with players not being able to access the game for three days. The main &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; site went offline into a maintenance mode, and the &lt;a href="https://status.roblox.com/pages/incident/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d/617b33af51fec9053d6122a1"&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt; was only updated after more than 24 hours on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz5uDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is very popular, especially with kids — &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1949710/roblox-is-getting-kids-attention-next-stop-an-ipo/"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players are under the age of 13. More than 40 million people play it daily, and its popularity surged through 2020 during the pandemic. Millions of people have flocked to the game-creating game, app, platform, or however you want to describe it, to play games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;attend gigs&lt;/a&gt;, and even appear at awards shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking policy reportedly cost social media platforms nearly $10 billion</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODq4yfj5scuSF17cA4aH0w65c7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70072075/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hoTDKd"&gt;An investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube lost around $9.85 billion in revenue following Apple’s changes to its privacy practices. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple announced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt; that requires apps to ask permission to track users’ data. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;policy went into effect in April&lt;/a&gt;, barring apps from tracking users if they opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoOi1y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;Facebook notably criticized the move with a full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report, now we know why company leaders were so frustrated. According to the report, Facebook lost the most money “in absolute terms” when compared to other social platforms due to its massive size. Meanwhile, Snap “fared the worst as a percentage of its business” because its advertising is mainly tied to smartphones, which makes sense for a product that doesn’t have a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sje4f6"&gt;“Some of the platforms that were most impacted — but especially Facebook — have to rebuild their machinery from scratch as a result of ATT,” adtech consultant Eric Seufert told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;. “My belief is that it takes at least one year to build new infrastructure. New tools and frameworks need to be developed from scratch and tested extensively before being deployed to a high number of users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahNYi"&gt;Apple’s new policy will force social platforms and other apps to get more creative with their advertising. Whether this means focusing on Android devices or investing in Apple’s advertising business — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654121/apple-personalized-ads-ios-15-prompt-app-tracking"&gt;which nearly broke its own rules&lt;/a&gt; by quietly collecting user data in the same way third-party apps did —  they’ll have to figure out another source of revenue that doesn’t involve tracking people on their iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKAdRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5ZxYO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images show ASUS may be releasing a Surface Pro competitor that docks to an external GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ASUS Flow Z13 leak" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nr_od4N6Pe5cg0khwQkWe9rDuP4=/36x0:464x285/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70072017/asus_flow_z13_leak.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Evan Blass&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FmGAhj"&gt;ASUS may be releasing a successor to the ROG Flow X13, the convertible laptop that doubles as a gaming PC. Evan Blass (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks"&gt;@evleaks&lt;/a&gt;), a reliable leaker, tweeted out a photo of the ROG Flow Z13 — at a glance, it looks fairly similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;the new Microsoft Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wp6hc"&gt;If the leaked ROG Flow Z13 is anything like the X13, we already know how it may perform. The X13, a convertible laptop, can be connected to ASUS’ external graphics card (eGPU) called the &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/external-graphic-docks/2021-rog-xg-mobile-model/"&gt;XG Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;we found to boost the lightweight convertible’s performance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="99CsCu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;+ ROG Flow Z13 (not to be confused with Flow X13) &lt;a href="https://t.co/DLH7fmNHVt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DLH7fmNHVt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ev (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454894860096442371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="34m1Tr"&gt;The eGPU also serves as a USB dock with a number of ports, transforming the 13-inch convertible into a full-blown gaming rig. It looks like the ROG Flow Z13 can be hooked up to an eGPU in the same way, so Microsoft should probably be worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmCY1f"&gt;The ROG Flow X13 just came out this year, so it’d be interesting to see what improvements ASUS would have in store for the Z13. The image was a part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22756221/leaked-lenovo-thinkbook-image-second-screen"&gt;a series of leaks&lt;/a&gt; that also included images of the ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 and ROG wireless earbuds. There’s no additional information about any of these gadgets, and it’s unclear where the images were sourced from. ASUS may simply be gearing up for CES 2022 in January, or perhaps it’s planning a surprise product launch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Lenovo Thinkbook Plus image shows a second screen next to the keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lij-jLHaG2faF3B4De0kGsx-gT8=/36x0:464x285/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70071775/leaked_lenovo_thinkbook_plus.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A leaked image that shows a Lenovo ThinkBook Plus with a second screen next to the keyboard. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eKDXmo"&gt;Reliable tech gadget leaker Evan Blass &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks"&gt;(@evleaks)&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321?s=20"&gt;posted an image to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that showed a 17-inch Lenovo ThinkBook Plus with a second screen to the right of the keyboard. The screen looks like it is being used to draw or write on a color image on the laptop’s main screen, and appears that the computer would include a full keyboard and a large trackpad along with an extra-wide display. The image also shows what looks like a pen or drawing stylus, giving further credence to the idea that it’s meant for drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M7UZYi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Have you guys seen this yet? 17-inch ThinkBook Plus from Lenovo... &lt;a href="https://t.co/OElc5ZM3pb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OElc5ZM3pb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ev (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5VI1TD"&gt;There weren’t any further details about the image, which Blass posted as part of a thread of other leaked images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JdmWm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226031/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-2-e-ink-lid-display-ces-2021"&gt;Lenovo announced its ThinkBook Plus Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; at CES in January, which had a 12-inch E-ink panel on its lid. The company debuted the first ThinkBook Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21051340/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-e-ink-screen-price-date"&gt;at CES 2020&lt;/a&gt;, also with the E-ink display built into its lid. So does this mean Lenovo is abandoning the lid panel in favor of one built in next to the keyboard? Possibly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZBuFy"&gt;It’s not clear where the latest ThinkBook Plus images came from, but it seems likely this could be an item that Lenovo is preparing to show off at CES 2022, which begins on January 5th, although a holiday launch is also possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Wheel of Time, The Witcher, Lightyear, House of Gucci, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cewKpItAR-wkhYlwNAx5kLx4woI=/204x0:1089x590/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70071195/wheelotime.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rosamund Pike stars in The Wheel of Time | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11ZozKfRqvA&amp;amp;ab_channel=AmazonPrimeVideo" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zfaWAk"&gt;I’m close to giving up on &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;; the latest episode spends a lot of time building up to a twist that makes very little sense given the season so far. They only have three episodes left and a lot of plot to push forward. Luckily, &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; is getting good and juicy with the Roy siblings choosing sides, and I’m also getting caught up in &lt;em&gt;Maid&lt;/em&gt;, mainly because of Margaret Qualley’s strong performance as Alex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj9744"&gt;So much to watch, so little time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAZ0Mi"&gt;We’re heavy into the sci-fi and fantasy realms in this week’s roundup, but there’s a little fashion and murder-mystery as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XgKrS7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11ZozKfRqvA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="x9cdzq"&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gPYLDh"&gt;We’ve seen a few glimpses of&lt;em&gt; The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; series based on the books by Robert Jordan, but this latest trailer shows us the beginning of the story, with Moiraine Damodred of the Aes Sedai trying to figure out how to stop the Dark One. She finds five magic using people she thinks could be the key (or keys) to saving the world (whether they’re up for it or not). Rosamund Pike, Daniel Henney, Josha Stradowski, Marcus Rutherford, and Zoe Robins star in &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time,&lt;/em&gt; which drops the first episode of its eight-episode season on Amazon Prime Video November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk16bQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You can watch this trailer as a “360 experience” (I didn’t think it really added a lot here, though)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QZUAXf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WX6e6ZLNmtA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tptg94"&gt;The Witcher&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nromUq"&gt;We’ve seen a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570627/the-witcher-season-two-teaser-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;teasers&lt;/a&gt; and sneak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22462967/the-witcher-season-2-trailer-netflix-geeked-week"&gt;peeks&lt;/a&gt; and first-look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691354/witcher-season-2-blood-origin-trailer-teaser-watch-premiere-date-netflix"&gt;clips&lt;/a&gt; from the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; and now we have a full-length trailer with some juicy details about what’s next for Geralt of Rivia and company. War with the Nilfgaardian Empire is looming, along with the possible “end of days” (which Geralt scoffs at), Geralt is hunting enormous monsters, and Ciri is tapping in to her powers while Jaskier is befriending some small rodents (rats? mice? something else entirely?). Henry Cavill, Freya Allen, Anya Chalotra, Joey Batey, Anna Shaffer, and Kim Bodnia star in season 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, coming to Netflix December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JOrHoq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwPL0Md_QFQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Y3IoJ4"&gt;Lightyear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HbroDw"&gt;At last, a Pixar movie that doesn’t immediately look like it will tear the hearts out of parents (honestly, I am still traumatized by &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story 3&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; is the backstory of the “real” astronaut on whom the the Buzz Lightyear action figure from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; is based. The teaser shows what looks like a familiar space exploration adventure, with the requisite aliens and spaceships, and Chris Evans provides the hero’s voice. &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; will be released June 17th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yZ8vMx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGNnpVKxV6s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xyMnmc"&gt;House of Gucci&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rrcHc8"&gt;We have a second trailer for the movie about the Gucci family starring Lady Gaga, and of course everyone looks fabulous and beautiful, even though the “Italian” accents from the lead actors are... a little off? Based on the book by Sara Gay Forden, &lt;em&gt;House of Gucci&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Patrizia Reggiani’s marriage to Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), and her plot to hire an assassin to kill him. Jared Leto, Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, and Salma Hayek also star in &lt;em&gt;House of Gucci &lt;/em&gt;which arrives in theaters November 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uFQHhE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_h6DQWE2Mk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aBfFKD"&gt;Servant &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BF1ATL"&gt;Look, you can only show me so many long, ominous, darkly-lit hallways before the trick gets old. In its first season this show had promise (and Lauren Ambrose gives a tremendous performance as Dorothy), but by season three it defies logic (and is beyond sadistic) that Dorothy’s family would continue to hide from her the truth about what happened to her baby. Maybe they’ll finally do the ethical thing. But now, apparently, the show is more interested in the cult that nanny Leanne (the servant of the show’s title) escaped from. If you’re still hoping for an M. Night Shyamalan plot twist, you can check out season three of &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; on Apple Plus TV starting January 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldIe5z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp16VV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hMRMN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FdPIIq"&gt;Google Home, the companion app for Google’s smart home products, is changing the way users interact with photos on the app and on Nest Hub devices. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/31/google-home-photo-frame/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first noticed the changes, which include a revamped Photo Frame settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht3VAI"&gt;Now, when you use Google Home to change the displayed album while your Nest Hub is idle, you’ll see a carousel-style UI that gives you the option to choose from curated groups of photos, categorized as “Select family &amp;amp; friends,” “Recent highlights,” and “Favorites,” &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports. Scroll past that, and you’ll be able to see all the albums that you’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlov80"&gt;A preview window appears at the bottom of the page, and you can swipe through the preview carousel to see how your pictures will look when displayed on your Nest Hub. &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; also notes that the time and weather are displayed at the bottom-left corner of the preview window on iOS, but only the photo appears on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHFoEa"&gt;In addition to the new Photo Frame settings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/31/nest-hub-weather-frog-photos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also reports that the Nest Hub may be getting a new clock face option that includes the beloved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22259921/google-smart-displays-froggy-weather-frog"&gt;Weather Frog&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as Froggy, the character &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/27/google-nest-hub-weather-frog/"&gt;first became available on the Nest Hub as a display option&lt;/a&gt; that shows the time, along with an animated depiction of the current weather conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlzNSF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; found that there’s a new option in the Photo Frame menu, called Google Weather Frog, and its description on the app implies you’ll be able to display Froggy alongside weather conditions and your photos. The feature appears to be unfinished, so it remains unclear just how Froggy might interact with your photos once it’s officially released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about how online orders are burning out Chipotle workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="chipotle essays" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNjEfH-yygCiFVw-5rG6trFyIXk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70070687/Bags_All.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;To go bags, to go bags everywhere.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoIGEk"&gt;Chipotle is a pioneer of the fast assembly-line restaurant format, where you get in line and guide a human worker through the process to build your meal while you watch. It’s a foolproof system, or so I thought before I &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149"&gt;checked out this investigative story by &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealing how Chipotle is handling the growth of online orders in a pandemic world. Once I read the accounts of various Chipotle employees interviewed in the MarketWatch article, I was stunned by what they really go through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mL8JV"&gt;One employee detailed the struggle with the onslaught of online orders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8HbvAN"&gt;“People would just stare at us, angry,” he said. “Orders were coming in faster than they could be made. We would frequently see orders of 75, 80, 90 items within a 15-minute time span.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BxN2Hk"&gt;The idea that a comprehensive and option-fatigued robotic ordering system can mesh with an established real-life arrangement is proven very wrong, according to &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149"&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt;. Anecdotes from Chipotle workers describe how the company handles these complex online orders in your physical absence. For instance, what they do to your online order when they run out of steak or beans (which apparently happens often enough) is a real dilemma with a not so satisfactory official procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lYHUOw"&gt;“We’re told if we have no steak, give them chicken.” That kind of substitution has made some customers angry, and he said that at his store, “managers will step in to make sure workers don’t get yelled at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="y3tc3W"&gt;This piece not only describes what it’s like to work on the front line at Chipotle, but includes tone-deaf corporate statements, union-sponsored walk-outs (Chipotle is not yet unionized), and even burrito business stats. &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-like-being-ripped-into-two-chipotle-workers-overwhelmed-by-online-orders-and-furious-customers-11635422149"&gt;Go read this excellent article&lt;/a&gt; that shows what your burrito really costs. As for me, I’m now thinking twice before making Chipotle workers read off my unnecessarily complicated online order of half brown and half white rice with extra romaine lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;
