    <title>Bill Gates wants in on Congress’ big climate infrastructure push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The One Planet Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiyzinFBqqIhjkbDFG7FX7RDTvE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716975/1041349006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ELGvZM"&gt;The bipartisan infrastructure deal could unlock a new stream of private funding for climate tech&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;and Bill Gates wants in on the action. Gates’ climate investment fund says that if the infrastructure bill moves forward, it will match&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$1.5 billion in government funds and put that money toward projects that are developing green technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2pz1m"&gt;Breakthrough Energy, Gates’ climate fund, laid out four different uses for the money: developing green hydrogen fuels, sustainable aviation fuels, energy storage, and technologies that take carbon dioxide out of the air. It said on Twitter that the money could “fast-track” commercial demonstration projects across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJpcWj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Scale them up to a pretty gigantic level”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EBTzUR"&gt;“Critical for all these climate technologies is to get the costs down and to be able to scale them up to a pretty gigantic level,” Gates told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-pledges-1-5-billion-for-infrastructure-bills-new-climate-projects-11628769601?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/Dfa8tXxdVM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was the first to report on the announcement. “You’ll never get that scale up unless the government’s coming in with the right policies, and the right policy is exactly what’s in that infrastructure bill.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkciGN"&gt;The funding&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;depends on whether a bipartisan infrastructure package ultimately becomes law. The bill still needs to pass the House after it passed in the Senate earlier this week. The package includes $25 billion for the Department of Energy for public-private partnerships, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports. If the bill becomes law, Breakthrough Energy can apply for matching funds.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If the bill fails, Breakthrough Energy could funnel its $1.5 billion toward projects in Europe and Asia instead, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP4yXo"&gt;Breakthrough Energy tweeted that it wants to work with the Energy Department to spur up to $15 billion in investments in technologies that might be able to help the US bring its carbon dioxide emissions down to net-zero.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlGuBo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Welcomed news!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3iNZ5X"&gt;The news was met with excitement this morning from Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. “Welcomed news! This shows the private sector is ready to answer the call to combat the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatecrisis?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#climatecrisis&lt;/a&gt;,” Granholm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SecGranholm/status/1425805251345412098"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fusQrv"&gt;The Biden administration has pledged to get the US on track to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Leading climate scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that hitting that target globally could prevent some of the worst effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3IKOh"&gt;To reach net-zero, economies have to drastically slash climate pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels. Any remaining carbon dioxide emissions would have to be pulled into natural carbon sinks like forests, or captured using a still-emerging suite of technologies that scrubs it out of smokestacks or pulls it out of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WkeFUA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re talking about real money for real projects. We’ll be fast-tracking commercial demonstration projects across the country in four promising, climate-smart technologies: sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, direct air capture, and long-duration energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;— Breakthrough Energy (@Breakthrough) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Breakthrough/status/1425806066328248320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzkfwy"&gt;Both Breakthrough Energy and the Biden administration have prioritized developing so-called “direct air capture” tech. The infrastructure package includes $3.5 billion for four proposed regional hubs across the US, each with the ability to capture at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually (about as much as 120,000 US homes might generate from their energy use in a year). There’s billions more in funding in the bill to build out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;new network of pipelines and storage for captured CO2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoKDM5"&gt;There’s another $8 billion in the bipartisan infrastructure package to develop &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-02/hydrogen-plan-isn-t-very-green-under-u-s-infrastructure-deal"&gt;four regional hubs for “clean hydrogen,”&lt;/a&gt; another focus of Breakthrough Energy’s work. Hydrogen fuel releases water rather than greenhouse gases when burned and has been proposed as an alternative fuel for things like aviation and maritime shipping that are difficult to electrify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8T2Wk"&gt;There’s one big caveat: making traditional hydrogen fuel actually releases a lot of CO2, because it involves reacting steam with a fossil fuel — typically gas — to separate out the hydrogen. Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, which would provide the proposed $1.5 billion, also focuses on developing “green” hydrogen, which is made by using renewable energy to split water (electrolysis). There’s also “blue” hydrogen, which relies on technology to capture carbon from fossil-fueled processes for making the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zjTMz"&gt;All of these technologies are still in pretty early stages of development, which is why they’d need massive investments to scale up. That’s worried some progressive climate advocates who have called climate strategies that rely on capturing carbon a “&lt;a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CCS-Letter_FINAL_US-1.pdf"&gt;dangerous distraction&lt;/a&gt;” from efforts to stop using fossil fuels altogether. Breakthrough Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook are reportedly blocked in Zambia during its presidential election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N3ycU8"&gt;WhatsApp and other apps are reportedly blocked in Zambia during ongoing general elections being held in the country Thursday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/accessnow/status/1425836954264997888?s=20"&gt;digital rights organization Access Now&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/whatsapp-and-social-media-restricted-in-zambia-on-election-day-18lpLY8a"&gt;internet monitor NetBlocks&lt;/a&gt;. The block, affecting state-owned internet providers and other private networks, could be cutting off voters from a vital form of communication during a contentious election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CGd3i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lusakatimes.com/2021/08/10/government-may-shut-down-internet-during-voting-period-malupenga/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lusaka Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a local Zambian news organization, writes that officials from Zambia’s Ministry of Information and Broadcast Services considered shutting down internet access in the lead-up to election day, citing a desire to stop the spread of election misinformation. A dramatic decrease in election day internet traffic from WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1425803238423552002?s=20"&gt;spotted by NetBlocks&lt;/a&gt; seems to confirm that the government moved forward with that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gseALE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⚠️ Update: Real-time network data confirm that social media and messaging platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger are now restricted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zambia?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Zambia&lt;/a&gt; on election day in addition to the earlier WhatsApp restriction &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZambiaDecides2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ZambiaDecides2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/pTzmnesKzP"&gt;https://t.co/pTzmnesKzP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nw58eCTfu8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nw58eCTfu8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NetBlocks (@netblocks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1425817892482818059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HVmWVo"&gt;Zambia’s presidential election, pitting incumbent President Edgar Lungu against opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema, has already been marred by violence, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/zambia-election-idAFL8N2P80RH"&gt;according to reports from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a military crackdown from the current government. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zambian-president-lungu-hichilema-face-off-third-time-knife-edge-vote-2021-08-12/"&gt;Polls closed as of 12PM ET&lt;/a&gt;, but votes are still allowed to be cast for anyone still in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy95Du"&gt;Typically information promoting voters’ security and safety would be disseminated on social media and messaging apps — everything from voting wait times to instances of potential voter fraud — but now voters on affected networks in Zambia are having to turn to VPNs to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umspRx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Twitter, as well as WhatsApp and Instagram’s parent company Facebook, for comment on the blocks in Zambia. We’ll update this article if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Do we see others online as human?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqu0zp0HpWtYS--CD76H8gjGfRg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716837/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0729stills_angry.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oloOn6"&gt;I’ve often wondered if part of the reason that there is so much venom spewed on Twitter and other social media is that it’s difficult to actually recognize pieces of text on a screen as being from real, feeling human beings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jKv4q"&gt;I was nudged into this thought by a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/05/gamergate-threats-brianna-wu/"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; about Brianna Wu, who had been the target of extreme harassment several years ago during the GamerGate situation. She is apparently getting contacted by some former members of that group, who are sending apologies and regrets for their past actions. The story reminded me of something that happened to me way back when, during the days of the BBS (bulletin board system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltTZu9"&gt;Bear with me for a couple of paragraphs while I set the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vt6lli"&gt;First, for those who may not not know, BBSes were text-based online discussion groups, many of them local, that were popular before the web became dominant, mostly in the 1980s and early 1990s. (&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/"&gt;ran a story in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that gave a nice feel for what BBSes were.) I became a member and then a sysop (system administrator) of one of these NYC groups, called the Women’s BBS (or WBBS). We tried to create a place where people could have a reasonable conversation at a time when women were still seen as interlopers in many (possibly most) online spaces. While there were women-only areas in the BBS, most of the discussion groups were open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ylloQ"&gt;Naturally, we got our share of, well, jerks. Those who seemed able to at least hold some kind of discussion, however acerbic, got moved to a separate section called “The Battleground,” where anyone who liked confrontation could yell at each other to their heart’s content. The really nasty posts were just deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zwjxAe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One day, I was doing my usual rounds of the new entries and came across one such post, a collection of rather feeble obscenities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7FliGe"&gt;Which brings me (finally) to my story. One day, I was doing my usual rounds of the new entries and came across one such post, a collection of rather feeble obscenities. I was going to delete it, when I realized (from the general tone and some of the misspellings) that it was probably written by someone in their teens or even younger. So instead, I posted a reply, something like: “Do you realize that some of the women here are your age? And that some are your mom’s age? Would you say something this hurtful to your mom? Or to somebody you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80j1FN"&gt;A bit to my surprise, I got back an embarrassed reply. It turned out that the rather stilted nastiness was from a 12-year-old who hadn’t psychologically processed that the people reading his post were actual, real humans with personalities and lives. To him, they were just impersonal names on the screen, names that were associated with a movement that he had been told was ridiculous and comic-book villainous. By replying to him as a real person, I had become real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jExDs"&gt;We conversed back and forth for about an hour — about his life, about school, and other topics. At the end, I asked him to always think about who was going to read what he posted online, because they were as real as he was. I don’t know if our conversation made any difference to him in the long term. I like to think it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWVdSs"&gt;Of course, since those first baby steps of online interaction, things have changed radically. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The online universe is a far, far more complex and often frustrating place to navigate. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YNk2BnbziipcVJ5_gslIfYib6W8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22546500/VRG_4607_Social_Media_Land.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The online universe is a far, far more complex and often frustrating place to navigate. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdsSbf"&gt;Not only have services such as Facebook and Twitter made online conversation part of everyone’s lives (rather than a subset of the computer-literate), but we are no longer just exchanging text messages. And you would think that apps such as TikTok would make it obvious that the people who are sending their messages out into the world are, indeed, people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biwJLa"&gt;Or not. In my experience, videos on TikTok and YouTube seem to attract as much, if not more, vitriol as text messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrxBXn"&gt;So I went looking for answers. There have been loads of articles pointing out the psychology of online interactions and positing various theories as to why people seem to feel freer to attack others online. One, from &lt;em&gt;Mosaic Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180403-why-do-people-become-trolls-online-and-in-social-media"&gt;republished by the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, describes several behavioral experiments and posits that if you’re mean online, nobody you know in “real life” will see. Another, from KQED, describes the “&lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/education/532334/is-the-internet-making-you-meaner"&gt;online disinhibition effect&lt;/a&gt;” which says that being online lowers your inhibitions. &lt;a href="https://www.thechicagoschool.edu/insight/from-the-magazine/a-virtual-life/"&gt;And yet another&lt;/a&gt; from the Chicago School of Professional Psychology talks about how social media negatively affects our self-image by causing us to constantly compare ourselves to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsZmvQ"&gt;And those are only the first three I came across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzsvAA"&gt;Because we’re human, there are no definitive answers. Which means that when I scan Twitter, or check out the comments on TikTok, or the replies to articles, and see the way people dash off smart-ass, nasty answers to posts about tragic situations or relatively innocuous observations, I still wonder. Are they doing it just because they can? Because they had a bad day and this is one way to let off steam? Because some of us mistake insult for wit? Because by expressing disdain of some people, they are looking for the approval and support of others? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIpr9U"&gt;Or is it that, despite the photos and videos, we may still not truly see those others out there in the ether as human?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How in the world did these AMD RX 6600 XT GPUs sell at or under MSRP?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJm42NAUnka2bvoAWmLa2xPe62s=/98x0:1162x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716790/910022_amd_radeon_6600XT_angle1260x709_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qPBpRT"&gt;Every PC graphics card we’ve reviewed in months has come with a disclaimer — if you can find one &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t be able to buy it for anywhere near its MSRP. And yet somehow, we’ve stepped into a bizzaro world where a few retailers listed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;the brand-new AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT&lt;/a&gt; for at or under its $379 suggested retail price, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-rx-6600-xt-available-at-msrp/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; notes today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWDg6o"&gt;Stock appears to have run out of the US cards while I was writing this post, but the UK cards still seem to be in stock, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overclockers.co.uk%2Fsapphire-radeon-rx-6600-xt-pulse-gaming-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-graphics-card-gx-39p-sp.html%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22622066%2Famd-rx-6600-xt-sale-msrp-micro-center-379-dollars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Sapphire RX 6600 XT Pulse for £374.99 at Overclockers&lt;/a&gt; and an XFX RX 6600 XT QICK 308 for £359.99 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebuyer.com%2F1265233-xfx-radeon-rx-6600xt-8gb-qick-308-black-graphics-card-rx-66xt8lbdq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22622066%2Famd-rx-6600-xt-sale-msrp-micro-center-379-dollars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBuyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zur3Y7"&gt;The US cards included a PowerColor AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT Fighter &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/640366/AMD_Radeon_RX_6600_XT_Fighter_Dual-Fan_8GB_GDDR6_PCIe_40_Graphics_Card"&gt;for $379.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a Gigabyte RX 6600 XT Eagle with triple fan &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/640801/gigabyte-amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-eagle-overclocked-triple-fan-8gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card"&gt;for $379.99 as well&lt;/a&gt;, both at Micro Center, where you’d have needed to visit a store in person to pick one up, and they’re now listed as “limited availability.” Micro Center apparently still has three of &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/640090/powercolor-amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-hellhound-overclocked-dual-fan-8gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card"&gt;PowerColor’s Hellhound card&lt;/a&gt; for $439.99, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE6k9A"&gt;GPU prices are no longer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;as ridiculously bad as they used to be&lt;/a&gt; — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;China’s cryptocurrency crackdown&lt;/a&gt;, a flood of cards returned to the secondhand market that miners no longer needed, and GPUs no longer necessarily fetch triple their MSRP on eBay due to that and other factors. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the global chip shortage isn’t over&lt;/a&gt;, either, and it’s surprising to see any retailers or OEMs leave any amount of cash on the table during a period where GPUs continue to sell for far north of their asking price. We’re asking AMD if it did anything to stimulate the market, and we’ll let you know what we hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP3Obx"&gt;As you’ll read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;in our Radeon RX 6600 XT review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not like it’s a particularly desirable card compared to other recent powerhouses. But for $379, it’s still a steal in this market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbbtJX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsBqr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting updated snipping tool, calculator, and mail apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-lvTFfq19Hj2oW48baKxKEoRk5s=/126x0:1154x685/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716589/mail_dark_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Mail app for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FGpvzu"&gt;Microsoft is improving some of the built-in apps available in Windows 11. Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel can now test new updates to the Snipping Tool, Calculator, Mail, and Calendar apps. Some of the updates are minor, but all are designed to match the new visual style in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdnFG8"&gt;Microsoft is replacing the classic Snipping Tool and Snip &amp;amp; Sketch apps in Windows 11 with a new Snipping Tool app that combines the best features of both apps. The Win + Shift + S keyboard shortcut will be the main way to take a screenshot in Windows 11, and it will activate the snipping menu with various options for selecting what content to screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIRzk8vguuJGQD2mSOm8VAs0rd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778653/SnippingDark.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Snipping Tool now has a dark mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eD0eOM"&gt;Once a screenshot has been taken, the Snipping Tool includes edit options for cropping, annotations, and more. Microsoft is even finally adding a dark mode to the Snipping Tool, so it’ll match your Windows 11 theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmldUA"&gt;Microsoft is also updating its Mail and Calendar apps in Windows 11 to match the operating system’s new visual style. “We have added rounded corners and other adjustments to make them look and feel part of Windows 11,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/12/first-set-of-windows-app-updates-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders-for-windows-11/"&gt;says Dave Grochocki&lt;/a&gt;, a senior program manager lead for Windows inbox apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03YRSO1Lm-_VsbqzMI9rbhczTrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778655/mail_dark_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Mail app for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/otZrZD-U0rP6wcQ9TI8g7OqrqYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778657/calendar_light_crop.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Calendar app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pYR42R"&gt;The calculator app in Windows 11 is also getting some minor improvements that will let you set a separate theme to the one you’re using in the rest of Windows. Microsoft has also rewritten the calculator in C#, allowing developers to contribute to its improvements &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator"&gt;over on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIrCih"&gt;Finally, Windows 11 testers can now try out one-to-one and group audio or video calling in Microsoft Teams. You can also share your screen, just as you would in the regular Microsoft Teams app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42oH2P"&gt;These aren’t the only apps that will be updated for Windows 11. Grochocki’s blog post teases more to come as Microsoft looks to finalize Windows 11 in time for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553666/microsoft-windows-11-october-20th-release-date-hint-rumor"&gt;(likely) October release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 calculates body fat from the wrist </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yo5IKfdL11wzdk-ageD72mDI2vQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716397/BFARSACE_210810_4707_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnKqTX"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch 4 has a feature that can calculate body fat percentage and muscle mass, the company announced yesterday. It’s the latest tech company to offer a body composition feature, joining Amazon, which has a body fat percentage feature in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-study"&gt;Halo Band&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAR60v"&gt;Body fat is generally a better way to assess health than weight, but it’s often calculated using a metric called the body mass index (BMI), which is crude and inaccurate. If wearables prove accurate, they could give people a better resource to monitor their health, Diana Thomas, a mathematician who studies body weight regulation at West Point, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-study"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in June&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLcz0s"&gt;The Galaxy measures body composition using a technique called bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which sends a weak electric current through the body. It’s calculating the amount of water in the body — the signal moves more quickly through tissue that has higher percentages of water. Since fat has a higher water content than muscle, the technique can estimate how much fat is present in a person’s body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xwkick"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BIA can give an estimate of body fat, but it has limitations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HTImjw"&gt;BIA can give an estimate of body fat, but it has limitations, said Thomas in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. There isn’t a perfect one-to-one ratio between the amount of water in the body and body fat, and the amount of water in the body changes over time, she said. It can go up and down with exercise, for example, or if someone is drinking a lot of water. &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19932820.2020.1741904"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that BIA overestimated body fat if the measurement was taken right after someone drank around two cups of water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMbnXX"&gt;Most available devices that use BIA to track body composition send the current through the soles of the feet (like a smart scale) or through the palms. Samsung shrunk the sensors down to fit on the back of the watch. The company’s Healthcare Sensor Lab &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79667-3#Abs1"&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021 describing the technology. In the study, 203 people had their body composition analyzed by the watch, two other BIA devices, and a device that uses dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) — an X-ray technique that shows fat distribution through the body, which is considered the gold standard for body composition measurement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-qqlshsvZGNzQta0IieOAjT7UH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778694/Screen_Shot_2021_08_12_at_1.36.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung shrunk down the sensors used for bioelectrical impedance analysis and added them to the watch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SGvqtJ"&gt;The smartwatch was accurate compared with the DXA measurement, the analysis found. Its calculations were also slightly closer to the DXA measurement than one of the two other BIA devices. Overall, the watch appears to work as well as a smart scale based on this study, Thomas said. She still wouldn’t use it in research studies based on the information available so far — the potential error rate as calculated in the study is too large for that. “For a personal touch point, it may be okay,” she said in the email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qmPYfIZ9znnxaeTwL7nqKSuIH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778738/Screen_Shot_2021_08_12_at_1.50.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Other BIA devices, like smart scales, use larger electrodes. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pekLos"&gt;Samsung’s approach is different from the body composition analysis feature in Amazon’s Halo. First, the Halo only calculates body fat — not muscle. Its app directs users to take photos of their body, which it combines into a 3D image used to calculate body fat percentage. The system also gets an accurate measure of body fat compared with the DXA, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-study"&gt;Amazon-funded study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkXN3W"&gt;At the very least, both apps appear to work better than BMI at calculating body fat percentage. BMI is frequently used to guide medical decision-making, even though it’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/healthy-bmi-obesity-race-/2021/05/04/655390f0-ad0d-11eb-acd3-24b44a57093a_story.html"&gt;often misleading&lt;/a&gt; — which can skew the diagnosis of some conditions and perpetuate weight-based stigma in healthcare. It’s used, though, because it’s cheap and easy. Most people don’t have access to the more accurate, expensive machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O84LjU"&gt;It’ll take more research to figure out how reliable the wearables can be in a real-world setting. But they’re easy to use and relatively cheap. If they work well enough to flag trends in people’s body composition that could affect their health, they could make these health metrics more accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRnYcY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Audi’s new autonomous concept car is also sort of a Transformer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JORLXKIsQY-4fii-iE85y5EXVhs=/357x0:2124x1178/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716258/A215696_large__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aqtrs1"&gt;Audi released details of a new concept car this week called the Skysphere, a self-driving roadster that can change shape at the touch of a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJV99u"&gt;The sleek, villainous-looking convertible pairs an electric powertrain with luxury amenities for a result that even Batman would find a bit over the top. Notably, the vehicle features an adaptable wheelbase that can change size based on the driving mode, as well as a digital cockpit with a retractable steering wheel and pedals that stow away when the car drives itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gW6d30"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a more fantastical outlook on the future than some of the German automaker’s other recent concepts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7qOxsW"&gt;It’s a more fantastical outlook on the future than some of the German automaker’s other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391245/audi-a6-e-tron-concept-porsche-auto-shanghai-2021"&gt;recent concepts&lt;/a&gt;. But that doesn’t mean it’s any less achievable; at the unveiling event, Audi officials said the Skysphere represents what the company believes it can achieve, likely in the second half of this decade, as it pivots to electric and autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hs2nGa4R8hJGYwYw9FE_K15FxoE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22778501/Aug_12_2021_12_25_56.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4s0UkE"&gt;The Skysphere is expected to have a range of 500km (310 miles), can accelerate 0 to 60mph in under four seconds, and offers about 553 pound-feet of torque. That all sounds fairly normal for a concept car with a hood that splits into two panels and opens like an elevator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T18nbh"&gt;Certainly the most jaw-dropping feature is the expandable wheelbase, in which the vehicle extends an extra 10 millimeters when switching between Sports mode (4.94 meters long) and Grand Touring mode (5.19 meters). That may not seem like a lot, but it’s enough to justify Audi’s claims that you are essentially getting two vehicles in one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30SNGO"&gt;The retractable steering wheel and pedals are a popular feature in concept cars that are meant to highlight the bridge between human and automated driving. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14743922/peugeot-instinct-concept-car-mwc"&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/2/13122632/volkswagens-electric-car-id-paris-diesel-emissions"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; both released concept cars with similar stowaway controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Izx0g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10698437"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yFHrX8"&gt;It’s not clear whether regulations will allow for the sale of a car with a retractable steering wheel — though policymakers are diligently at work on refining the rules of the road to better accommodate self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiLaJQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjWHw8"&gt;It’s another day ending in -y so &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is having a new crossover event. Today, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players can complete quests in order to earn &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/free-guy-quests-in-fortnite"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; skin and emote&lt;/a&gt;. It was inevitable that &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; would get a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; crossover in some way. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is slowly gobbling up every &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608624/fortnite-street-fighter-guile-cammy-are-coming-to-fortnite"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553914/fortnite-crew-loki-release-date"&gt;pop culture&lt;/a&gt; IP known to man, so it’s only natural that the video game movie would get a piece of that action, too. After all, &lt;em&gt;Free Guy &lt;/em&gt;is the closest we’ve ever gotten to an actual &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;movie — for now. (Which is exactly the threat it sounds like.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDJOMn"&gt;The “Dude” skin is a super beef-ified version of Ryan Reynolds’ character Guy and looks like the kind of person who routinely sets off the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lunk+alarm&amp;amp;oq=lunk+alarm&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i512j0i131i433i512j0i512l4j69i60.1496j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;lunk alarm&lt;/a&gt; at Planet Fitness. Dude curiously has a blue button up shirt tattooed on one of his pectorals which, I’m told by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reporter Chaim Gartenberg (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611123/free-guy-review-ryan-reynolds-jodie-comer-video-game-movie"&gt;who reviewed Free Guy&lt;/a&gt;), has an actual Serious Lore explanation. Players can also earn the Good Guy emote, which features Ryan Reynolds’ voice saying, “Don’t have a good day, have a great day,” while the character does a little twirl that would make New Edition proud. Since the emote is voiced, developer Epic says that voice lines will be fully localized in game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIYyQc"&gt;Starting today and lasting until September 6th, finding special ATMs scattered around the world will give quests for players to complete. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players can complete quests in order to earn &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/free-guy-quests-in-fortnite"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; emote&lt;/a&gt;, while a skin goes on sale at 8PM ET tonight. Soon you too can look like the most generic dudebro ever to grace &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; since... &lt;a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Jonesy"&gt;Jonesy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon vows to protect Tracfone’s low-income users in new merger promise </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aafQny"&gt;On Thursday, Verizon announced a range of new public commitments to protect low-income consumers in connection with its proposed acquisition of Tracfone. The commitments are part of a deal with public-interest groups and communications workers unions, who have agreed to support the acquisition on the basis of today’s announcement.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpSM5T"&gt;For its part of the deal, Verizon pledges to continue to provide Tracfone’s Lifeline subsidy programs for at least three years after the merger closes. Verizon is also promising to offer a subsidized 5G program for low-income Tracfone users. According to the Communication Workers of America (CWA), over 1.7 million Tracfone customers depend on the Lifeline program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HD7hL"&gt;The CWA, Public Knowledge, and the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society had initially criticized Verizon’s proposed purchase of Tracfone, suggesting that the deal could harm Tracfone’s low-income customer base. But the groups announced Thursday that they would be withdrawing their opposition in response to the new concessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oYHWTd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These commitments ensure TracFone customers will continue to have access to Lifeline”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU9RBa"&gt;“These commitments ensure TracFone customers will continue to have access to Lifeline, an essential program for millions of families,” senior CWA researcher Brian Thorn said in a statement Thursday. “Today’s success would not have been possible without the support of our allies and an FCC interested in protecting the interests of customers over corporations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NmZ4e"&gt;Last September, Verizon announced its plan to purchase Tracfone in a deal valued at more than $6 million. The acquisition would give Verizon over 20 million new subscribers and a tighter grasp on the low-income wireless and value phone market. Verizon plans to close the deal before the end of the year, although the current status of the Federal Communications Commission’s review of the merger is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVSn87"&gt;Earlier this year, several Senate Democrats called on the FCC to add similar conditions to Verizon’s proposed merger to protect low-income subscribers. On Thursday, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA), among others, applauded the new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBZs6N"&gt;“These commitments should now be a floor and a starting place for the FCC’s review of the acquisition and negotiations with Verizon,” the senators wrote. “As important as the terms of these commitments are, the conditions must be made legally binding, vigilantly monitored, and vigorously enforced to ensure the company makes good on these promises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlmipB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The lightest folding electric bike is a costly rideable that almost does it all</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Hummingbird’s second-generation electric bike gets a lot right&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6kdB23"&gt;“The world’s lightest folding electric bike” is a claim that ostensibly ticks all the boxes for a rideable. A foldable design that makes it easy to store and carry on public transport? Check. An electric motor to take the effort out of hills? Check. A light 22.7-pound (10.3kg) construction that makes it easier to carry in and out of train stations and into your walk-up apartment? Check. The Hummingbird Folding Electric Bike Gen 2.0 has a lot going for it on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrcCp4"&gt;It’s an enviable spec list for anyone who, hypothetically, may have recently moved to a building on top of a hill, 20 minutes away from their nearest station. But they’re also specs that anyone looking for a folding bike to help with a public transit-based commute could benefit from. On a crowded train commute, no one wants to be lugging around any more weight than absolutely necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHyaSB"&gt;Hummingbird is one of three major producers of folding electric bikes based in the UK alongside Brompton and Gocycle. At £4,495 (around $6,224.50 / €5,303.36), its new e-bike is expensive, even by the standards of these high-spec folding electric bikes (Gocycle’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357905/gocycle-g4-g4i-g4i-plus-prices-folding-e-bikes-specs"&gt;recently announced range of G4 bikes&lt;/a&gt; starts at $3,999, for example, while &lt;a href="https://us.brompton.com/bikes/brompton-electric"&gt;Brompton’s starts at $3,550&lt;/a&gt;). But it’s a bike that comes so close to having it all that, for the right person, this could easily be a price worth paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hTRkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10697893"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDWCIV"&gt;The Hummingbird Folding Electric Bike Gen 2.0 (which for the sake of brevity I’ll be referring to as the Hummingbird Electric 2.0) has a similar profile to Brompton’s classic folding bikes. Yes, its frame is significantly thicker, but the combination of small, 16-inch wheels with an elongated seat post and handlebar stem means that its profile feels instantly familiar. But Hummingbird has done a better job to minimize and hide as many cables as possible. The bike’s rear motor is entirely self-contained, meaning it also houses the battery and sensors, with no need for additional cables. As such there are just two brake cables running down from the handlebars, one of which is routed internally through the frame to reach the back wheel. There’s no ugly battery pack hanging off the handlebars either. It’s a slick design, all in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EVEfQ"&gt;So too are there similarities with Brompton’s folding mechanism here. Opening one latch is enough to let the bike’s back wheel swing and fold up underneath the bike’s frame, and a second folds down the handlebars. A small plastic ridge on the end of the handlebar locks under the rear wheel mechanism to hold it in place. The seat post’s standard height adjust latch can then be used to hide its length within the frame, and the pedals are also removable if you need the extra space (I never did). Folding the bike is a painless process that you can do in under a minute with a little practice, although I found it a little more fiddly to unfold it because of how tightly the handlebars lock onto the rear wheel’s folding mechanism. Hummingbird tells me this is a problem specific to my demo bike, and that it should be less tight on production models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xjCK3v_8FnqB7QEhUxi64rDa6S0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761811/jporter_210803_4693_005.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bike’s folding process is relatively simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbsiuF"&gt;It’s an easy process, but Hummingbird’s bike doesn’t fold nearly as compactly as a Brompton. While folded, the Hummingbird Electric 2.0 measures 46 x 23 x 8 inches (117 x 60 x 20cm), compared to 23 x 22.2 x 10.6 inches (58.5 x 56.5 x 27cm) for a Brompton or 34.6 x 24.2 x 14.6 inches (83 x 61.5 x 37cm) for Gocycle’s G4. It’s small enough to fit on a moderately crowded train, but you’ll have an easier time if you stow it in an area designed for luggage. At least you don’t have to put up with the restrictions or costs associated with trying to take a full-size bike on the train — in London, for example, there are significant restrictions placed on when you can take non-folding bikes on trains and the Underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtHSTf"&gt;What Hummingbird’s electric bike lacks in space efficiency it arguably more than makes up for in portability. Its 22.7 pounds (10.3kg) is lighter than my personal (admittedly budget) full-size aluminum road bike, which is neither electric nor folding. For comparison, Gocycle’s G4 weighs 36.6lbs (16.6kg) and Brompton’s electric bike weighs upward of 36.5Ibs (16.6kg) including its battery. I had little trouble carrying Hummingbird’s bike around the London Underground on an evening when I was too inebriated to ride it home. My only complaint is that I wish it had an option to be wheeled around while folded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0P5AS"&gt;Given the focus on weight, the e-bike is pretty bare-bones as standard. There are no built-in lights, fenders, kickstand (though you can half-fold the bike to make it freestanding), bell, or a rear rack, though most can be added as optional accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3qhN34mGw_2hzlY5_QuJVtj0qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761579/jporter_210803_4693_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hummingbird’s Zehus-manufactured hub motor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rflXwocB0kruUdmQvFk3GPFj1zE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761585/jporter_210803_4693_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small wireless remote can be used to control the motor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5tJi9"&gt;The Hummingbird Electric 2.0’s electric elements are almost entirely housed within a new Zehus-manufactured rear hub motor. This motor is the only significant difference between this and Hummingbird’s first electric bike, and it offers more torque and range than the previous motor. You plug the bike’s charger into this motor directly to refill the battery, but it’s not easily removable if you want to charge it separately from the rest of the bike (which is an option for other brands like Gocycle and Brompton). Outside of this motor, the only other sign that this is an electric bike is the small, battery-powered remote attached to the handlebars, which is a far cry from the digital or LED displays found on many other e-bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VZS5A"&gt;There’s no physical button on the motor to turn the bike on, which makes starting your ride a little more complicated than some other e-bikes. But once you’ve activated the motor, it stays on for the duration of the ride. There are three options to turn it on. The simplest, and the one I ended up using for most rides, is to get up to a speed of 10km/h (around 6mph) and then backpedal three full rotations to kick the motor into life. It’s not ideal if, for example, you start your ride at the bottom of a hill which makes getting up to 10km/h on this single-speed bike a challenge, but it’s reliable without much room for error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y1McL4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are three ways to activate the bike’s motor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HjzfOa"&gt;The second method is to use the wireless remote attached to the handlebars. This process can be a little finicky, but it’s straightforward once you know what you’re doing. The easiest way is to lift the bike off the ground and start its back wheel spinning with a quick push on its pedal. This wakes up the motor, after which you can press the remote’s central button to establish a connection, and then press it &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; to start up the motor. It can feel unresponsive at first, but once you understand you need to wait for the remote to connect, it’s fairly painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4U41M"&gt;Finally, you can engage the motor by using Zehus’ companion app. Like with the remote, you’ll have to start the wheel rotating in order to wake the motor from sleep and ensure the app can discover and connect to it via Bluetooth, but once you’ve done so you can engage the motor in a couple of quick taps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rD6c9n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s an app, but you don’t have to use it for every ride&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lx74T2"&gt;I broadly don’t like having to use companion apps when it’s not strictly necessary, and thankfully the Zehus app is mostly optional. Yes, the app is used for registering the bike, and yes you’ll need it if you want to tweak the motor’s custom power setting, but you can get away without using this functionality for most day-to-day riding. I found it more convenient to use the bike’s handlebar remote to switch between power output modes, rather than using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eddMye"&gt;The one app-exclusive feature I could see being useful on a regular basis is a locking function, which applies resistance to the back wheel, making it hard to rotate. Given how light and easy-to-carry the bike is, Hummingbird doesn’t recommend relying on it to prevent a theft on its own. But it’s a nice extra bit of deterrence when paired with a more traditional lock (or two) that makes the e-bike unrideable if stolen. The Hummingbird’s thick frame means that finding a place to affix a D-lock is a bit of a challenge, so in the end I preferred to put a lock through the rear wheel’s frame whenever I needed to head into a shop for ten minutes or so. Given the bike’s $6,000 plus value, however, I’d be careful about locking it up outside for any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8vDTm63QNo3CEtTdtmCXQ4vXKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761590/jporter_210803_4693_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plant pot not included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g7MkrR"&gt;Start riding the Hummingbird Electric 2.0, and you’ll very quickly become aware of the fact that over a third of its weight (3.5kg) is concentrated in its rear hub motor. Lean back too much when you take off from a set of lights, and it’s all too easy to pop a wheelie and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH37T4ZdVj4"&gt;go full Vin Diesel&lt;/a&gt;, especially considering the bike’s relatively relaxed riding position. There was also an occasion going up a steep hill that I felt the beginnings of a wheelie coming along, so it’s definitely something you need to be aware of mid-ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hETxcD"&gt;In general, once you’re up to speed, Hummingbird’s second-generation electric bike is a real joy to ride. Despite its low center of gravity, I never had any issues with balance, nor did I find it at all twitchy to steer like I did with Brompton’s e-bike. It’s a smooth and enjoyable ride, and the amount of carbon used in its construction helps with shock absorption as much as it makes the bike incredibly lightweight. At a push, I think Gocycle’s larger wheels make for a slightly more stable ride, but Hummingbird’s design was still easy to control through London’s streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ba7i3N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The motor is quiet, but far from silent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MykA47"&gt;Hummingbird’s bike was less comfortable over long rides. During an hourlong ride across London, I started to get sore at around the half-hour mark. After 45 minutes, I was choosing to stand up when stopped at traffic lights to give my poor posterior a rest. Shorter rides than this were generally fine, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cv2Uia"&gt;The bike’s Zehus motor emits a quiet electrical whirring sound, even when in its least powerful eco mode. But it offers a smooth ramp of power as you cycle, with the gentle sensation of someone running behind you with their hand on your back offering an extra bit of assistance, and it’s happy to give you an extra push even from a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xrebTq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I got around 45km of range in my tests&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qBzK5G"&gt;Hummingbird says that its second-generation electric bike should get you around 35km of range when used in its Turbo mode, extending to up to 60km in Eco mode. In practice, I never stuck with just one mode over the course of a ride, and I think most other people would do the same. I found Eco tended to struggle on steep hills, so it made sense to use the bike’s remote to pop it into Turbo mode briefly until I was on level ground. In the end, this meant that I got a little less than 45km of range out of the bike in mixed usage. That was a combination of shorter rides to and from stations, as well as two longer rides between south and north London. I think that’s more than long enough for any single day of riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwJWGB"&gt;I was very thankful for the bike’s light weight when its battery did eventually run dry. I wouldn’t say that riding it up a steep hill with no assistance was a &lt;em&gt;pleasant&lt;/em&gt; experience, but it wasn’t bad enough that I had to get off and push. It felt a lot like riding a non-electric folding bike up a steep hill; unpleasant but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHHYRq"&gt;As a final note on battery life, Hummingbird says you should expect to get around two weeks of charge out of the bike’s handlebar remote. Unfortunately, it requires an old-fashioned Micro USB cable to charge it. It’s a little annoying having to charge two different elements of the bike, but at least you won’t have to charge the remote as frequently as the main motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHumvURs06-suejWqzRsA0fCxvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761588/jporter_210803_4693_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The handlebar clips under the bike’s frame to hold it together while folded. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqcpQLXXNUBaFCiRoU_M3TaLdug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22761589/jporter_210803_4693_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s compact, but not as compact as some other folding bikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="J4grSw"&gt;It’s hard to fault the Hummingbird Electric 2.0 by most normal measures, because clearly this is a bike that’s been designed to offer zero compromises aside from its extortionately high price. And when a bike costs over $6,000, you really do want to be aware of every tiny potential pain point before you make a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4F4fI"&gt;So yes, I would have liked for it to be possible to wheel the bike around when folded, and I’m also not a fan of having to keep both the remote and motor’s batteries charged independently. At a push, you could also argue it’d be nice to have an easily removable battery, but when you’re dealing with a folding e-bike it seems fair to assume most people will be stashing these in hallways rather than having to store them in a garage or bike stall on the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1U7iAN"&gt;But really, the only problem I have with the bike that could possibly be elevated beyond “quibble” status is its size while folded. It’s just a tad too long to be comfortable to maneuver on very packed public transit, and it’s a shame that your only option is to carry it, with no potential for wheeling it around. As lightweight as it is, it’s still taxing to carry over the long distances necessary in the London Underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mdBsKP"&gt;Aside from that, though, the Hummingbird Electric Bike Gen 2.0 ticks basically every box for urban commuters. It’s light enough to carry through a multimodal commute and has enough range to ride over longer distances when you want to skip the train entirely. If you’re spending over $6,000 on a bike, it needs to be able to do it all, and Hummingbird’s bike comes so very close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efnWwB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
