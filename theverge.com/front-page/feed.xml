    <title>New Pokémon Snap adds nighttime photography </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nun1fbOSOzNo7dAFfw9I6h8wEww=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017404/1615837328_d4d59d798fd2d99b27de4a5f878e540a.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J1oxg5"&gt;In the original &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, players were strictly daytime photographers. The game, released in 1999 for Nintendo 64, was essentially a rail shooter, but in the photography sense; players drifted slowly throughout an area while trying to take as many good pictures as they could. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294077/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-new-n64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;keeps the original game’s spirit alive but with a few welcome tweaks — including the ability to revisit locations at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzaG6c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;is set in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302971/pokemon-snap-new-gameplay-footage-nintendo-switch"&gt;Lental region&lt;/a&gt;, where players have been enlisted by a local professor to help investigate “luminous” pokémon and photograph creatures in the area. Each picture you take is judged against a variety of standards on a one to four-star scale; once your trip is over, photos are broken down by their subject. Snapping a picture of a pokémon doing something normal — like, walking around for example — is likely to net you a low score. But if you manage to capture a pokémon doing something unexpected, or reacting to something in its environment, you’ll earn a higher rating. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rao5dSO4UCE-y4TYs32D1bjYtdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389778/1615837323_555e7ae35e65172ab1246f40c1e3d73f.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TbHZvk"&gt;Composition matters, too. Photos are judged by factors like a pokémon’s pose, the direction it’s facing, framing, and more. The game includes a “resnap” option, where players can edit their photos by zooming in, adjusting brightness or focal points, and adding filters. The better the pictures, the more points you’ll get toward research levels for that area, thus helping Professor Mirror’s work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2Hynm"&gt;During a recent live stream of the game shown to press, a Nintendo representative demonstrated how players will work their way through a typical level. Players can’t control the speed of their vehicle, but they can lure pokémon out, or into different poses, with fruit. Pokémon will sometimes hide in bushes and need a little encouragement to come out. If you capture their attention, they might react with delight or surprise. Revisiting the level at night will open up those possibilities further. In addition to possibly attracting different pokémon, some may exhibit a mysterious glow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxG8Wf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;has always been about the thrill of a good shot. Its latest iteration is no different. Players won’t know what pokémon they’ll run into in different levels, though that’s sort of the point. The game will feature upward of 200 pokémon, with different environments that will attract different species; you’re more likely to find water types at the beach, for example, but not exclusively. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpGJPSafjf01q7TzKIOJOHfDI_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389780/1615837332_31d9dfe8fcfbe3a5a7d5cc48b4418685.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UnZTfM"&gt;The game is expected to feature more social options than the original, though Nintendo has yet to release more information on how those features will work. &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;launches April 30th for Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Realme 8 Pro is a £279 phone with a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ubo6dDC2rRLGJ6oq7Zg8yLLVzc8=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017408/realme_8_Pro_i.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Realme says the slogan printed on the rear panel glows in the dark.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Realme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rG6WfA"&gt;Officially launching in the UK today, the Realme 8 Pro is a budget device that’s one of the first to use the new Samsung ISOCELL HM2 108-megapixel sensor in its main camera. While similar high-res sensors have been more common in pricier phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, this chip is designed for lower-cost devices like the 8 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpxx9s"&gt;This 108-megapixel chip isn’t the same one used in the S21 Ultra or even last year’s S20 Ultra. It’s a smaller sensor — 1/1.52-inch versus 1/1.33-inch — with slightly smaller 0.7μm pixels. However, it uses the same binning approach to improve light-gathering abilities by combining neighboring pixels into a less noisy 12-megapixel image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mtIclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10409112"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k13i6x"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro offers a 6.4-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 720G processor with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery that supports 50W fast charging. The back of the device, which comes in blue and black variants, features some intense Realme branding with the company’s “Dare to Leap” slogan in large fluorescent lettering that — the company claims — glows in the dark. Realme also says the design will appeal to “a new generation of younger users,” which we’ll have to take its word for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1harqp"&gt;The 8 Pro will go on sale on March 31st in the UK for £279 (about $380).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvP5M2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nHpGB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE review: more prey than Predator</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Unfit to dethrone Asus’ Zephyrus G14&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SiIDDZ"&gt;Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is chasing after the hype that Asus built with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;last year’s excellent Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar in a few key ways: it’s a sophisticated-looking gaming laptop bordering on ultrabook territory in terms of its sleek and relatively thin design. It has a 14-inch 1080p display with a fast refresh rate and respectable graphics capabilities to top it off. Even its price hits a similar spot at $1,399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6zkWh"&gt;Asus’ latest G14 hasn’t made its way to us for review yet, so we don’t know exactly how it’ll compare to this one in all of the ways that matter. But in the meantime, Acer’s new model already has some clear advantages, like a built-in webcam and the Thunderbolt 4 port. It also achieves commendable gaming performance with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card, but don’t let the similarities (or even the few perks) trick you. Calling the new Triton 300 SE a Predator is a little bit of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L3Tknh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10408705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VQfEYM"&gt;Last year’s G14 defied my colleague Monica Chin’s expectations for what a gaming laptop could achieve when it comes to battery life. Comparatively, Acer’s new laptop isn’t nearly as long-lasting, but it’s not terrible. The Triton 300 SE has a 60Wh four-cell battery that lasts around six hours on average with relatively light usage. More on this later, but safe to say it’s considerably less than the 10-hour battery life Acer claims. You can feel confident taking the Triton 300 SE out to a cafe to do some work for a few hours. But if you intend to be out all day, or use it to do any gaming, you’ll need to bring the charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7txL7ofFfhXeuXOhVpSuEZ5KPmE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366595/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An all-metal chassis meets a rather flimsy plastic lid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4uiIVLnm9V1-B1c1FkYrhNqprE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366606/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Triton 300 SE looks very sharp for a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYH53O"&gt;Whether limited battery life bothers you or not, there are some other issues that I couldn’t help but notice. The interplay of all-plastic on the lid and an all-metal chassis looks fine, but the lid feels flimsy in a way that makes me concerned for its longevity. Applying just a few pounds of pressure to the Predator logo beneath the display makes it bow more than it should. On the unit that Acer sent us, the softer plastic built into the screen’s bezel that cushions the lid when it closes has tiny gaps where it’s not seamlessly adhered. And near the keyboard, the “Turbo” key that amps up the fans has a slight imperfection on it. Lastly, Acer stuffed &lt;em&gt;far &lt;/em&gt;too much annoying bloatware into the Triton. About every hour, there’s a pop-up asking me to install or subscribe to something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLXpfW"&gt;All of this makes for a laptop that doesn’t feel as high-end as its cost indicates it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6HQ8j"&gt;There’s just one configuration of this model right now, containing a four-core Intel Core i7-11375H processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, as well as the aforementioned RTX 3060 graphics card. The performance of that GPU depends a lot on how much power each manufacturer wants to allow it to draw. And in this case, it has a 75W maximum power draw and can be boosted up to 1,382MHz. After spending time with several RTX 3070-equipped gaming laptops with more headroom than that, I wasn’t expecting much here. However, I was pleased to see gaming performance in multiple titles getting around 60 frames per second without requiring compromises in the settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ODnpn7hQK4qWQ1-eXOJGrlhqTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366601/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This photo highlights the color-shifting hinge as well as the display’s poor viewing angles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zM84qkWQm637K2k98o62Dkd6CRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366598/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viewed straight-on, the 14-inch 1080p 144Hz display looks fantastic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTqtJ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, a system-intensive, open-world game, ran at an average of 60fps with ultra settings turned on. Testing Triton 300 SE’s RTX-enabled ray-tracing chops, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; on ultra settings with the ray-tracing shadows set to medium got 61 frames per second. Turning the ray-tracing setting up to ultra knocked it down to 48fps. Running that game with ray tracing set to ultra and Nvidia’s deep learning super sampling (DLSS) technique turned on that lowers the render resolution, then uses AI to upscale textures, Acer’s laptop achieved 55 frames per second, splitting the difference. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;, another demanding open-world game, ran at 53 frames per second on ultra settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="WJUU87"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10408809"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIww1C"&gt;It’s not surprising that, with its newer components, Acer’s laptop puts up more favorable numbers than the 2020 G14 that had an RTX 2060. Performance &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-series/spec"&gt;in some of Asus’ 2021 models&lt;/a&gt; could fare &lt;em&gt;slightly &lt;/em&gt;better in terms of 1080p performance, even though it similarly uses the RTX 3060. That’s because its graphics chip has a slightly higher 80W power ceiling compared to 75W in the Triton 300 SE, not to mention that its AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor has eight cores compared to the four cores with this 11th Gen Intel processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhek5O"&gt;The Triton 300 SE’s metal chassis effectively turns into a heatsink to dissipate heat under heavy use, and I noticed it getting warm during gameplay. Unlike most laptops, the heat extended all the way down to the wrist rest, but it wasn’t bothersome. I appreciate the thought that went into the cooling system, which takes air in through the back, then pushes it out the sides of the laptop. Some laptops do the inverse of this, and it can make actually using laptops on your lap a little too toasty, even for non-gaming-related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUotwm"&gt;There’s a “Turbo” button located above the main batch of keys that overclocks the CPU and GPU, sending the fans loudly into overdrive. I didn’t need to use this mode to achieve the frame rates I cited earlier, and turning it on didn’t seem to make a huge difference during my testing. I also didn’t notice an appreciable difference using it with Adobe Premiere Pro to export a 5-minute, 33-second 4K video. It took 5 minutes and 40 seconds to run through the test. Considering the price and size of this machine, these results rank highly among other laptops we’ve tested recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHho7z"&gt;Acer uses a 14-inch 1080p IPS 16:9 aspect ratio panel with a 144Hz refresh rate with up to 300 nits of brightness. During general use and gameplay, I have no complaints about the color accuracy or brightness, though there’s some noticeable ghosting, likely attributed to a higher response time that adds latency. As a result, the mouse pointer doesn’t glide across the screen as smoothly as I’ve seen on other high refresh rate screens, and it extends to gameplay looking a little blurry at times, trivializing the technical achievement of hitting 60 frames per second in games, as well as having a 144Hz refresh rate in the first place. Despite multiple requests for a comment on the response time, Acer didn’t provide the spec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-1yJbJMt4WaJObvinZocpj9phE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366602/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I felt right at home on Acer’s keyboard layout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YdxhepQO46sf51KYN7WQdkWJ4cw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366603/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This fingerprint sensor worked about half the time for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTdi99"&gt;Additionally, this screen’s viewing angles are far more limited than I expect from an IPS panel. It’s easily viewable straight-on, but less so from other angles unless the brightness is amped up. Next to the less-than-stellar battery life, this is a big miss for Acer that might be less forgivable for gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrtDHs"&gt;I was right at home with Acer’s keyboard, though, both in terms of the layout and feel of the keys here. This keyboard has three-zone backlit keys (you can customize each zone to be a different color in its Predator software), and though many features require holding the “Fn” key to use, the layout is intuitive and doesn’t feel overly cramped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ2dOX"&gt;The glass trackpad supports all of the gestures I expect with Windows Precision drivers, but it isn’t as responsive to my touch as it should be. I think it’s more an issue with the screen’s response time than it is an issue with the trackpad. A fingerprint scanner you can use as an alternative to a PIN is embedded in the top-left corner of the trackpad, but I’ve found that it only works half the time. With that failure rate, I’d rather just have more trackpad real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="kGPMhM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10408691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msGm1x"&gt;Acer included the essentials in terms of ports. There are two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports — one on each side, with the right-facing port being able to charge some devices. The star of the show is the Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port, which can be used to transfer data or connect a display. Additionally, I’m happy to see an HDMI 2.1 port, offering up to 4K resolution at 120 frames per second. There’s also a headphone combo jack and a DC-in port for its relatively compact 180W power brick. I wish Acer allowed this laptop to be recharged via USB-C, but it’s all handled through the proprietary DC charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ne6Mgh6TuUgwDpOAIbsDsbJkUc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366605/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The left side features a fan exhaust, charging port, USB Type-A port, and a Thunderbolt 4 port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hd4TgyzJZSlY6ufOgeDabHI9Iuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366604/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right, there’s another fan exhaust, HDMI 2.1 port, USB Type-A, and a headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6SxMdo"&gt;Coming back to battery life, it’s not the biggest flaw that this laptop can only get between five and six hours of battery life per charge while using apps like Microsoft Edge, Spotify, and Slack. The issue here is that Acer claims it will last up to 10 hours, but it doesn’t outwardly mention that you’ll only get that kind of longevity if you’re doing something very simple, like watching HD video with no other apps running. That’s fine if you’re on an airplane for hours on end, but most people rely on a laptop for more than that, so it’s far from the best method for judging battery performance. Based on my testing, the best results you should expect with light usage is about six hours at most. It’s not bad for a gaming laptop, but it keeps the Triton 300 SE from hanging with the battery performance you can get from other ultrabooks or even the Zephyrus G14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="h5edCU"&gt;It was daring of Acer to jump into the ring against Asus’ Zephyrus G14, a gaming laptop that ticks a lot of boxes (aside from the missing webcam) for the price. This is a more elegant-looking machine than the G14, and compared directly, it’s hard to not appreciate its Thunderbolt 4 port and a webcam. It’s also a capable performer with games. But Asus proved that a gaming laptop can be more than just a powerful machine. It can also have good battery life for portable use and competent build quality without a bunch of bloatware. The competition is fierce, but the Triton 300 SE is more like prey than a bonafide Predator.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dota: Dragon’s Blood on Netflix fails to show what makes Dota 2 special</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpbTUZh-mQVerbnBgXJpzVYvoAo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017242/DT1_108_251_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7IFKa"&gt;Competitive games like &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; are absolutely dripping with lore. While they might not tell a story in the traditional sense, they have surprisingly robust fantasy worlds. Usually, you can only catch this in brief snippets through flavor text or character bios. But increasingly, game studios are attempting to build on these fictional worlds through more traditional storytelling, whether it’s comics, short stories, or TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urjPgK"&gt;The latest example is &lt;em&gt;Dota: Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix, which fleshes out the world of Valve’s long-running &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; via an eight-episode anime. The good news is that it’s a fun, albeit brief, fantasy romp you can enjoy even if you haven’t played the game. The bad news is that it does very little to explain what makes the world of &lt;em&gt;Dota&lt;/em&gt; interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IWYpt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This review includes some spoilers for the early episodes of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragon’s Blood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1dptS7Txm-563YAuVqt6Dj2u-wQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392051/DT1_102_388_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CTmIEN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt; follows the paths of a few different characters, starting with Davion, a dragon knight helping a small town rid itself of some dangerous monsters. Early on, after a strange run-in with an elder dragon, he becomes possessed by a demonic force that occasionally causes him to inconveniently turn into a flesh-hungry dragon himself. Soon after that, he teams up with a disgraced princess named Mirana — who rides a giant cat — on a quest to cure himself and also prevent a war of some kind. There are also elves in search of magical lotus flowers, a goddess desperate to be worshipped, and a handful of other story arcs covering everything from warring elven factions to crazed monsters to the brief appearance of zombies. Oh, and an evil talking sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qjU8Y"&gt;Really, there’s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; happening, but the show moves at a brisk pace and never settles on a thread for too long. As is common in fantasy stories, there are a few groups with different goals, all seemingly rushing toward each other. But you rarely get to see those threads interact in interesting ways. Just describing the plot is difficult: there are people trying to stop a war, but some of the key elements — like those magic flowers that characters risk their lives for — are never really explained. It’s almost never clear why things that are deemed important actually matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9mtb2"&gt;There are some things the show does well. Most notably, it’s full of great action sequences — the animation was handled by Studio Mir, best known for its work on &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt; — with lots of cool special powers and dangerous-looking dragons. You don’t have to understand &lt;em&gt;Dota&lt;/em&gt; lore to enjoy a well-choreographed battle between a superpowered knight and the dragon he’s been hunting for decades. The action is fast and fluid, and &lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt; makes great use of scale and spectacle, with a number of big battles and chase sequences. I should note, however, that things can get pretty graphic. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; adaptation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt; is full of blood and gore, with lots of decapitations and even one sequence where a dragon is butchered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_1OK22haYQ6Hx-CocSujMAjbls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392052/DT1_102_036_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuAcJ5"&gt;Essentially, the show is eye candy, quickly jumping from one action-heavy sequence to the next. It looks incredible, but since it’s only eight episodes, this fast pace means it never has the time to fully develop its characters or world. Even worse, &lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt; never does anything to make &lt;em&gt;Dota&lt;/em&gt; stand out from the many other fantasy stories out there. I love ancient dragons and stealthy elf warriors as much as anyone, but they’re not exactly new territory. What is it that makes &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s universe interesting? As someone who watched the show but hasn’t played the game, I couldn’t tell you. I know it’s a franchise that has an incredibly devoted fan base, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2014/9/29/6862757/dota-2-the-1000-hour-review"&gt;some who have played for thousands of hours&lt;/a&gt;. But the show reduces it to a bunch of great action sequences covering a generic fantasy story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ep9iST"&gt;Maybe things will change in a second season now that the main cast has been introduced and the magical MacGuffins have been revealed. But after eight episodes, I can’t say I’m any more interested in playing a few rounds of &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; than I was before. &lt;em&gt;Dragon’s Blood&lt;/em&gt; is smart in that it doesn’t assume the viewer has much knowledge of the franchise. Unfortunately, it never inspired me to dig deeper, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wckb3I"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dota: Dragon’s Blood &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;airs on Netflix starting on March 25th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack now lets you DM anyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VLKBoJBRkqgDTLvNdIhufrKYGvI=/102x0:1280x785/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017238/jITWZ6H.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P9q92D"&gt;Slack is starting to roll out a new feature that lets anyone using the service DM each other. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505548/slack-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature"&gt;Announced back in October&lt;/a&gt;, Slack Connect DMs will let Slack users privately message employees outside of their company. It’s designed for companies working with partners or clients, but you could even use it to message friends at other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnsrGq"&gt;This new DM feature builds on Slack’s work with Connect, which started appearing last year. Slack Connect is primarily designed to let businesses collaborate together through shared channels, and cross-organizational DMs is the next big part of Connect. DMs work by sending a special link to start a conversation and may require Slack admin approval depending on how your organization has set up Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz6SrK"&gt;Paid Slack users will be able to access Slack Connect DMs today, and the company says it plans to roll this out to all teams, including free users, soon. Slack is also working on a &lt;a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/transformation/the-next-step-in-reinventing-business-communication-with-slack-connect"&gt;new way to link&lt;/a&gt; together multiple organizations to create a private business network. This feature will launch later this year and include unified directories, channel discovery, and shared apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supreme’s next drop could be its flashiest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zcK_nSCHubvdKxT6lY4MK6f9A6Q=/0x0:3300x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016774/c2fiyjWOS8E1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Supreme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DgAnaU"&gt;Supreme, the streetwear brand notorious for slapping its name on everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/8/19/20811879/supreme-phone-blu-3g-burner-feature-logo-specs-price-release"&gt;feature phones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/30/red-clay-brick-selling-for-up-to-1000-on-ebay"&gt;a literal brick&lt;/a&gt;, is turning its attention to film photography. Tomorrow’s drop includes a &lt;a href="https://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer2021/accessories/supreme-yashica-mf-1-camera"&gt;reusable Yashica MF-1 35mm film camera&lt;/a&gt;, available in either black or red and subtly adorned with a Supreme logo. It’s made of plastic, which isn’t particularly flashy, but it’s also got a built-in flash, which is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZfO9g"&gt;Like many of Supreme’s other branded accessories, there’s nothing particularly special about the camera this is based on. This specific model appears to have its origins as &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1940283777/yashica-absolute-premiere/description"&gt;a 2019 Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;, and reviews have generally been mixed. “Neither totally awful but not that great,” was &lt;a href="https://austerityphoto.co.uk/reloading-in-the-disposable-world-the-new-yashica-mf-1-review/"&gt;one blog’s conclusion&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.jamescockroft.com/20190916/photography/yashica-mf-1-first-roll-review/"&gt;another more negative review&lt;/a&gt; called it “perhaps the objectively worst camera I’ve ever used,” adding that a disposable camera would deliver better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PkHbsk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Supreme released instant film last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BjJKLd"&gt;This isn’t Supreme’s first foray into film photography. Last year, it partnered with Fujifilm to release &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/design/what-will-you-shoot-with-your-supreme-branded-instant-film"&gt;Supreme-branded instant film&lt;/a&gt; for its Instax cameras. This time around, however, it looks like aspiring hypebeasts will have to supply their own film for Supreme’s camera, rather than their own camera for Supreme’s film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYkRQz"&gt;Still, if you’re interested in giving film photography a spin, then &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/style/supreme-yashica-mf-1-35mm-film-camera-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;InputMag &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; the camera should be available at around 11AM ET on March 25th from Supreme’s physical and online stores for a little over $60. If past experience is anything to go by, expect the cameras to sell out relatively quickly, only to appear on the second-hand market at much more questionable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon delivery drivers have to consent to AI surveillance in their vans or lose their jobs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A driver of Amazon prime prepares for delivery in London..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rusE645bFOVQYeT-yEvx5X4fRrQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016516/1230412848.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dinendra Haria/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4w1V2"&gt;Amazon is well-known for its technological Taylorism: using digital sensors to monitor and control the activity of its workers in the name of efficiency. But after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;installing machine learning-powered surveillance cameras&lt;/a&gt; in its delivery vans earlier this year, the company is now telling employees: agree to be surveilled by AI or lose your job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dUVlc"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8n3j/amazon-delivery-drivers-forced-to-sign-biometric-consent-form-or-lose-job"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon delivery drivers in the US now have to sign “biometric consent” forms to continue working for the retailing giant. Exactly what information is being collected seems to vary based on what surveillance equipment has been installed in any given van, but Amazon’s privacy policy (embedded below) covers a wide range of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CESTHR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data includes vehicle location, speed, “potential traffic violations,” and more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZsE8x"&gt;The data that drivers must consent to be collected includes photographs used to verify their identity; vehicle location and movements (including “miles driven, speed, acceleration, braking, turns, following distance”); “potential traffic violations” (like speeding, failure to stop at stop signs, and undone seatbelts); and “potentially risky driver behavior, such as distracted driving or drowsy driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XGQQri"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20521478-amazonprivacypolicyforvehiclecameratechnology/?embed=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Amazon+Privacy+Policy+for+Vehicle+Camera+Technology (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IzH1e"&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s this last point that seems to be the most contentious. In February, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would start installing AI-powered cameras built by tech firm Netradyne in its delivery vans. These cameras record “100% of the time” and are supposed to identify dangerous behavior, like if a driver is yawning or checking their phone. The systems can then provide real-time feedback, telling a driver to take a break or keep their eyes on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sIBNq"&gt;This level of micro-management — and the potential for the AI systems to get it wrong — seems to have angered some drivers. One driver speaking to the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/global-tech-privacy-idUSL8N2KB4D5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thomson Reuters Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month said the cameras were an “invasion of privacy.” “We are out here working all day, trying our best already,” the driver, 22-year-old Henry Search, told the publication. “The cameras are just another way to control us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ov2G"&gt;Other drivers have simply refused to sign, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8n3j/amazon-delivery-drivers-forced-to-sign-biometric-consent-form-or-lose-job"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a heart-breaking conversation when someone tells you that you’re their favorite person they have ever worked for, but Amazon just micromanages them too much,” the owner of one Amazon delivery company told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL1Ncl"&gt;When news of the cameras’ installation was announced earlier this year, Amazon defended the technology as a boon for safety. “We are investing in safety across our operations and recently started rolling out industry leading camera-based safety technology across our delivery fleet,” an Amazon spokesperson told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFY6jD"&gt;Previously, Amazon’s deployment of this sort of technology has mostly focused on its &lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/02/amazon-wristband-surveillance-scientific-management"&gt;warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt;, where “pickers” have to fulfill orders while being timed by handheld scanners. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16958918/amazon-patents-trackable-wristband-warehouse-employees"&gt;patented&lt;/a&gt; wristbands that even track workers’ hands in real-time, using haptic feedback to nudge them when they reach for an incorrect item. And it recently expanded its use of opt-in “gamification” techniques that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331502/amazon-warehouse-gamification-program-expand-fc-games"&gt;hustle workers&lt;/a&gt; into ever greater efforts in exchange for digital rewards. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime adds features to make scooter-sharing less stressful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwSltqQwz-s3Ierb6lqK6KbEc1I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016393/akrales_190321_3312_0048.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAgdnj"&gt;Scooter-sharing giant Lime is updating its app to make renting one of the company’s battery-powered two-wheelers a little easier. Customers can now take advantage of new features like app-less riding, 10-minute reservations, and vehicle configurations to take some of the bite out of scooter-sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dV2g8J"&gt;Customers who don’t have the Lime app on their phone can still ride by taking a photo of the scooter’s QR code and paying through Apple Pay or Google Pay. Lime says it will be a useful tool for first-time riders who don’t want to commit or don’t have space on their phones. The functionality works by temporarily downloading a portion of Lime’s normal app. It uses the Instant Apps feature on Android, while on iPhones it makes use of the new App Clips feature, which arrived last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21299924/ios-14-iphone-wwdc-2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity"&gt;as part of iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v6wV7L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reservations could be a potential boon to anyone who has lost a scooter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tM5wPg"&gt;Reservations could be a potential boon to anyone who has thought to rent a nearby scooter, only to find it gone by the time they arrive at its purported location. After testing out the feature in a couple of key markets, Lime will now allow customers to reserve a scooter for 10 minutes in an effort to take some of the stress out of scooter riding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36YLuc"&gt;Lime will also start recommending certain vehicles to its customers. So when you open the app, the company will refer you to the nearest vehicle with the best battery range. Combined with the reservation feature, Lime thinks this will help customers secure their vehicle faster, estimating it will take “less than 5 seconds” to reserve a scooter after opening the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSzV1U"&gt;And finally, Lime’s app is getting a dark mode to help customers see their options better while riding at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLMm4J"&gt;Lime, which operates in 120 cities across five continents, is in growth mode as the weather warms up in certain key markets. In addition to adding new products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; and pouring money into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303364/lime-ebike-expansion-new-cities-50-million-investment"&gt;huge e-bike expansion&lt;/a&gt;, the company is said to be in talks to go public via a reverse merger. Lime says its customers took more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;200 million rides&lt;/a&gt; on its e-scooters and e-bikes last year, with the company expecting that number to grow significantly in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWedYP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 6:39AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation that app-less riding uses Instant Apps on Android and App Clips on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4TDBLq"&gt;Tesla now accepts bitcoin as payment for its cars in the US, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374617643446063105"&gt;CEO Elon Musk announced&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. The option to pay using the cryptocurrency now appears on the company’s US website, where it’s available alongside the traditional card payment option. Musk said that the option to pay with bitcoin will be available to other countries “later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJpkZd"&gt;As well as confirming the availability of the new payment option, Musk offered some details on how Tesla is handling the cryptocurrency. “Tesla is using only internal &amp;amp; open source software &amp;amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly,” he said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619379929772034"&gt;followup tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619672973221892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PIMoMN"&gt;Tesla lays out how the bitcoin payment process &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/bitcoin"&gt;works in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on its site, where it notes that users will have the option of scanning a QR code or copying and pasting its bitcoin wallet address to initiate the payment. It adds that trying to send any other form of cryptocurrency to its wallet means it “will not receive the transaction and it will likely result in a loss of funds for you.” According to Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/assets/pdf/btc_terms_and_conditions_en_US.pdf"&gt;bitcoin payment terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt;, its cars will continue to be priced in US dollars, and customers who choose to will pay the equivalent value in bitcoin. Tesla estimates that a $100 deposit paid today equals 0.00183659 BTC, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuT8n"&gt;Tesla’s terms and conditions also caution that customers need to be careful when inputting both the bitcoin address and amount to be paid. It notes in all caps that “bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed” and “if you input the bitcoin address incorrectly, your bitcoin may be irretrievably lost or destroyed.” Customers are also responsible for directly paying all bitcoin transaction fees associated with their purchase, and Tesla warns that although bitcoin payments typically take less than an hour to complete, this can extend to up to “one day or more.” And because of bitcoin volatility, Tesla warns that the value of any refund made in bitcoin “might be significantly less” than the value of bitcoin relative to US dollars at the time of purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56b3b3"&gt;Tesla announced its intention to start accepting bitcoin as payment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;a little over a month ago&lt;/a&gt; in its annual 10-K report, when it said it would be adding the option in the “near future.” In the same filing, the company said it had also invested a total of $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency. The news sent the price of bitcoin up to over $43,000, an all-time high at the time. As of this writing, 1 bitcoin is now worth a little over $56,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Card doesn’t actually discriminate against women, investigators say</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyajTf9Mg34jE82TN9RbZPYFaWc=/190x0:2227x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015404/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.46.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vH6eAT"&gt;Goldman Sachs’ credit card policies were called into question when Basecamp designer David Heinemeier Hansson and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak claimed that their female partners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958953/apple-credit-card-gender-discrimination-algorithms-black-box-investigation"&gt;received lower Apple Card credit limits&lt;/a&gt; simply for being women. But a recently concluded New York State Department of Financial Services &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392556/rpt_202103_apple_card_investigation.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; has found Apple’s banking partner did not discriminate based on sex (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/goldman-didn-t-discriminate-with-apple-card-n-y-regulator-says"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1hOe2"&gt;NYSDFS investigators conducted a statistical analysis of almost 400,000 New York applicants that showed that the models and algorithms Goldman Sachs uses to filter applicants “did not consider prohibited characteristics of applicants and would not produce disparate impacts”. The regulator also stressed that the idea that spouses with shared finances would receive the same credit terms was a common misconception. Normal guidelines like credit history or unpaid debt were what determined whether or not a spouse received a higher limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zxrDDa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193330241478901760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ESgPe"&gt;For each cardholder that complained, the NYSDFS was also able to acquire specific justifications from Goldman Sachs for each decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EE5Szw"&gt;In each instance, the Bank was able to identify the factors that led to the credit decisions, such as credit score, indebtedness, income, credit utilization, missed payments, and other credit history elements. These decisions appeared to be consistent with the Bank’s credit policy, and none of the factors identified was an unlawful basis for a credit determination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EBakWJ"&gt;Even without a case for sexual or marital discrimination, the NYSDFS was critical of Goldman Sachs’ response to its concerned customers. Technically, banks only have to disclose elements of their credit policy when they deny someone a line of credit, but the NYSDFS says that Goldman Sachs could have had a plan in place to deal with customer confusion and make it easier for them to appeal their credit limits. In the initial rush to launch the Apple Card, the bank had done neither. &lt;/p&gt;
