    <title>Google warns of ‘novel social engineering method’ used to hack security researchers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3w9Tck"&gt;Government-backed hackers based in North Korea are targeting individual security researchers through a number of means including a “novel social engineering method,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/"&gt;Google’s Threat Analysis Group is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign has reportedly been ongoing for several months, and worryingly appears to exploit unpatched Windows 10 and Chrome vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiPI1D"&gt;Although Google doesn’t say exactly what the aim of the hacking campaign is, it notes that the targets are working on “vulnerability research and development.” This suggests the attackers may be trying to learn more about non-public vulnerabilities that they can use in future state-sponsored attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3jrxfc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hackers set up a network of Twitter accounts and a cybersecurity blog&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3njngg"&gt;According to Google, the hackers set up a cybersecurity blog and series of Twitter accounts in an apparent attempt to build and amplify credibility while interacting with potential targets. The blog focused on writing up vulnerabilities that were already public. Meanwhile, the Twitter accounts posted links to the blog, as well as other alleged exploits. At least one of the purported exploits was faked, according to Google. The search giant cites several cases of researchers’ machines having been infected simply by visiting the hackers’ blog, even when running the latest versions of Windows 10 and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVxzWD"&gt;The social engineering method outlined by Google involved contacting security researchers, and asking them to collaborate on their work. However, once they agreed, the hackers would send over a Visual Studio Project containing malware, which would infect the target’s computer and start contacting the attackers’ server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHfHb4"&gt;According to Google, the attackers used a range of different platforms — including Telegram, LinkedIn and Discord — to communicate with potential targets. Google listed specific hacker accounts &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt;. It says anyone who’s interacted with these accounts should scan their systems for any indication they’ve been compromised, and move their research activities onto a separate computer from their other day-to-day usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8vfr2"&gt;The campaign is the latest incident of security researchers being targeted by hackers. Last December, a leading US cybersecurity firm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;FireEye disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it had been compromised by a state-sponsored attacker. In the case of FireEye, the target of the hack were internal tools it uses to check for vulnerabilities in its client’s systems. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original Celeste now has a sequel you can play in your browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U0E70gbphXoO2TwoYrqSwiq8EgU=/0x74:500x407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720898/celeste_classic_sequel_gif.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="83jz55"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; was one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18137458/best-video-games-2018-xbox-ps4-switch"&gt;most acclaimed games of 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but what you may not have known is that the tightly designed platformer was an expanded version of a smaller project developed in four days at a game jam. Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry created the original &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; for the Pico-8 platform, and now that version has a sequel called &lt;em&gt;Celeste 2: Lani’s Trek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mizVYw"&gt;The developers, now including composer Lena Raine, say that this game took just three days to make. The release is to celebrate the third anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xzvR9S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We said we probably wouldn't make a sequel to Celeste, but we never said anything about Celeste Classic&lt;/p&gt;— Maddy Thorson (@MaddyThorson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaddyThorson/status/1353862386084581376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AtB9ws"&gt;If you’re not familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php"&gt;Pico-8&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a “virtual console” that gives developers a framework to build games as if it were actual hardware with defined technical capabilities. Games are limited to 128 x 128 resolution, for example, and a specific 16-color palette, which results in a distinctive look. Games can be accessed through the Pico-8 front end itself or distributed separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hUgM3"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Celeste 2&lt;/em&gt;’s case, you can download Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi versions for free &lt;a href="https://mattmakesgames.itch.io/celeste-classic-2"&gt;from Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, or play it in your browser at that link. (I would strongly recommend using a controller, since the keyboard controls are... tricky.) The soundtrack is also available &lt;a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/celeste-classic-2-lanis-trek-original-sound-version"&gt;on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook users’ phone numbers are for sale through a Telegram bot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skuYpDXh82rHINGiURSBJ9bJXxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720258/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ss4OD"&gt;Someone has gotten their hands on a database full of Facebook users’ phone numbers, and is now selling that data using a Telegram bot, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz7bd/facebook-phone-numbers-bot-telegram"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The security researcher who found this vulnerability, Alon Gal, says that the person who runs the bot claims to have the information of 533 million users, which came from a Facebook vulnerability that was patched in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gIirt"&gt;With many databases, some amount of technical skill is required to find any useful data. And there often has to be an interaction between the person with the database and the person trying to get information out of it, as the database’s “owner” isn’t going to just give someone else all that valuable data. Making a Telegram bot, however, solves both of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pp8v0H"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Few days ago a user created a Telegram bot allowing users to query the database for a low fee, enabling people to find the phone numbers linked to a very large portion of Facebook accounts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This obviously has a huge impact on privacy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/lM1omndDET"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lM1omndDET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alon Gal (Under the Breach) (@UnderTheBreach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1349671417625931778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xs9d8L"&gt;The bot allows someone to do two things: if they have a person’s Facebook user ID, they can find that person’s phone number, and if they have a person’s phone number they can find their Facebook user ID. Though, of course, actually getting access to the information you're looking for costs money — unlocking a piece of information, like a phone number or Facebook ID, costs one credit, which the person behind the bot is selling for $20. There’s also bulk pricing available, with 10,000 credits selling for $5,000, according to the Motherboard report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGZ9Eb"&gt;The bot has been running since at least January 12, 2021, according to screenshots posted by Gal, but the data it provides access to is from 2019. That’s relatively old, but people don’t change phone numbers that often. It’s especially embarrassing for Facebook as it historically collected phone numbers from people including users who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030068/facebook-friend-suggestions-2fa-security-phone-number-privacy-violation-ftc"&gt;were turning on two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ximEq2"&gt;At the moment it’s unknown if &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; or security researchers have contacted Telegram to try to get the bot taken down, but hopefully it’s something that can be clamped down on soon. That’s not to paint too rosy a picture, though — the data is still out there on the web, and it’s resurfaced a couple of times since it was initially scraped in 2019. I’m just hoping that the easy access will be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rejoice! Amazon’s new app icon isn’t just a logo in a white box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XehTHhcOFBSDbMFdiuHA3SueY4U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720166/download.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amazon/id335187483" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DUsEYd"&gt;It looks like Amazon is rolling a new app icon on iOS, and unlike countless other recent app redesigns, it isn’t just a logo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/2/26/18242369/slack-icon-android-ios-white-purple"&gt;dropped inside a white background&lt;/a&gt;! Rejoice! The new icon cleverly takes cues from perhaps Amazon’s most recognizable “product” — its shipping boxes and their bright blue tape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlkVmh"&gt;Here it is — in &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amazon/id335187483"&gt;the app’s listing on Apple’s UK App Store&lt;/a&gt;. (There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xerusdesign/status/1353864407785369601"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/northead/status/1353861529930772481"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DenisMarciniak/status/1353838774950703105"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thatjamesboy/status/1353807214264385537"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of others seeing the icon on their devices as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGR1ED2uNa6jdsD2sxJU8fC6swA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259694/Screen_Shot_2021_01_25_at_5.32.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VxL0R5"&gt;Whoever worked on this new app design, which will be instantly recognizable on your home screen, deserves a raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkSntW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; We’ve updated the headline to clarify that the new design is an icon, not a logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warning Signal: the messaging app’s new features are causing internal turmoil</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMekvAaB1N2LxmR-gAJYkraXL4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720026/acastro_210125_1777_signal_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The fast-growing encrypted messaging app is making itself increasingly vulnerable to abuse. Current and former employees are sounding the alarm.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="76xnG6"&gt;On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMQB9Y"&gt;The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;according to one research firm&lt;/a&gt;, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="H4pszq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Sdgc"&gt;The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121"&gt;says it added 90 million active users in January alone&lt;/a&gt; — the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7MjUR"&gt;Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMrW7G"&gt;“We’re organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTa7O8"&gt;But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bbeE6a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5jbgu"&gt;Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bv9p3t"&gt;“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCJWEe"&gt;Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2lkJ5J"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WZgVEB"&gt;Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fROAQM"&gt;Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages — much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update"&gt;adding a tool to automatically blur faces&lt;/a&gt; in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWnfgy"&gt;“That’s the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it’s used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y95EWn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“But until something is a reality, Moxie’s position is he’s not going to deal with it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mSjvgC"&gt;On October 28th, &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/"&gt;Signal added group links&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHp8Rk"&gt;But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f"&gt;stand back and stand by&lt;/a&gt;.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8PidZ"&gt;“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we’ll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie’s position is he’s not going to deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWmw3J"&gt;Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy — that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUpJbx"&gt;Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1p2REb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We would try to think really carefully about how we did that.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdlsi9"&gt;“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we’re building, how it’s used, and the kind of behaviors that we’re trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don’t want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCNK3D"&gt;At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue"&gt;raises privacy and security concerns&lt;/a&gt;. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URFtN3"&gt;Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiRTZM"&gt;An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way)."&gt;now known as Novi&lt;/a&gt;, has been &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/"&gt;repeatedly derailed&lt;/a&gt; by skeptical regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Ncig"&gt;In the past, Marlinspike has advised MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure — and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; wrote of the project in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it’s coming from a government or a criminal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEXvHK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees have been told that for Signal to become self-sustaining, it will need to reach 100 million users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jR5wbZ"&gt;People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXR3tT"&gt;Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5k0pss"&gt;“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8mmQi5"&gt;
&lt;p id="2hNl1z"&gt;Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. Signal’s development is supported by that loan, which filings show has grown to more than $100 million, and by donations from its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LoZZh"&gt;Employees have been told that for Signal to become self-sustaining, it will need to reach 100 million users. At that level, executives expect that donations will cover its costs and support the development of additional products that the company has considered, such as email or file storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQej5J"&gt;But messaging is a crowded field, with products from Apple, Facebook, Google, and, more recently, Telegram. Signal’s initial customer base of activists and journalists will only get it so far. And so despite its anti-corporate ethos, Signal has set about acquiring users like any other Silicon Valley app: by adding new features over time, starting with those that have proven successful in rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vKhjVp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I made a choice and a compromise. And I live with that every day.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UzhcGd"&gt;Those efforts have been led by two people in particular: Marlinspike, a former head of product security at Twitter whose long career in hacking and cryptography &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2020%2F10%2F26%2Ftaking-back-our-privacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22249391%2Fsignal-app-abuse-messaging-employees-violence-misinformation#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;was recently profiled in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Acton, whose title as executive chairman of the Signal Foundation dramatically understates his involvement in the project’s day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHDwK2"&gt;In 2014, Acton and co-founder Jan Koum sold WhatsApp to Facebook for $22 billion, making them both billionaires. Acton left the company in 2017, later &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/?sh=7e269bc43f20"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that his departure was prompted by Facebook’s plans to introduce targeted advertising and commercial messaging into WhatsApp. “I sold my users’ privacy to a larger benefit,” Acton told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. “I made a choice and a compromise. And I live with that every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1LytJ"&gt;A few months later, at the height of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, Acton caused a stir when he tweeted: “It is time. #deletefacebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38j5TI"&gt;Since then, he has increasingly devoted his time to building Signal. He participates in all-hands meetings and helps to set the overall direction of the company, employees said. He interviews engineers, screening them for their ideological commitment to encryption technology. He writes code and helps to solve engineering challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Af4RM"&gt;While working at Facebook, Acton could be dismissive of the idea that technology companies should intervene to prevent all forms of abuse. “There is no morality attached to technology, it’s people that attach morality to technology,” Acton told Steven Levy for his book &lt;em&gt;Facebook: The Inside Story&lt;/em&gt;. Acton continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qaqEK"&gt;“It’s not up to technologists to be the ones to render judgment. I don’t like being a nanny company. Insofar as people use a product in India or Myanmar or anywhere for hate crimes or terrorism or anything else, let’s stop looking at the technology and start asking questions about the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NjpHw3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Recently this has been an all-hands-on-deck kind of thing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RiPQYG"&gt;Asked about those comments, Signal told me that Acton does not have any role in setting policy for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSNdTY"&gt;In recent interviews, Acton has been magnanimous toward his former colleagues, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he expects most people will continue to use WhatsApp in addition to Signal. But it’s hard not to see in Acton’s recent work the outlines of a redemption narrative — a founder who regrets selling his old company deciding to try again, but with a twist. Or maybe it’s a revenge narrative: I detected more than a little disdain in Acton’s voice when he told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, “I have no desire to do all the things that WhatsApp does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt0i4g"&gt;Marlinspike told me that Acton’s increasingly heavy involvement in day-to-day development was a necessity given a series of recent departures at Signal, suggesting the WhatsApp co-founder might pull back once it was more fully staffed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXEe58"&gt;“Recently this has been an all-hands-on-deck kind of thing,” Marlinspike said. “He’s been great jumping in and helping where we need help, and helping us scale.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRsv1F"&gt;Still, Acton’s growing involvement could help explain the company’s general reticence toward implementing content policies. WhatsApp was not a “nanny company,” and it appears that neither will be Signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShJGF7"&gt;Whatever the case, Acton is clearly proud of Signal’s recent growth. “It was a slow burn for three years and then a huge explosion,” he told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; this month. “Now the rocket is going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="5P10BF"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Xgngf5"&gt;Some rockets make it into orbit. Others disintegrate in the atmosphere. Signal employees I spoke to worry that the app’s appetite for growth, coupled with inattention to potential misuses of the product, threaten its long-term future. (Of course, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; growing would threaten its long-term future in other ways.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QzoIa"&gt;It’s often said that social networks’ more disturbing consequences are a result of their business model. First, they take venture capital, pushing them to quickly grow as big as possible. Then, they adopt ad-based business models that reward users who spread misinformation, harass others, and otherwise sow chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="928guu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fascists are often quite public about their activities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2p5h5b"&gt;Signal’s story illustrates how simply changing an organization’s business model does not eliminate the potential for platform abuse. Wherever there are incentives to grow, and grow quickly, dangers will accumulate, no matter who is paying the engineers’ salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcV7GJ"&gt;Signal employees I spoke to said they are confident that the app has not become a primary organizing tool for extremists — though, given its encryption nature, it’s difficult to know for sure. So far, there are no known cases of dangerous organizations posting Signal group links on Twitter or other public spaces. (One employee pointed out that fascists are often quite public about their activities, as the recent insurrection in broad daylight at the Capitol showed.) Usernames and cryptocurrencies are unlikely to cause major problems for the organization until and unless they launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3OJ5P"&gt;At the same time, my sources expressed concern that despite the clear potential for abuse, Signal seemed content to make few efforts to mitigate any harms before they materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51PZ1U"&gt;“The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything,” Marlinspike told me. “We just have to be willing to iterate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0yVlzT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Signal exists to improve that experience and make it accessible to more people, even if bad actors might also find it useful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XfBFEv"&gt;On one hand, all software requires iteration. On the other hand, a failure to plan for abuse scenarios has been linked to calamities around the world. (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"&gt;Facebook’s links to genocide in Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, a country in which it originally had no moderators who understood the language, is the canonical example.) And it makes Signal’s potential path more similar to Facebook than its creators are perhaps prepared to admit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbIdlZ"&gt;In our conversation, Marlinspike committed to hiring an employee to work on issues related to policy and trust and safety. And he said Signal would change or even eliminate group links from the product if they were abused on a wide scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUjAY9"&gt;Still, Marlinspike said, it was important to him that Signal not become neutered in the pursuit of a false neutrality between good and bad actors. Marginalized groups depend on secure private messaging to safely conduct everything from basic day-to-day communication to organized activism, he told me. Signal exists to improve that experience and make it accessible to more people, even if bad actors might also find it useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp9L5p"&gt;“I want us as an organization to be really careful about doing things that make Signal less effective for those sort of bad actors if it would also make Signal less effective for the types of actors that we want to support and encourage,” he said. “Because I think that the latter have an outsized risk profile. There’s an asymmetry there, where it could end up affecting them more dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WibdNx"&gt;Bernstein, though, saw it differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9bhyk"&gt;“I think that’s a copout,” he said. “Nobody is saying to change Signal fundamentally. There are little things he could do to stop Signal from becoming a tool for tragic events, while still protecting the integrity of the product for the people who need it the most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lZPT9z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally stated Marlinspike is on the board of MobileCoin. While he has advised MobileCoin, he is not on the board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9MRO7O"&gt;
&lt;p id="OWXwhH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grindr fined $11.7 million for illegally sharing private user information with advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grindr" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nWc2exvjPOqIm7khgk_SjIe2tI=/2x0:1019x678/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68720012/Grindr.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PIRDdn"&gt;Grindr will be fined 100 million Norwegian kroner, or about $11.7 million, by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority for illegally sharing private information about Grindr users to advertisers, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/business/grindr-gdpr-privacy-fine.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5f4II"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065481/grindr-gdpr-data-sharing-complaint-advertising-mopub-match-group-okcupid-tinder"&gt;Last January&lt;/a&gt;, the Norwegian Consumer Council filed three complaints against Grindr for sharing personal information, including users’ locations and information about the device they were using, with advertisers. (One of those advertisers was MoPub, Twitter’s mobile ads company.) Associating that information with an individual could potentially indicate that person’s sexual orientation without their consent, and now, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority is taking action against Grindr for the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z2kN1"&gt;Grindr has until February 15th to comment on the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkUvvN"&gt;“We continually enhance our privacy practices in consideration of evolving privacy laws and regulations, and look forward to entering into a productive dialogue with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority,” Bill Shafton, Grindr’s VP of business and legal affairs, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09w5WO"&gt;The app isn’t particularly well-known for taking great care of its users’ security. Grindr was caught exposing users’ HIV statuses to two other companies in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17188922/grindr-hiv-status-privacy-data"&gt;April 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/grindr-stopped-sharing-hiv-status"&gt;has stopped doing&lt;/a&gt;. And with one particularly bad vulnerability, which we wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/3/21500447/grindr-copy-paste-security-flaw-user-account"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, anyone who knew your email address could potentially access your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjRS8y"&gt;Grindr has a new owner after a US government committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168079/grindr-sold-chinese-owner-us-cfius-security-concerns-kunlun-lgbtq"&gt;expressed national security&lt;/a&gt; concerns about the app — it was sold by its Chinese owners to investor group San Vicente Acquisition in March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s News tab comes to UK in first launch outside of the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7mPdCMruAp5aOocoroD54co3ik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719848/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MarpJ1"&gt;Facebook’s News tab will go live in the UK on January 26th in its first launch outside the US. The company says the section will offer a mix of curated and personalized news stories, but for select publishers the bigger news is that it will see Facebook paying them to license their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbjxrb"&gt;Although Facebook declined to give information on the amount it expects to pay publishers, a spokesperson said the company plans to invest “substantial” amounts over a number of years. These payments are expected to mainly go to publishers whose content isn’t already on Facebook — for instance, like content that’s normally paywalled. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/01/facebook-to-pay-uk-media-millions-to-licence-news-stories"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that some publishers expect these payments to be worth millions of pounds a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guuDyj"&gt;Alongside the news of the section’s launch, Facebook is announcing a number of new publishing partners whose stories it’ll include. These include the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, Sky News, Channel 4 News, Telegraph Media Group, DC Thomson, and the Daily Mail group. These join existing publishers announced by Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754847/facebook-news-tab-uk-launch-january-2021-paying-publishers-partner"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Vogue&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and local news sites from publishers like Reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5QXrN1I5-Rwize6jUaW0q790as0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258375/__News_Tab___UK_cropped.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tab features a mix of curated and personalized stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGXKFIxnrjh7ulohAF7MO1VGfao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258374/__Controls___UK_cropped.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are also controls to allow you to hide articles or publications from your feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fLxciz"&gt;Facebook News will include a combination of curated stories chosen by “a team of journalists” and articles that are shown based on what users read, share, and follow, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;how the section works in the US&lt;/a&gt;. The company promises that it’ll provide controls to let you hide topics or publishers from your feed if you don’t want to see them. New digests will also be produced to cover major news stories (such as stories relating to the COVID-19 pandemic), which Facebook says will highlight “original and authoritative reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrnz6v"&gt;While Facebook News offers a dedicated section in the app for browsing news stories, the company emphasizes that users will still be able to share articles from their profiles and pages, and will be able to read them via the News Feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAJRIp"&gt;As well as launching in the UK on Tuesday, Facebook says it’s currently in “active negotiations” with partners to launch the feature in France and Germany. In August last year, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;launch of the News tab in the US&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400960/facebook-news-tab-expand-plans-brazil-germany-uk-india-france"&gt;listed Brazil and India&lt;/a&gt; as two additional countries to which it was considering bringing the section.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amnesty International calls for a ban on facial recognition in New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7EslQ_sI97vO6VlLyrxFeLk7A8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719846/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bNyO1K"&gt;Amnesty International has launched a new campaign against facial recognition titled &lt;a href="http://www.banthescan.amnesty.org/"&gt;Ban The Scan&lt;/a&gt; — and is launching with a demand for New York City to halt police and government use of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyTohf"&gt;Amnesty argues facial recognition is incompatible with basic privacy rights, and will exacerbate structural racism in policing tactics. “New Yorkers should be able to go out about their daily lives without being tracked by facial recognition,” said Matt Mahmoudi, an AI and human rights researcher with Amnesty. “Other major cities across the US have already banned facial recognition, and New York must do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gWNnOO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The NYPD has used facial recognition to track tens of thousands of New Yorkers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qIurc"&gt;Amnesty is joined in the New York portion of the campaign by a range of groups, including the Urban Justice Center, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the city’s Public Advocate office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEOf6e"&gt;The New York Police Department has run afoul of facial recognition critics before, most notably when it used facial recognition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram"&gt;to locate and arrest a Black Lives Matter activist&lt;/a&gt; in August. The department claims it &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0313/press-release---nypd-facial-recognition-policy"&gt;only uses facial recognition to generate leads&lt;/a&gt;, and doesn’t make arrests based on the information. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/9608-nypd-facial-recognition-policy-leeway-department-not-using-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;many civil liberties groups&lt;/a&gt; find the existing protections inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYagEx"&gt;The Ban the Scan campaign is launching with a website that will allow users to leave comments on the NYPD’s policies through a local public oversight rule. Later, Amnesty plans to build in a tool for filing &lt;a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/coog/freedomfaq.html"&gt;Freedom of Information Law&lt;/a&gt; requests, and in May, a tool to geolocate facial-recognition-capable cameras throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbhbSs"&gt;“For years, the NYPD has used facial recognition to track tens of thousands of New Yorkers, putting New Yorkers of color at risk of false arrest and police violence,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center in a statement. “Banning facial recognition won’t just protect civil rights: it’s a matter of life and death.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has a new head of hardware engineering in latest executive shuffle</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NBEKW7"&gt;Apple’s hardware team is getting its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fdan-riccio-begins-a-new-chapter-at-apple%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;biggest shakeup&lt;/a&gt; in nearly a decade, as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Fdan-riccio%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dan Riccio&lt;/a&gt; — who served as the company’s senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012 — transitions to “a new role” at the company. He’ll be replaced as Apple’s head hardware engineer by John Ternus, who led the hardware team designing the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, in addition to working on Apple’s M1 chips. Ternus has been vice president of hardware engineering at Apple since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to8wIv"&gt;The role of senior vice president of hardware engineering at Apple is a key one: the position reports directly to CEO Tim Cook and is responsible for leading the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and iPod engineering teams. Ternus’ new role will put him in charge of the company’s hardware efforts, much in the same way that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Fcraig-federighi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22249393%2Fapple-senior-vice-president-hardware-engineering-dan-riccio-john-ternus-new#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Craig Federighi&lt;/a&gt; — Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering — runs the development of iOS and macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKhEUo"&gt;Riccio won’t be leaving Apple, though: he’ll be working on an unspecified “new project” for the company in a role directly reporting to Cook. “Next up, I’m looking forward to doing what I love most — focusing all my time and energy at Apple on creating something new and wonderful that I couldn’t be more excited about,” explains Riccio in Apple’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8UdolxBHH9VEnHKDHAnyp9a23w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259288/Apple_dan_riccio_begins_a_new_chapter_at_apple_01252020_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Riccio, Apple’s now-former SVP of hardware engineering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g6eoId"&gt;If that language sounds familiar, it’s because it’s almost the exact same description that Apple provided for Riccio’s predecessor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/27/3272577/apple-bob-mansfield-dan-riccio-engineering"&gt;Bob Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;, when he stepped down as SVP of hardware engineering in 2012. Like Riccio, Mansfield transitioned to “work on future projects” in an unnamed role that reported directly to Cook — which &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/apple-shifts-leadership-of-self-driving-car-division-to-ai-chief"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; included leading Apple’s self-driving car team until December 2020, when Mansfield fully retired from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pND1HN"&gt;Apple’s future automotive ambitions are currently being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;led by artificial intelligence executive John Giannandrea&lt;/a&gt;. But following Mansfield’s departure, there would appear to be a vacancy in senior hardware engineers on that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19PYcm"&gt;Riccio’s move is the latest departure from Apple’s executive leadership team in recent years, following legendary product designer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20986838/jony-ive-last-day-apple"&gt;Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt; (who stepped down to form his own design firm, LoveFrom, in November 2019) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354367/apple-phil-schiller-fellow-greg-joswiak-head-marketing-store-events"&gt;Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, who was replaced by Greg Joswiak in 2020 as Schiller refocused on running the App Store and Apple Events. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden wants to replace government fleet with electric vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PW58tzRJVIVSLnww26Ctf0oJA3E=/72x0:6368x4197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68719405/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zcvx0Y"&gt;President Joe Biden will start the process of phasing out the federal government’s use of gas-powered vehicles and replacing them with ones that run on electricity. The announcement is the fulfillment of a promise Biden made on the campaign trail to swap government fleet vehicles with American-made EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nMouO"&gt;“The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers,” Biden said during a briefing Monday announcing his “Buy American” executive order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nr3CGT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pres. Biden: "The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we're going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers."&lt;a href="https://t.co/figJbDMrpt"&gt;https://t.co/figJbDMrpt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/racgwk9VGw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/racgwk9VGw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ABC News Live (@ABCNewsLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABCNewsLive/status/1353809013348171778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Towotc"&gt;This is great news for US-based EV makers like Tesla, Rivian, and Lordstown, as well as legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors that are in the midst of multibillion-dollar investments in electric vehicle production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL7Xku"&gt;As of 2019, there were nearly 650,000 vehicles in the federal government’s fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/vehicle-management-policy/federal-fleet-report"&gt;according to the General Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;. This includes 245,000 civilian vehicles, 173,000 military vehicles, and 225,000 post office vehicles. Those vehicles traveled 4.5 billion miles in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLU1mq"&gt;Biden also promised to create a system that offers rebates or incentives for consumers to replace gas cars with electric vehicles — though there aren’t any more details about that plan at this moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ueJtm1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden promised rebates for consumers to replace gas cars with electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRp2NS"&gt;The details of both plans are still being worked out, but taken together, they represent a huge win for the EV investments made by automakers over the last several years. Ford has said it will spend $11 billion introducing a raft of new EVs, including the Mustang Mach-E and an electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck. GM has committed to spending $27 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUJaS"&gt;Meanwhile, Tesla’s remarkable stock market rally throughout 2020 has made it the most valuable automaker in the world, and its CEO Elon Musk the richest man on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANrji9"&gt;Biden’s order may not be a direct win for Tesla, though, which has mostly focused on luxury and performance vehicles. Automakers that could benefit include Ford, which recently unveiled an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;electric version of its Transit vans&lt;/a&gt;, and GM, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;spun out a new company called BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt; focused on electric delivery vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc0gCQ"&gt;One federal agency that could desperately use a new fleet of zero-emissions vehicles is the United States Postal Service. Hundreds of the agency’s mail trucks, which are manufactured by Northrop Grumman, have caught fire over the last several years, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3ezx4/post-office-delivery-trucks-keep-catching-on-fire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt;. And the USPS’s deadline for official bids to make its next-generation mail truck was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;delayed last year&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIcXgY"&gt;The program to replace the USPS’s current trucks was launched in 2015. But it has dragged on, forcing the postal service to keep its current trucks in service past their expected life span — despite the fact that they were introduced in the late 1980s and early ‘90s and lack features like air conditioning. Two of the original six companies have dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jnr6U"&gt;One of &lt;a href="https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/#"&gt;Biden’s goals&lt;/a&gt; is to create 1 million new jobs in the auto sector and to “position America to be the global leader in the manufacture of electric vehicles and their input materials and parts.” The president has said he will reach that goal by swapping out the government’s fleet for electric vehicles and through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931983/schumer-electric-car-trade-in-gas-discount-proposal-zero-emission"&gt;“cash-for-clunkers”-style plan&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that every vehicle on the road is zero-emission by 2040. And he pledged to spend billions of dollars to add 550,000 EV charging stations in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22P2hj"&gt;Biden has also said he supports the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles and would be open to considering new incentives to encourage car buyers to consider making the switch to electric. Former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-11-trump-budget-2020-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html"&gt;tried to end the federal EV tax credit&lt;/a&gt; in his 2020 budget proposal but was not successful. Also under Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency rolled back Obama-era emissions rules aimed at forcing the auto industry to manufacture less-polluting vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZlwkE"&gt;Biden has already taken steps to roll back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;Trump’s rollback&lt;/a&gt; (roll forward?) of the Obama-era emissions rules. On the day of his inauguration, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biden-executive-actions-transportati/biden-to-order-agencies-to-revisit-vehicle-tailpipe-emissions-standards-idUSL1N2JV08I"&gt;Biden ordered&lt;/a&gt; federal agencies to revisit fuel efficiency standards as well as rules governing emissions from airplanes and appliance and building energy efficiency standards. &lt;/p&gt;
