    <title>Samsung announces Galaxy Buds 2 with active noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYmdftXD65HRDUQ3mF5BLeRn598=/0x81:2040x1441/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709726/02_02_Berry_Family_01_galaxybuds2_family_graphite_white_olive_lavender_H.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qlb9bM"&gt;In addition to launching two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; foldable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381267"&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt; and a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22382573"&gt;smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung today announced its latest set of wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 2 cost $149.99 and will replace the Galaxy Buds Plus in the company’s lineup. (It’s still possible to find remaining stock of the Buds Plus at some retailers, but they’ll be gone once that inventory runs dry.) Preorders start today in a range of colors that include dark gray, white, purple, and green, and the Buds 2 will be available on August 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wIFP0"&gt;They’ve got a design that’s similar to the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, only smaller. In fact, Samsung says these are the smallest and lightest true wireless earbuds it has made yet. Also like the Buds Pro, the Buds 2 have two-way drivers with a woofer and tweeter in each earbud that “deliver crisp, clear high notes and a deep bass.” They set themselves apart from the older Buds Plus with the addition of active noise cancellation, and Samsung includes an ambient sound mode that lets you adjust how much outside noise is let through. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uj51j-oVYboufbVKgY8BFuIh9zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775057/DSC01569.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 come in four colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3hGXR"&gt;Battery life for the Buds 2 is up to five hours of continuous playback with noise cancellation enabled (or 20 hours including the case). Switching off the ANC can extend those numbers to 7.5 hours and 29 hours with the case, which supports wireless charging. That doesn’t quite match the marathon 11 hours of nonstop listening that was possible with the Galaxy Buds Plus, but I think Samsung has made enough improvements here to accept that tradeoff. Just don’t expect much in the way of water or sweat resistance, as these are only rated IPX2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfZXyk"&gt;The Galaxy Buds 2 are now the cheapest product in Samsung’s earbuds lineup: they join the $199.99 Galaxy Buds Plus and $169.99 Galaxy Buds Live, though both of those sets are on sale as I write this. I’d expect similar discounts on the Buds 2 eventually, which might make them hard to resist as the new default wireless buds for many Android users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vkAy_MA7eXdDv0cMKvhzUoQFHcQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709729/cwelch_210809_4701_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The flagship foldable now has a 120Hz cover screen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0w0eqe"&gt;It’s August, and today is Samsung’s latest big Unpacked event. Normally that would mean the time has come for a new Galaxy Note. But in the company’s own words, not “this time around.” There’s no new Note being announced this year, and so the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra will stay right where they are in Samsung’s lineup. Instead, this summer the focus is on  what Samsung sees as the future of phones: foldables. The company has just introduced the new Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, a pair of devices that showcase the potential of folding screens in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tIGL5"&gt;The Z Fold 3 is a productivity powerhouse that now has 120Hz displays both inside and out. And it’s carrying over some of the Galaxy Note’s DNA by adding support for the S Pen stylus. But what’s even more important than the usual spec upgrades is the message Samsung is sending about durability: the Fold 3 is more resilient than its predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeOr2A"&gt;Remember: this is technically the &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; Galaxy Fold if you count the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511170/samsung-galaxy-fold-delay-indefinitely-statement-screen-display-broken-issues"&gt;flawed, abandoned first attempt&lt;/a&gt;, and the company recognizes there are still lingering durability concerns it needs to overcome. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;made strides with the Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, but some people still encountered cracking screens and other show-stopping problems from normal usage that just shouldn’t happen — even if Samsung’s customer service made it right for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N7EqwY3wJ9ltWxXj_rzTis_zbNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773894/cwelch_210809_4701_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s first foldable phone to work with the S Pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0ZZgK"&gt;So for the Fold 3, Samsung made a slew of changes to the device’s materials and internal design that should give the $1,799 foldable smartphone a better chance of lasting years into the future. It looks similar to the Fold 2, but refinements are everywhere. The screen’s protective film is now 80 percent stronger; Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;using Gorilla Glass Victus on the cover screen&lt;/a&gt; for improved drop protection; the aluminum in the Fold 3’s hinge is now 10 percent stronger. And the entire device is now rated IPX8 for water resistance, meaning you can submerge it for up to 30 minutes and it should come out unscathed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9Y8uLKny8i2vHz8hkHx8fuOFRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773896/cwelch_210809_4701_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3’s cover screen now has an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IpchRbs_7eLZFtcrhVgYxG4wsNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773904/cwelch_210809_4701_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otherwise it’s very similar to last year’s Z Fold 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PVh7xk"&gt;The Z Fold 3 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888, has 12GB of RAM, and comes in 256GB or 512GB storage configurations. Its three rear cameras are close to what was in the Fold 2: the f/1.8 wide, f/2.0 ultra-wide, and f/2.4 telephoto cameras still use 12-megapixel sensors and the apertures are unchanged. But the tele lens now features optical image stabilization. The 10MP camera on the cover screen is also the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Y5TlP"&gt;But there’s quite a change to the camera that’s on the Fold 3’s primary screen. Samsung has switched from a hole-punch selfie camera to an under-display camera. It’s not the first time we’ve seen such an approach; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617979/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-announced-under-display-camera-cup-specs-price"&gt;Xiaomi just yesterday announced&lt;/a&gt; a phone with an under-display camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aAdAF"&gt;Samsung’s got a 4-megapixel sensor beneath the screen’s pixels. That sounds measly for photos, but the purpose of this camera is really for video chats. The company says it’s perfectly adequate for Zoom calls and other videoconferencing, and 4MP is good enough to produce HD video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0uZEXIAL1p8orTp4RdCOHJ7qU9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775779/ZFOLD_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s no missing the under-display camera if you look for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPGLa5nbrdYr_7gIMymosUaJXQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775788/ZFOLD_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it does a better job blending in when your eyes are focused elsewhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uR0ssg"&gt;But let’s just be up front about it: you can absolutely tell there’s a camera in there. Samsung says there are “minimum pixels applied on top of the camera hole,” and they’re extremely noticeable when you’re looking right at the circle. (It’s even more obvious in photos, so don’t be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; put off by the image below.) The point isn’t to completely hide the camera; it’s to make the display feel like an “unbroken canvas” when you’re using the phone. Focus on any other part of the screen, and the under-display camera sort of vanishes from view in a way that a hole-punch camera wouldn’t. It still seems like a lot of work for minimal payoff, but sometimes Samsung just likes to flex. Also, yes, the crease in the middle of the screen is still present. I find myself barely noticing it when the display is on, but it’s very much there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFYS-xmn2aq5btTOh9Oo4RvrEwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773900/cwelch_210809_4701_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung is confident the display can handle stylus input.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7zlYU"&gt;As for the S Pen, the stylus works on the Fold 3’s 7.6-inch primary screen — though oddly not the cover display, Samsung told me. The company developed a special “Fold Edition” S Pen that covers all the basics, and the more expensive S Pen Pro is also supported and adds air gestures and some Bluetooth tricks. (Both are sold separately from the Fold 3.) The S Pen Pro has a nifty toggle switch that you can flip when using the stylus with other Samsung devices; they apparently use a different frequency than the Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN1PLd"&gt;Both compatible S Pens have “a specially engineered retractable tip” that limits the force you can apply to the Fold 3’s screen. The screen protector might be 80 percent stronger, but it’s still delicate ultra-thin glass under there. Even so, I pressed down fairly hard during my hands-on time with the phone, and neither S Pen left any permanent line marks on the protective film. But I realize that’s not helpful for determining how the Fold 3 will hold up to a year or more of taking notes, sketching, editing PDFs, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlrS26qU2ytWFumU0g7-BPL0NOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773901/cwelch_210809_4701_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Fold 3 supports the Fold Edition S Pen and S Pen Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0aQDu2"&gt;Samsung seems determined to help Z Fold 3 owners do more with its spacious screen real estate — even in cases where app developers aren’t yet on board. A new Labs feature in settings lets you put any app into split-screen or pop-up view when multitasking. You can also customize an app’s aspect ratio. The company says it has polished up the multitasking gestures and is promising an experience that feels more cohesive and intuitive. You can now permanently pin your Edge Panel to the side of the screen like a dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEuNaZ97IGDaIQXWX_fVC1kIvuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773903/cwelch_210809_4701_0020.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="N4bzU7"&gt;Preorders for Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 start today and it’s available in three colors: black, green, and silver. The flagship foldable will go on sale August 27th alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 3, Galaxy Buds 2, and two new smartwatches that Samsung also introduced today. Stay tuned for our full review soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 announced with much bigger, more useful cover display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eduWjOCaMeCVpz_GBpyOQY_o_jc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709727/cwelch_210809_4701_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;What a difference a usable secondary screen can make&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jp5CFV"&gt;For all the multitasking prowess and sheer productivity potential Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22381247"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; offers, there’s something about the just-announced Galaxy Z Flip 3 that’s got me even more excited. Maybe it’s the look: one of the colors is a fantastic cream hue that reminds me of vintage ‘70s gadgets. More likely, it’s the larger outer display that’s so much more practical and useful than the teeny, tiny cover display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;on the original Flip&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an it factor about this phone that I can’t put my finger on. Honestly, there’s just a feeling of &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; to the Flip 3 — right down to the stylish cases Samsung is making for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ybxJ2"&gt;A lower price is certainly part of the appeal: the Galaxy Z Flip 3 starts at $999, bringing Samsung’s foldables down below the $1,000 mark (without discounts) for the first time. That’ll get you 128GB storage and 8GB of RAM. Like the much pricier Fold 3, the Flip 3 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888, has robust 5G support, and is IPX8 water resistant — so it can survive a swim. Like last year, Samsung is including a pair of wide and ultrawide rear cameras around back. Both are 12-megapixel sensors, with the standard camera offering an f/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization, and the ability to record HDR10+ video. Digital zoom tops out at 10x, so you’re not getting the extended “space zoom” capabilities of the S21 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WE-15X7mD6EOAfeTGJ80Od5eXyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773884/cwelch_210809_4701_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3’s primary screen now tops out at a smoother 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aLU7M9"&gt;The primary 6.7-inch, 22:9 display has been upgraded from 60Hz and now has a smoother 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that adjusts automatically to optimize battery life. There’s still a selfie camera cutout at the top of the screen; Samsung switched to an under-display camera on the Fold 3, but kept things simpler here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnY7rb"&gt;On both phones, the company has made durability improvements to the protective film that covers the ultra-thin glass. In the case of the Flip 3, Samsung says it’s 30 percent stronger. That could lead to fewer blemishes and indentations on the screen protector. But hopefully it’ll also mean fewer phones that break unexpectedly from perfectly normal, daily use — a frustration experienced by some owners of the original Flip and Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXzvpXH_RmM6k8pub0w6H6JpKc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773888/cwelch_210809_4701_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung is selling some fun cases for the Z Flip 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiPRXm5_Bjo5GCPSOUc4nAYKdSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773890/cwelch_210809_4701_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, the crease is still evident when the display is off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aby4E4"&gt;A smoother primary display is certainly a welcome improvement, but the most critical upgrade to the Z Flip 3 is that outer cover screen. It’s now four times larger than the small oval that was of such little use on the original Z Flip. This time you’ve got more room. More room for widgets (music, calendar, timer, weather, etc.) and more room for checking notifications: Samsung says the cover screen can show several lines of text. Clearly Samsung has taken some lessons from Motorola’s Razr foldable here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ7fDz"&gt;In fact, the cover screen is now big enough that you can use it as a viewfinder when taking selfies. Samsung says it can be used for video recording and vlogs, but to me that would be pushing it. You can also access Android’s quick settings or use Samsung Pay from the cover display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2EbG-bY5V9eWt18OKDos1SQweGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773887/cwelch_210809_4701_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cover screen is now four times larger and way more useful as a result.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ubQPf"&gt;Expanding the size of that outer screen makes the whole concept of the Z Flip 3 so much more appealing to me. It feels like Samsung has made enough refinements that you’ll be able to pull the folded phone out of your pocket, respond to a notification or text without having to open it, and tuck it back away. It lends the phone’s purpose more legitimacy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDMTpPKrcJIjkLtcYaBZFf1oVXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773891/cwelch_210809_4701_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHnr4G"&gt;Other upgrades to the Z Flip 3 that aren’t so obvious at first glance include new stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos audio. And Samsung says the Flip 3’s “Flex Mode” — activated when the phone is partially folded — will put media like videos or album art at the top half and automatically relocate controls to the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xqnd3E"&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is being offered in seven colors: cream, green, purple, black, gray, white, and pink; the latter three are exclusively available from Samsung’s website. Preorders start today, and the phone will be available in stores on August 27th. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Samsung and Google’s smartwatch collaboration is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="M9hwia"&gt;Today we’re getting our first look at the fruits of Samsung’s smartwatch collaboration with Google: the new Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. It’s a big deal in wearables, because after years of trying to go it alone with its own Tizen platform on smartwatches, Samsung is finally biting the bullet and collaborating with Google on its operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HavTB"&gt;I get the sense with these two smartwatches that Samsung is hitting a bit of a reset button with its wearables lineup. Yes, there’s the Wear OS operating system, but Samsung is also taking the opportunity to tweak the branding on its ranges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ditiAU"&gt;So instead of splitting its smartwatches between the Active and regular ranges, now there’s the default Watch 4 and the more premium Watch 4 Classic. The Watch 4 is best thought of as a successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20903452/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-fitness-tizen-apps-features-android-price"&gt;Watch Active 2 from 2019&lt;/a&gt; (which means that, yes, Samsung has skipped the Active 3, RIP), while the Watch 4 Classic with its chunkier design and rotating bezel looks like a follow-up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;last year’s Watch 3&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the Galaxy Watch 4 is now the default, and the Classic is the step-up version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIq94H"&gt;The Watch 4 Classic starts at $349 for the Bluetooth model, rising to $399 for the LTE model, while the Watch 4 is a little less expensive with a starting price of $249 (or $299 with LTE). Both are available to preorder today, and ship August 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eXHvULW6AqOtYBVmhDfugp7fYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775097/BFARSACE_210810_4707_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right: the 44mm and 40mm Watch 4, and the 46mm and 42mm Watch 4 Classic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBA8HaScVlVMd4Sr7-ZYsdSn1lg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775095/BFARSACE_210810_4707_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Watch 4 Classic, with its physical rotating bezel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7GL6Xp"&gt;The big difference between the two models is that the Watch 4 Classic has one of those physical rotating bezels that we’ve liked so much on Samsung’s previous smartwatches, while if you opt for the standard Watch 4, there’s a touch-sensitive bezel accessible by swiping at the edges of the screen. The Watch 4 Classic is also made of a more premium stainless steel rather than the aluminum you’ll find on the Watch 4. On the right of both watches are a pair of control buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wGLJG"&gt;The lack of a physical bezel means the Watch 4 is the more compact of the two models, and it’s also around a millimeter slimmer than its predecessor, the Active 2. The Watch 4 is available in 40mm and 44mm versions, while the Watch 4 Classic is available in 42mm and 46mm versions. But both ranges have the same screen sizes and resolutions, with a choice of either a 1.2-inch 396 x 396 display in the smaller body or a 1.4-inch 450 x 450 display in the larger one. That means higher resolution screens across the board, particularly if you opt for a larger model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uefjn1"&gt;External differences aside, internally both watches share a lot of the same specs. They’re both powered by the same 5nm Exynos W920 processor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617873/samsung-exynos-w920-chip-announced-galaxy-watch-4"&gt;Samsung detailed yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, paired with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Battery capacity varies between sizes, but Samsung reckons you’ll average around 40 hours of battery life regardless of model. There’s LTE on select models, but if you were hoping for 5G, you’ll be disappointed — Samsung says it doesn’t think it’s worth it because the amount of data smartwatches process is too small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CFMtn1am2d92vNopV6ExFW6IP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775093/BFARSACE_210810_4707_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Watch 4 Classic in silver and black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLCstz"&gt;But the biggest departure from Samsung’s previous smartwatches is that the Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic aren’t running its own Tizen operating system. Instead, their software is the result of a collaboration between Samsung and Google, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung is branding the watches’ operating system as “Wear OS Powered by Samsung” although Google has called it &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/118166873/what-wear-os-3-means-for-you?hl=en"&gt;Wear OS 3&lt;/a&gt;. But either way, the hope is that it combines the best of Tizen with the best of Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQofbU"&gt;On Samsung’s watches specifically, the interface you’re looking at is One UI Watch, which is effectively Samsung’s skin sitting on top of Wear OS. Think of it as Samsung’s One UI software on phones, which works with Google’s Android. It gives the Watch 4’s interface a similar look and feel to Samsung’s previous Tizen-powered watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrgien"&gt;Google has promised its collaboration with Samsung will lead to a host of high-level benefits for Wear OS, like improved battery life, faster loading apps, and smoother animations. But in the time I spent with the Watch 4, it was a little hard to get a sense of these improvements because they’ve never really been a problem for Samsung’s previous watches and I certainly didn’t have enough time to test out battery life. The real test will be when we start to see Wear OS 3 watches from former manufacturers that have exclusively used Wear OS in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YK9yLP"&gt;One obvious improvement of running an operating system developed with Google is that the search giant’s apps are available to use. There’s Google Maps for getting around, Google Pay, and YouTube Music. The one big question mark surrounds Google’s voice assistant, especially given the reputation of Samsung’s own voice assistant Bixby. Samsung tells me Google Assistant won’t be available at launch, and it’s an open question whether it’ll arrive at a later date. For now, that means Bixby continues to be your only voice assistant option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7FJ1o"&gt;Beyond its voice assistant, Samsung’s other software also isn’t going anywhere. You’ll still have access to Samsung Pay and SmartThings, so there shouldn’t be any disruption if you’re already bought into Samsung’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLJpe9"&gt;As Samsung previously announced, the smartwatches are also capable of syncing some settings from your phone like do not disturb and your blocked callers, as well as automatically installing watch apps when you have the phone version installed (a big improvement over Tizen’s old manual process). Samsung tells me these options should work across most Android phones with Google Mobile Services, not just Samsung’s, and indicated that we should see similar features with future Wear OS watches. Alongside the convenient option of automatically installing apps via a phone, the Google Play Store is also accessible from the watch itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUloQR"&gt;There are already promising signs that having fewer different smartwatch operating systems to target might mean better app support from third-party developers. Although it’s not new for Samsung’s wearables, Spotify has an app coming to the operating system with support for offline listening. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PtKh31ILOFj80mdt1yMg-FHIfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775100/BFARSACE_210810_4707_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Watch 4 is slimmer...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Se66vxpIYRkSJO7VjG9bX7JlmWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775099/BFARSACE_210810_4707_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...while the Watch 4 Classic has a slightly chunkier look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIgqJl"&gt;There are also new health features to talk about with the Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic, many of which focus around Samsung’s new 3-in-1 BioActive sensor. It combines an optical heart rate sensor, electrical heart sensor, and a bioelectric impedance analysis sensor which means detection of everything from atrial fibrillation to blood oxygen levels and body composition. It’ll also monitor your blood pressure in certain markets, although not in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsMckk"&gt;Samsung’s pitch is that in addition to detecting this all individually, its new smartwatches do a better job at giving you a holistic view of your overall health. There’s a new Body Composition measurement tool, which works by having you place two fingers on the watch’s right buttons and then gives you a bunch of metrics like your skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage, and metabolic rate to poke around in. Samsung hasn’t mentioned whether the watch will sync with Google’s Fit or Fitbit accounts, but it feels like this could leave the watches packed with an almost confusing number of different fitness-tracking services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDKPJb"&gt;Finally, there’s sleep tracking. Samsung says its new watches can track your blood oxygen levels while you sleep and offer more insight into your sleep patterns, while compatible smartphones can also help by detecting the sound of snoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SzYPPIhTKPz_I1mkEV-vXZqKthk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775096/BFARSACE_210810_4707_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As well as a physical rotating bezel, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic has two buttons on its right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vcBkJew-P7g6zZOgj08aQaUPF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775098/BFARSACE_210810_4707_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two models in two different sizes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DNDS8x"&gt;Samsung’s smartwatches have been our recommendation for anyone with an Android phone for a little while, but it feels like Samsung has hit a ceiling on what it can achieve while it’s still using its own software. They’ve struggled with third-party app support and have tended to work best when used with Samsung’s Android phones specifically, requiring an array of separate apps to get the most out of the watches with non-Samsung phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="c6pagX"&gt;That’s what makes this year’s smartwatches, and Google and Samsung’s collaboration in general, so exciting. It banishes so many of those little issues, like a lack of native Google apps, that have been problematic for Samsung’s recent watches. Last year we said it was time for a change from Samsung. We’ll have to see in our full review whether Samsung has successfully made it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5j3npP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oversight board orders Facebook to restore post criticizing Myanmar coup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WseGUXJRK-E8xHB8CND4HmBMbPc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709663/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0zlRxf"&gt;The Facebook Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-ZWQUPZLZ/"&gt;has ordered Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to restore a post from a user in Myanmar criticizing the country’s new regime and its ties with China. The post was initially taken down for violating policies on racial hate speech against Chinese people, but the Oversight Board found the offending phrase was more appropriately viewed as political criticism of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71pq22"&gt;Issued on Wednesday morning, the decision turned on how Facebook moderators translated a specific Burmese word, rendered in the post as “$တရုတ်.” Facebook had translated the word as “fucking Chinese” and classified it as Tier 2 hate speech under &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/hate_speech"&gt;the platform’s community standard&lt;/a&gt;. The user appealed the decision, describing the post as advice to elected leaders and saying the post should be reviewed by “someone who understands the Myanmar language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8kysiQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“automatically selected ... for classifier training”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pqaaJC"&gt;After reviewing the post, the Oversight Board sided with the user, finding that the post was criticizing the influence of the Chinese state rather than the Chinese people. “As the same word is used in Burmese to refer to a state and people from that state, context is key to understanding the intended meaning,” the board’s decision reads. “A number of factors convinced the Board that the user was not targeting Chinese people, but the Chinese state.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmufkc"&gt;In an interesting twist, no user ever flagged the post as offensive. According to Facebook, the post came under scrutiny after it was “automatically selected as a part of a sample and sent to a human reviewer to be used for classifier training,” part of the company’s ongoing efforts to improve algorithmic flagging. When the reviewer flagged the post as hate speech, it was routed through Facebook’s normal moderation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMIBFH"&gt;Facebook has long struggled with moderation in Myanmar, and has been accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;inflaming widespread racial violence in the country&lt;/a&gt;. After a military coup in February, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;was briefly blocked in the country&lt;/a&gt; and instituted a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264180/facebook-myanmar-coup-response-temporary-high-risk-location"&gt;emergency moderation measures&lt;/a&gt; once access was restored. Still, Facebook moderators &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-is-still-censoring-groups-fighting-the-military-coup-in-myanmar/"&gt;continue to take a hard line against anti-coup groups&lt;/a&gt;, even as a number of groups formerly designated as terrorist organizations have taken power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEqWfU"&gt;The Oversight Board was founded in part as a response to those issues, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/18/17369570/facebook-coalition-myanmar-syria-sri-lanka-moderation-transparency-audit"&gt;concerns from civil society organizations&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s moderators were too friendly with local governments. Officially launched in October, the board does not have any members from Myanmar, but it does include local subject matter experts from Taiwan and Indonesia. This is the board’s fourteenth public decision.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Samsung’s August 2021 Galaxy Unpacked Event</title>

  &lt;p id="WAd3ld"&gt;Apple’s second-gen AirPods are more of a refinement than a revolution, but if you’ve been waiting for the price to come down before jumping on the AirPods bandwagon, now might be the best time to do so. Although they’re often discounted to just shy of $160, Apple’s iconic earbuds and their wireless charging case are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available at Amazon for $130&lt;/a&gt;, the steepest price cut we’ve seen on the in-ears to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klnFI4"&gt;The latest AirPods lack the noise cancellation and flexible design found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, however, they still manage to deliver satisfying sound quality and dependable battery life. Plus, they’re incredibly easy to use with both Apple and Android devices, even if you do lose the double-tap gestures and a bit of convenience with the latter operating system. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The simple black-and-white device is built with streamers in mind, and as such, it features dual 1080p lenses, a built-in stand, and a set of software tools that let you crop your background or remove it entirely if you’re utilizing a green screen. It’s not compatible with the PSVR — Sony &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/09/ps4-games-on-ps5-your-top-questions-answered/"&gt;has confirmed as much&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s still a great way to broadcast yourself alongside your gameplay. Right now, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC5V8L7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $40&lt;/a&gt;, the best price we’ve seen on the Sony peripheral since it launched in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iG8e1L"&gt;While many of us can understand the appeal of traditional books, there’s no denying the appeal of a device like the Kindle Paperwhite. Amazon’s 10th-gen device is a great way to lug your books around town — whether you own one or 1,000 titles — and comes with a crisp 300ppi, six-inch E Ink panel and support for Audible audiobooks. It’s also waterproof and, unlike most modern devices, lasts for weeks on a single charge, meaning you rarely need to worry about grabbing a power brick before heading out the door. Normally $130,  the 8GB, ad-supported version of the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite---waterproof--ad-supported--10th-generation-%2F-%2FA-75574430"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite is available at Target today for $85&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best deals we’ve encountered on the popular e-reader outside of Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What If...? is a playful expansion of Marvel’s multiverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dnV8hLtOfiaoK9mcP81KveS_0Do=/609x0:3231x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709092/103_CBA0100_comp_005_v901.1115.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANPggB"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;is the first of its kind in a lot of ways for the MCU. It’s the first animated project in the interconnected web of movies and TV shows that Marvel Studios has been building out for the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i9EIG"&gt;Instead of focusing on a particular character or storyline, &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;is an anthology series that explores different alternative universes and realities that spin off from Marvel’s established films and shows so far. And it works — after years of lore-heavy movies and shows, the animated show is a refreshing and fun break of bite-sized superhero shenanigans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcK46N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What If...?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and the MCU follow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xDdWGdSgXDMHKDc1623T545bRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774268/101_AGA0230_comp_v904_20201218_r709.00001220.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AEBo31"&gt;That flexibility was one of the most exciting things about the series, head writer A.C. Bradley tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;They’re going to let me write all of them?” she recalls reacting when she was offered the show. “Because so often, women get to write the female heroes, and people of color get to write the people of color heroes, while white men get to write anything they want. So the fact that I was actually going to be able to write Doctor Strange and Iron Man and Killmonger — it was a dream come true. And I knew it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9oLAn"&gt;One episode, for example, reimagines &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The First Avenger&lt;/em&gt; with Peggy Carter receiving the Super Solider Serum instead of Steve Rogers; another sees Yondu accidentally nab T’Challa from Wakanda instead of Peter Quill to become Star Lord. Other episodes seen in the trailer show off a world of Marvel zombies, or Iron Man teaming up with &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; villain Killmonger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l85OoU"&gt;It’s one of the biggest benefits of &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s animated format, which allowed for stories to be told without (as much) consideration for locations, CGI effects, actor availability, and the practical laws of physics that constrain live-action shoots. “[Animation] is a little bit more freeing in the sense that we’re gonna go to this location, this location, this location — as long as we manage our time properly enough where we can create and paint and draw those things, design those things, we can do it,” explains &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; director Bryan Andrews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8RfdM"&gt;Some ideas, though, were too far out even for the initial run of &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;. “There was definitely some stuff that was ... way out there,” says Andrews. “Because at first [Marvel Studios] were like, ‘Yeah, go for it, what do you got?’ And we’re like, ‘Here,’ and they’re like, ‘Yeah, this is all awesome... Some of these maybe we can do later?’” The goal for the first season, he explains, was to try to keep things within the ballpark of the existing MCU. “They just wanted to play it a little bit closer-ish, you know, spinning off moments that we clearly know or can recognize.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mAyAYIuHZQLuz_tdaGTWVpvK1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774269/101_AKA0380_comp_v001.1028.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pHbCyt"&gt;One thing that fans won’t see in &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; — at least for now — is any of the multiversal fallout after Loki and Sylvie’s actions in the season finale of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. That’s for two reasons. The most practical is the fact that &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;actually started production before Loki did, thanks to the longer runway for animation. But the creative team also wanted to avoid tying down the new series too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6d3fs"&gt;“Early on, we had a couple of meetings to talk about what the rules of the multiverse will be,” Bradley explains. “I kind of took a step back and was like, I’m just gonna have fun. I’m not going to write any rules that’re going to step on the TVA. We’re not going to have, you know, The Watcher hanging out with Morbius just yet. We’re just going to show both Marvel and the fans all the weird and wild places that the multiverse can go and just get them excited for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ohCia"&gt;That doesn’t mean that &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; and its alternate-universe takes on classic characters like Captain Carter might not appear in future live-action Marvel projects down the line. “That [decision] belongs to someone with a bigger paycheck,” Bradley jokes. “It’d be cool,” Andrews adds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TG6J8Lh36EOBQTKBub0ntWAFWyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774270/104_EGA0160_comp_v003.1057.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5RZcni"&gt;But even if &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s characters don’t immediately pop up in an upcoming movie or &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;episode, it’ll have an impact on the broader MCU no matter what. Andrews mentioned that the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; team took a look at &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s take on the character as the live-action film was being developed. “And maybe they were a little bit inspired,” says Andrews. “I like to think that they were.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmJZLw"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; starts streaming today on Disney Plus. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now obeying India’s new internet rules, government tells court</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GmWIw3VJamtEvdOKaSt3eA_xNgk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69708732/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1wDpr4"&gt;Twitter is now complying with the Indian government’s new internet rules, a lawyer representing the federal government has told a court in Delhi, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/india-says-twitter-has-now-complied-with-new-internet-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The social media company has now appointed a permanent employee to serve as both chief compliance officer and grievance officer, as well as a nodal officer — three roles required under the new legislation &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter said it appointed the executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614205/twitter-appoints-grievance-compliance-officer-comply-india-rules"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqGMzt"&gt;Although rivals Google and Facebook have reportedly been in compliance &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/"&gt;since May&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter has found itself in a tense standoff with the Indian government over the legislation. In June, the government warned Twitter of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it failed to obey the new rules, and the following month it argued that the social media network had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;lost its legal immunity for its users’ posts&lt;/a&gt; because of its non-compliance. Later that month, Delhi’s high court took issue with Twitter’s attempt to fill two of the legally required positions &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/total-non-compliance-by-twitter-hc/articleshow/84845519.cms"&gt;through a third-party contractor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WehoUm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Government previously said Twitter had lost legal immunity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2viGqA"&gt;The Indian government has also been unhappy with Twitter’s moderation policies. In May, police in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided the social media company’s offices&lt;/a&gt; after it labelled a tweet from a government official as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447379/twitter-india-covid19-politician-tweets-manipulated-media"&gt;manipulated media.&lt;/a&gt;” However, Twitter has been complying with other moderation requests from the government. It suspended over 500 accounts and reduced the visibility of some hashtags &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, some with links to the farmers’ protests, in response to legal threats, and has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;censored tweets critical of India’s handling of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1Ahqx"&gt;While Twitter is now obeying the rules, Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging service has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;sued the Indian government&lt;/a&gt; over parts of the legislation. It objects to a requirement that it trace the origin of messages on its platform, arguing that this is unconstitutional, and will “severely undermine the privacy” of its users.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xbRPab"&gt;NortonLifeLock and Avast are merging in a deal worth more than $8 billion. The deal will see NortonLifelock acquire all of Avast’s shares, and create a much larger cyber security firm. “With this combination, we can strengthen our cyber safety platform and make it available to more than 500 million users,” &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210810005994/en/"&gt;says Vincent Pilette&lt;/a&gt;, NortonLifeLock CEO. “We will also have the ability to further accelerate innovation to transform cyber safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWBoEL"&gt;The combination should lead to antivirus products that include the benefits of Avast’s focus on privacy and NortonLifeLock’s experience in identity, all at a time when cyber security is critical for both consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvVjZ2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;Ransomware is on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, with new high profile cases occurring on what feels like a weekly basis. Gigabyte was hit by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616882/gigabyte-technologies-ransomware-attack-data-leak-112-gb-ransomexx"&gt;ransomware attack earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and a large ransomware attack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;affected customers of Kaseya’s&lt;/a&gt; remote IT management software last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uTt7w"&gt;These attacks can often lead to supply chain attacks, ransomware incidents, or malware that affects regular consumers, too. Hackers managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16325202/ccleaner-hack-malware-security"&gt;hide malware inside system cleaner utility CCleaner in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and consumers are often the victims when databases of credit cards and personal information are leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVIRXN"&gt;Avast, which was founded in the Czech Republic, has been creating software for consumers and small businesses for 11 years, and acquired AVG five years ago. NortonLifeLock is the former consumer side of Symantec, which was left behind after Broadcom acquired Symantec’s enterprise security business two years ago. Norton antivirus has existed in various forms since 1991, and has remained a popular option for consumers for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
