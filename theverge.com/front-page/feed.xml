    <title>Tesla’s next car will seamlessly unlock with UWB, FCC leak suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8I5GbKAWbEj6hTFDNNXzebGoDOQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759439/acastro_180724_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WD5Mi1"&gt;Apple and Samsung have been quietly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;contributing to a new technology to find and  seamlessly unlock your car with your phone&lt;/a&gt;, without pulling a fob out of your pocket — and Tesla may be one of the first with the tech. Tesla is actively working on building UWB into its cars, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXsVLw"&gt;On September 9th, the company submitted six new “products” for the FCC’s consideration, including two key fobs, a security controller, and a number of “endpoints” that would be installed inside the frame and cabin of a vehicle:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RnBE51dFq8WGJXV7QPurNnSscBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276933/image__14_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pNrGoR"&gt;According to the FCC documents, at least three of those products explicitly support UWB communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6NgDD"&gt;What’s more, Tesla’s FCC filing is unusual in that it includes &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AEIM-1614283/Operational-Description/Operation-Description-5073259"&gt;a complete operational description of the technology&lt;/a&gt;, something that’s usually redacted. The highlights: it’s a standards-based implementation of UWB, which means UWB phones from Apple and Samsung should theoretically be compatible, and it’s designed to let you know how far away you are from the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3OjSC"&gt;That’s helpful to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/10/17842136/tesla-key-fob-hack-theft-spoofing-relay"&gt;replay attacks&lt;/a&gt; that try to trick your car into thinking its key fob is closer than it actually is. But it also theoretically unlocks the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;find your car in a crowded parking lot&lt;/a&gt; using your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dazmgirpnE3YWn_I6mj0hynLw5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276974/tesla_uwb_description.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection from Tesla’s operational description of the tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QV831p"&gt;When I spoke to UWB chip supplier NXP last year, company CTO Lars Reger told me that future cars would likely need several of these UWB endpoints inside the car, possibly at the door handles, to properly triangulate your location and know whether you’re inside or outside so, say, your kids won’t be able to turn on the engine if you’re not actually in the cabin. Apparently, Tesla thinks the B-pillars and a piece of fascia might be good places to put those antennas, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCoqL6T7PI462FpkkVk4Q20YJcs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276944/tesla_keyfob.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A drawing of the inside of one of the UWB key fobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pvNXFm"&gt;None of this means that Tesla will necessarily add the tech to its cars, but FCC documents are usually a pretty good sign that it’s not just an experiment. FCC filings are typically one of the last waypoints before a product comes to market, as they’re only required if you’re going to import, sell, or do widespread testing of a radio product in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eivC6h"&gt;Last we checked, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW was the only other automaker&lt;/a&gt; that’s committed to UWB. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s cloud business lost more than $5.5 billion last year, but it’s growing fast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/295I17jeRHbOnMoF-qmIZsbbVrE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759421/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V6ocrJ"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet weathered the tail end of 2020 to &lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2020Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9e991fd"&gt;post better-than-expected earnings&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth quarter of the year. But the bigger story is that Alphabet broke out Google Cloud’s sales for the first time ever, revealing an eye-popping $5.6 billion annual loss last year, but a nearly 50 percent jump in revenue (to $13 billion) compared to 2019. And Google Cloud maintained that growth well into the fourth quarter, when the division generated $3.8 billion in sales. That’s a 46 percent jump from the fourth quarter of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k72qbe"&gt;Those numbers are notable for a few reasons: Google Cloud lags behind the competition, in particular Microsoft’s Azure platform and Amazon’s dominant Amazon Web Services, the CEO of which was just promoted to run the entirety of Amazon now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;co-founder Jeff Bezos is stepping back&lt;/a&gt; into an executive chairman role in a surprise announcement this afternoon. But the division’s fast-growing revenues, second only to the search giant’s core ad business, suggest Google could become a major cloud player and fiercer competitor to Azure and AWS in the years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xlY5q"&gt;The message is now clear: cloud computing is the dominant business for these major tech titans, and the execs who can excel in the cloud industry are stepping in to take the reins of  the entire business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella famously ran Azure before he took over for Steve Ballmer, and Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian was a top exec at Oracle before replacing VMWare co-founder Diane Green in the top Google Cloud role. These are the people running the show at the most important divisions of the most important tech companies, until they get promoted to steer the entire ship apparently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjPMTB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wikipedia introduces new Universal Code of Conduct to fight harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eC6j_wVvyGSQsIpyd-p5YSwhE7s=/131x0:1904x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759366/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.55.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JrFvxD"&gt;Wikipedia has &lt;a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2021/02/02/wikipedia-embraces-first-of-its-kind-universal-code-of-conduct/"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Universal_Code_of_Conduct/Policy_text"&gt;Universal Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; that looks to create a global standard for the site and ensure a “diverse, inclusive, and accessible” community of contributors, continuing its efforts to fight harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyUjKb"&gt;The formal code of conduct — like many Wikimedia projects — was a crowdsourced project, with over 1,500 volunteers from around the world contributing. It’s intentionally designed to be relatively short and easily comprehensible to users, measuring in at a brisk 1,600 words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzn6Ec"&gt;Broadly speaking, the new code of conduct is broken down into two categories: positive behavior that’s expected from users, editors, and Wikimedia employees, and unacceptable behavior that the company looks to discourage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBrDUY"&gt;Expected behavior includes having mutual respect for others, engaging in constructive editing, and respecting things like personal pronouns for other contributors. The code of conduct also encourages users to help support each other on projects and to mentor new editors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ammhv4"&gt;On the flip side of things, the code of conduct explicitly calls out harassment — be it insults, sexual harassment, threatening language, doxxing, or bad faith arguments — along with “any behavior intended primarily to intimidate, outrage, or upset a person.” Abuse of power is similarly banned, as is content vandalism, hate speech, and “deliberately introducing biased, false, inaccurate, or inappropriate content” to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouR130"&gt;The code of conduct &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21269482/wikimedia-foundation-anti-harassment-code-of-conduct-vote"&gt;follows the company’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; of plans to enact more formal policies against harassment and inappropriate behavior on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GvWRro"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wikimedia is writing new policies to fight Wikipedia harassment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21269482/wikimedia-foundation-anti-harassment-code-of-conduct-vote"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="J4wVzD"&gt;The new Universal Code of Conduct is just the first part of the company’s efforts to define encouraged and unacceptable behavior on Wikipedia. Defining bad conduct is a good place to start, but right now, Wikimedia has yet to codify any universal policies for what happens when bad actors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; harass other users or spread misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSa8OA"&gt;Wikimedia is already working on that second phase of the Universal Code of Conduct, which will establish how both local and regional Wikipedia projects will enforce the new requirements and any consequences for those who break those rules. But the company is still in the early stages here — that part of the project &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Universal_Code_of_Conduct#Timeline"&gt;likely won’t be complete&lt;/a&gt; until late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhF6rP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will have a new CEO as Jeff Bezos transitions to executive chair later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/myObr0yaB2Nz7wXhl62wGk1FbY4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68759143/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NzQvvY"&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees"&gt;will step down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; and transition to a new position at the company as executive chair of the Amazon board in Q3 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=Dm1MOGqy6o4"&gt;Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt;, who currently serves as CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), will replace Bezos as Amazon CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA4c8H"&gt;“Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it’s consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it’s hard to put attention on anything else,” &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees"&gt;commented Bezos in an email&lt;/a&gt; announcing the change. “As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and my other passions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YgOzz1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bezos is stepping back to better focus on projects like the Bezos Earth Fund and Blue Origin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw3beK"&gt;Bezos has served as Amazon’s CEO since he founded the company in 1994, and he has presided over the e-commerce giant as it grew from an online bookstore into one of the most dominant technology companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4YWwd"&gt;Under Bezos’ stewardship, Amazon has come to rule over internet commerce, established itself as a backbone of the infrastructure of the modern web through its Amazon Web Services products, built a subscription empire around its Amazon Prime services, launched popular technology products like the Echo and Kindle lines of devices, and even started dabbling in physical retail through grocery stores and an acquisition of Whole Foods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46vEDx"&gt;Bezos has also prospered as head of the company, with skyrocketing wealth that (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;until just a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;) made him the single richest human on Earth, with a net worth of nearly $180 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaoVr4"&gt;Bezos’ transition to executive chairman of Amazon’s board will mean he’ll be slightly more removed from the day-to-day business of running the nearly $1.7 trillion company, allowing him to focus his “energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” Those projects will include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;$10 billion Bezos Earth Fund&lt;/a&gt;, which Bezos established last year, and Blue Origins, his aerospace firm, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509198/blue-origin-new-shepard-test-launch-nasa-payload-watch-live-time"&gt;recently resumed test flights&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOC4VT"&gt;Jassy is a familiar face at the company, having joined back in 1997. He has led the Amazon Web Services team since it was founded in 2003 and was named the CEO of AWS in 2016. The choice of Jassy — who has headed Amazon’s cloud service business since the beginning — over a retail or hardware executive is a telling one for Amazon’s priorities as a company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2p1y8"&gt;Amazon’s cloud business is a huge part of the company (and the internet at large, to the point where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;AWS outages&lt;/a&gt; can take down whole swaths of internet for hours), and its new leadership choice reflects that. It’s also a parallel to other major tech CEOs, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5169852/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo"&gt;Microsoft’s Satya Nadella&lt;/a&gt;, who was similarly an instrumental part of the company’s cloud and server business before taking charge of Microsoft in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1OlOh"&gt;It’ll still be some time before Jassy takes over, though — Bezos isn’t set to transition to his new role until Q3 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZS0tc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s HarmonyOS appears to just be a forked version of Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="huawei" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5WlBTNUf0uld9UdFsx5duTpxpE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758861/VRG_ILLO_1777_Huawei_004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4bmwHs"&gt;HarmonyOS is Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798251/huawei-harmonyos-hongmengos-smartphones-internet-of-things-operating-system-android"&gt;alternative operating system&lt;/a&gt; that was created after the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;banned in the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;lost its Android license&lt;/a&gt;. The reality is the operating system is less of a new alternative and more of a slapdash fork of Android 10, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;a new report from Ron Amadeo at &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvu2dR"&gt;HarmonyOS was initially pitched as a wholly distinct OS from Android and iOS, something that would be just as at home on smart home appliances (like the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873710/huawei-vision-4k-tv-announced-features-mate-30-pro-event"&gt;Honor Vision TV&lt;/a&gt;) as it would on smartphones. The announcement was a hopeful promise that losing access to US businesses wouldn’t stop Huawei from innovating, but Amadeo’s experience with the beta highlights some disappointing discoveries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eujOB3"&gt;Getting developer access requires a two-day background check that includes sending copies of your passport, personal ID, and credit card to Huawei&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yqieKq"&gt;You don’t actually run the beta OS in its emulator; it’s streamed to you, Google Stadia-style, from (presumably) a phone running the beta in China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iwqJcC"&gt;Most importantly, HarmonyOS seems to be a fork of Android 10 with the word “Android” find-and-replaced with “Harmony”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow4yn5"&gt;HarmonyOS was likely always going to be most popular in China, but the fact that the new OS appears to be a continuation of Huawei’s EMUI skin with potentially slower access to Android updates through the Open Source Android Project is a major strike against it being used anywhere else. It might be good enough to not offend the US government and satisfy Chinese authorities, but quick text edits and an invasive application process do not an appetizing operating system make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXXBHz"&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;Amadeo’s whole deep dive&lt;/a&gt; of detective work dissecting the beta, along with some jabs at Huawei’s fluff-filled developer documentation for a hypothetical “super virtual device,” over at&lt;em&gt; Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A few options for each platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZkrThV"&gt;If you’re shopping for a gaming headset, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of options. While there are some great ones out there, it’s easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn’t work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that’s just uncomfortable. Knowing a thing or two about headphones might aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIb46"&gt;For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate without a dongle via Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol. They’ll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases. Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless dongle, it’ll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console’s TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox. It’s best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly, or else there’s a good chance you’ll run into some compatibility issues. Of course, you can eliminate most of the guesswork by buying a wired gaming headset instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JNU3"&gt;This guide focuses on newer options that you’re more likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online. Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKGdzA"&gt;You’ll find a few categories below, including the &lt;strong&gt;best multiplatform wireless headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock, the &lt;strong&gt;best Xbox wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;best wired gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="McEjqN"&gt;Best multiplatform wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QxhUUV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="riIMhm"&gt;The HyperX Cloud II Wireless makes an excellent first impression before even turning it on for the first time. Its headband expands to fit a range of head sizes, and the ear cups rest gently around my ears without nary a pinching feeling around my cranium. The cups can be stretched even further than my head requires, which gives me faith that they’ll be a durable pick for years to come. This is the downfall of many otherwise good gaming headsets. HyperX nailed the fit, and it also aced a lot of other winning elements with the Cloud II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7HwnV"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless boasts a balanced sound that delivers just enough gusto for every scenario. It’s not the right choice if you want bass to rattle your head, but it’s good if you want your headset to be just as enjoyable to use for gaming as it is for music and voice chats. I also like that the Cloud II Wireless has USB-C charging, and its battery life is long-lasting. HyperX claims 30 hours of battery per charge, and the headset lived up to that mark during my testing. The wireless range of the headset and the included 2.4GHz wireless receiver are also great, suffering no drops anywhere in my apartment. It even remained stable when I stood on the other side of a wall or window, each being about 25 feet away from the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iHCKN5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568047" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlqrJU"&gt;Compared to competitors in this price range, the Cloud II plays it simple when it comes to the buttons, and the result is that it’s easy to learn how to master the layout. And if all the functions you require are a volume dial, power button, and a microphone mute button, this will suit you better than other headsets that try to fit too many buttons onto ear cups. On the other hand, it’s missing a game and chat audio mix dial that easily lets you fine-tune your game audio with your pals chatting on Discord or while streaming. You can do this manually by clicking a few windows, but other headsets mentioned below make this easier to do. This headset also makes it easy to turn on mic monitoring to hear yourself talk (and hear things happening around you) by simply holding the mute button to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQCvSA"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless doesn’t have an overwhelming lead over the major players in the space, like Logitech, SteelSeries, and Razer. In fact, it may get the boot if a similarly priced and comparably cozy model with wired 3.5mm connectivity and Bluetooth support comes along. But since that has yet to happen, HyperX’s flagship wireless headset is the easy choice for PC, PlayStation, and Switch gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9IDJD"&gt;Here’s what the microphone sounds like on the HyperX Cloud II Wireless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="DcjeD9"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/tab2gajv/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YdssKP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DSU9zw"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21404415/astro-a20-gen-2-next-gen-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-wireless-headset"&gt;Astro A20 Gen 2&lt;/a&gt; ($120)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiplatform but requires an extra $20 adapter to work with both PS and Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMAE19hTSmz0CsTc9TF32Tv1bnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21830232/Aquarius_Blue_Desk_Stage_2_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SrrIBJ"&gt;Astro’s new A20 for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles is unique in that it’s one of the few cross-platform wireless headsets out there. Buying just one of them (in either the PlayStation blue / white colorway or the Xbox green / white) can let you connect to either system. However, there’s a small catch: you’ll need to buy an additional $20 wireless adapter to let it connect to the console opposite of your headset’s color styling (each headset includes one adapter). Despite the string attached, this functionality makes it an appealing option for people who will be getting both the PS5 and Xbox Series X or S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntDrFp"&gt;Whichever platform you’ll use with this headset, Astro’s A20 Gen 2 is packed with more buttons and features than the Cloud II Wireless above. On the ear cups, Astro managed to also fit in a dedicated button for switching the equalizer to your liking to add or subtract bass and vocal clarity. There’s also a game and chat audio mixing dial to help you find the right balance of sounds between your apps. I love this feature, and I also dig that it has a good amount of mic monitoring, so you can hear a little bit of the outside world. This headset’s microphone doesn’t detach. Instead, you’ll just move it up to mute it, which gets it out of your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4o0BxC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j1b0Ap"&gt;Astro’s latest headset checks a lot of boxes considering its $120 price. The A20 Gen 2 doesn’t quite reach the comfort of HyperX’s model above, as it hangs most of its weight at the top of your head. It doesn’t get painful as the ear cups don’t pinch, but it can result in some fatigue after a while (on top of some very bad headset hair). Also, while I appreciated the EQ button that cycles between sound profiles, the sound quality on the whole isn’t as balanced and punchy as the Cloud II Wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpjga"&gt;But speaking on its features alone, it’s a more affordable runner-up choice if you want better console compatibility (even though it comes at a $20 cost to have both Xbox and PlayStation support), and a headset that has a physical game and chat mixing dial. I found the wireless range of the A20 Gen 2 and its included wireless receiver to be quite good. My studio apartment is about 40 feet long and 15 feet wide, the headset kept a solid connection throughout. I was even able to run some trash outside without a drop. Astro claims up to 15 meters of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EG0ble"&gt;Here’s what the microphone sounds like on the Astro A20 Gen 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oaztJ1"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/f2wswhgb/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C dongle that ships with the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless makes it an alluring choice for Switch gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyHuQL"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="H0bxb3"&gt;The amount of wireless gaming headsets is blossoming, and I expect to make an update to this section on a regular basis — perhaps more regularly than the sections below. As such, there are plenty of other options that didn’t quite make the cut as the “best” but are still pretty good in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1RkbU"&gt;Logitech’s G733 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130&lt;/a&gt;) came very close to being the runner-up headset. It’s comfortable with breathable ear cups, it has good sound for the price, and the vertical strips of LEDs actually look sharp. It misses the mark by not allowing a wired listening mode and for not having a game-chat audio mix dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJyiFA"&gt;The G Pro X Lightspeed (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081PP4CB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=19e702d2b62186465b570dcca369fd9f&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200&lt;/a&gt;), also from Logitech, nails the basics of having good build quality, USB-C charging, and punchy sound quality. It goes a step beyond the G733 with better noise isolation. However, its heavy build wore uncomfortably on my head after a few hours and I don’t think it offers enough features to justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5uWQ"&gt;The Audeze Penrose (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Wireless-Playstation-Low-Latency-Bluetooth/dp/B08D9PBR9X?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=6e608f6933710a8443e333369413294a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299&lt;/a&gt;) has incredible sound quality, along with a plethora of features, like Bluetooth support for connecting a phone and console simultaneously, USB-C for charging, and a 3.5mm port for wired listening. However, considering its high price, it’s not nearly comfortable enough for my head size — it is heavy and too tight — and I think it is likely to wear heavily on other heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgokdG"&gt;If you’re mostly into playing games on the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 1 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best choices out there when it comes to ease of use. It isn’t a super comfortable headset, as it lacks the company’s ski band-style headband that distributes weight gently on your head. But it ships with a USB-C wireless receiver that can plug directly into the Switch or Switch Lite. Connectivity is strong, and audio quality is quite good given the headset’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X96DFR5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=2109b1c7eddf9e19cf8013a2da0e4ba9&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kVCQQA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j1QvYC"&gt;Best Xbox-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21545683/razer-kaira-pro-xbox-wireless-gaming-headset-series-x-s-one-pc-microsoft-usb-c"&gt;Razer Kaira Pro&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5FyUOH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Bluetooth-ready devices, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kaira Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FuzXKAnHOyvPWuGUIY0MkDYOf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22011747/kairapro1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="66Orpz"&gt;Razer’s new Kaira Pro for Xbox consoles and PC is one of the company’s most impressive headsets yet. It narrowly loses the matchup to the HS75 XB listed below when it comes to sound quality, but it leaps ahead with more features. It includes the option to connect to devices via Bluetooth so you can listen to music, podcasts, or take calls while you game on Xbox or PC. The Kaira Pro also has other features I expect to have in a wireless gaming headset, like USB-C charging and a handy game and chat dial for a customized audio mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXqF7"&gt;A particularly cool feature here are the built-in microphones that kick in when you’re connected to a device over Bluetooth. While the Kaira Pro includes a detachable boom mic for use with gaming on your console, these additional microphones are useful for on-the-go voice calls when you don’t want to be seen using the bigger microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hIYdw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568243" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtxXA"&gt;As I mentioned before, the Kaira Pro sounds great, but it’s not quite as robust when put up against the Corsair model below. If you’re a stickler for crisp sound quality and better positional audio, opt for the runner-up since they’re open-back and not closed like Razer’s headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEhXsi"&gt;Razer’s headset looks and fits mostly like your average set of over-ear headphones, which is ideal since you can easily use it in that fashion with its Bluetooth function. The Kaira Pro’s build quality is better than I expected, particularly when it comes to comfort. It places equal pressure on the top of your head and around your ears, feeling just tight enough to keep the sound in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVMs6W"&gt;As I’ve found with most headsets made to take advantage of the Xbox wireless protocol, range can be an issue. In my studio apartment, I started hearing audio crackling when I was just 15 feet away from the wireless adapter plugged into my PC, but your mileage may vary. Despite the convenience of not having to use a dongle with your Xbox console, I think I’d prefer to have one if it means better wireless range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCR4fx"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Razer Kaira Pro sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rqp5TG"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/v41rvhkk/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Mo7J1Z"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cgE2YH"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525271/corsair-hs75-xb-wireless-review-pc-xbox-specs-features-price"&gt;Corsair HS75 XB Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qgNCwe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DEYyCC8eHCj_067ddJD309hdr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21977171/cfaulkner_201020_4249_0005.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="orJF4d"&gt;If you’re locked to team Xbox, or find yourself switching between PC (with Microsoft’s Xbox wireless adapter) and your console, Corsair’s HS75 XB Wireless is currently the headset that I recommend if you want superb audio quality. It’s a $150 model that surprised me with impressive sound and a styling that looks like a set of premium open-back headphones. In addition to a bombastic sound that, at least for a moment, made me forget that I wasn’t using my Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless headphones, it’s comfortable to wear for hours. These look far heavier in images than they feel on my head, and I was delighted that they didn’t give off much of a pinching sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGpDXo"&gt;It’s usually the small details that win me over in a headset, and in the HS75 XB, it’s the symmetrical button layout. Thus, the learning curve for mastering the buttons is low, and this model has everything I need in a pinch, including a game and chat audio dial, volume dial, and an easy way to mute the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7H0E2q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568253" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obhus1"&gt;Corsair’s 20-hour battery life claims for the HS75 XB are a tad lower than competing models. But its USB-C charging at least makes recharging faster and more simple to do than plugging in via Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN4Uu"&gt;I mentioned this with the Razer Kaira Pro, but wireless range is an issue here. Your living arrangement might yield different results, but breaking line of sight with the Xbox Wireless Adapter plugged into my PC or straying more than 15 or so feet away made the audio begin to crackle. I think I’d prefer if Corsair simply made its own dongle that was compatible with Xbox than going this route. Still, this is a great headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2FmFG"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Corsair HS75 XB Wireless sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0CvhdO"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/fr05lrgf/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ix1BVV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BO7lTo"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ySUxNR"&gt;The options above deliver the best experience for the money, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other solid options out there. We tested other wireless gaming headsets from manufacturers like Turtle Beach and LucidSound. Though, there was usually one or more deal-breakers about each model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rOlW"&gt;For instance, the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Premium-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Console/dp/B08D45WDR7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=89ece5e076095169f2188aa3e8230262&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) sounds great and has USB-C charging, but its fit is tight and it’s uncomfortable to wear after a while. Your experience may vary depending on your head size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9V3HE"&gt;The LucidSound LS15X (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MMSW147/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=83aa2896b7a6f9de3c8cac25250149e1&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99&lt;/a&gt;) and SteelSeries Arctis 7X Wireless (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7x&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) are also good in some ways, but not good enough that I suggest you seek them out over the others above. Both offer better comfort than the Stealth 700 Gen 2, but they’re relatively light on extra features and they charge via Micro USB, which is just inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fD8Ib3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NvDGre"&gt;Best PlayStation-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731191871792355944" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Pulse 3D&lt;/a&gt; ($100)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nz0scw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PS5, PS4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony Pulse 3D headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOf5ce2ocE5G4xWmRzB8Os1tqq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276836/pulse3d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony Pulse 3D gaming headset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KWlvfW"&gt;Sony’s $99 Pulse 3D wireless headset for the PS4 and PS5 is a surprisingly feature-packed headset that’s also one of the most comfortable options on this list. I’m a sucker for well-fitting headsets, and the bungie-style headband Sony supplies is fantastic. Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band. It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it’s on my head. Just a note: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avxDnB"&gt;The Pulse 3D’s headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5’s Tempest sound engine. Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off. Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5’s &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; to be a great showcase for it. In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear. For a more relaxing experience, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; sounds great, too. There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems. Games that don’t support 3D audio still sound good but are not quite as enthralling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcK8B"&gt;For a $99 headset, the positional audio quality is better than I expected, as is the sound balance. There’s not an overwhelming amount of bass or tinny highs — everything is delivered delicately. I like that because it helps prevent fatigue during long play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="63qvPj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;one of the most comfortable options on this list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbTnpB"&gt;Almost everything else about this headset is impressive for the price as well. The controls are a little more intuitively laid-out than Sony’s previous model for the PS4. The Pulse 3D features a tactile rocker that lets you balance game audio with your chat, and there are separate buttons just for adjusting volume. I like that there’s a dedicated switch for turning on mic monitoring, which helps to funnel in just a little bit of outside sound (including your own voice) through its built-in pinhole microphones, so you’re not totally isolated while wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiOAWK"&gt;Speaking of mic quality, these kinds of mics are certainly not as good as what you’d get with most boom microphones. For instance, some “s” and “f” sounds are often muddled. But on the whole, it’s serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHWw0L"&gt;The Pulse 3D supports listening via an included 3.5mm cable or wirelessly when paired up to the 2.4GHz receiver. What’s new here is support for USB-C charging. Sony is by no means the only company putting USB-C in headsets these days, but it’s nevertheless nice to use the same cord that charges your DualSense to recharge this headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb182h"&gt;Sony claims 13 hours of wireless performance per charge. The headset actually landed between about 10 and 12 hours during my testing, which is an underwhelming result. Of course, this is less of an issue if you’re connecting it to a power source each time you stop gaming for the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="UW01so"&gt;Best wired gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439699/bose-quiet-comfort-35-ii-noise-canceling-gaming-headset-pc-bluetooth-price"&gt;Bose QC 35 II gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MPJACg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bose quiet comfort 35 II gaming headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pciMgUYAGo-xYKzVk_U8Kf6fy80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21885342/boseqc35iigame2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uWo9Sy"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II gaming headset offers the most features, but at the highest cost of any other headset featured in this guide. Despite costing more than an Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch, this set delivers on value. It comes with the QC 35 II wireless noise-canceling headphones that can be used on the go with Bluetooth and wired 3.5mm connectivity. There are no other options I’ve listed that have a noise cancellation feature and support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also among the most comfortable, lightweight options on this list. You’ll know when the QC 35 II is on your head, but it doesn’t pinch or press hard against your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRyE2r"&gt;Used as a gaming headset, either connected via USB through its included desktop controller or via 3.5mm, the QC 35 II makes for a lightweight, comfortable option with a microphone attachment that’s easy to use. This model offers the best noise isolation (even without the battery-draining noise cancellation feature switched on) in any headset I’ve tested. Noise isolation is usually something most headsets fumble, but with this one you’ll be able to better hear footsteps and other crucial noises that might decide the match. With noise cancellation switched on, it really does make everything around you very quiet — perfect for boosting the immersion in your games. The desktop controller I mentioned above adds more features, including a nice volume dial and button that adjusts the intensity of mic monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtgrRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ZNt7"&gt;The $329 price is high, but if you value noise cancellation and want to have a headset you can easily take on the road (and that has ear cups that can swivel and fold into a compact size), check this out. It’s worth noting that current owners of the QC 35 II headphones unfortunately won’t be able to easily acquire the microphone attachment, as Bose isn’t selling it separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gR255W"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Bose QC 35 II gaming headset sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uYnXKd"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/mo1cvshf/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oHaXwr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YUH1Gy"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;Razer BlackShark V2 + sound card&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U8pXiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer BlackShark V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xx8tXQweQhnns7y4ri_KSFBcyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20782512/blacksharkv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ejvb7t"&gt;Razer’s updated BlackShark headset is my runner-up choice for a wired headset you can buy. It’s $100, yet it features a similar design and general feature set to Razer’s $200 wireless V2 Pro model. That also means it’s just as comfortable, with a plush headband and breathable ear cups that don’t apply too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOPElj"&gt;This model’s build materials are a step above the $59 BlackShark V2 X when it comes to being breathable, and it includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;USB sound card&lt;/a&gt;, into which the headset’s 3.5mm end plugs. With it, you’ll get slightly better sound quality. Also, using the sound card allows you to use THX spatial sound in Razer’s Synapse 3 software, which I found to be a nice value add but not particularly alluring in practice. Razer says it’s adding spatial audio profiles for popular games moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of ways to utilize the sound card, if this feature strikes your interest. Regardless of your interest, you’ll also be able to plug the headset’s 3.5mm end into a variety of controllers and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gz2EXW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568257" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgFwUw"&gt;Something that stood out to me during testing is that finding a comfortable fit took almost no effort. And while many headsets are comfortable enough to wear for hours, I didn’t want to take the BlackShark V2 off my head. Another nice touch is its volume knob, which affords fine-tune adjustments that dials don’t usually provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63tBlJ"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the BlackShark V2 sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uuOTZp"&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/cyhm0nyy/widget" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TY1VFp"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ryiJOs"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXkzte"&gt;If you’re committed to getting a wired headset, there are some really interesting options out there. I got to test a few other headsets that, while not as good as the models above, might be better for your needs or budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIgFJ"&gt;For something less expensive than Bose’s headset that still sounds good, HyperX’s Cloud Revolver 7.1 wired headset for a PC (&lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets/cloud-revolver-gaming-headset"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) might be worth checking out, particularly if you’re looking for something comfortable. This model is just as comfy to wear as the Cloud II Wireless, my top wireless pick at the top of this article. Sound quality isn’t at the same level, though, and I’d recommend holding off on any purchases until the price drops, as the package here is fairly light on features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Uaxxs"&gt;Creative Audio’s SXFI Gamer (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNPSZVP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=d134f5aa0a291f3f43cb53e066c7546d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130&lt;/a&gt;) is a USB-C wired headset that has a simple design and a sound profile that’s pleasant to listen to for games, voice chat, or music. My complaints with this one are on the minor side, with its sizing adjustments not holding very well and its voice prompts sometimes being confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QJEfi2"&gt;The Sennheiser EPOS 601 (&lt;a href="https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/gaming/products/gsp-601-gaming-headset-1000413"&gt;$220&lt;/a&gt;) nails the fundamentals, with great sound and a quality microphone. But the ear cups are too darn big, and that excess spills into its overall design. It’s also too expensive for a relatively basic wired headset that doesn’t offer but a couple of special features, like replaceable sidearm plates and a twist-to-adjust volume knob.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus’ App Lab offers a new way to try early access VR apps without sideloading</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIn1rh3sabVlwtky9T4RAt_hhxY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758854/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KUK8g0"&gt;Oculus has detailed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Flatest-oculus-quest-update-fosters-developer-creativity-with-app-lab-and-connects-people-with-messenger%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F2%2F22262794%2Foculus-update-app-lab-vr-early-access-sideloading#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;what’s coming in its v25 software update&lt;/a&gt; for Quest and Quest 2 headsets. The most notable change for both developers and users is App Lab, a new method for distributing in-development VR apps that doesn’t require Oculus Store approval and also doesn’t require sideloading. Think of this software as the equivalent of early access for VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0hwXX"&gt;Oculus shared in its press release that it wants to keep the bar for quality high for its store, so it’s splintering off App Lab apps from its main storefront. But it wants to foster a community where developers can openly and easily share their in-progress creations with Quest owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPsKo5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Something like App Lab has been long awaited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHUwxr"&gt;After a developer &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-app-lab-a-new-way-to-distribute-oculus-quest-apps/?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=latest-oculus-quest-update-fosters-developer-creativity-with-app-lab-and-connects-people-with-messenger"&gt;submits their App Lab app to Oculus&lt;/a&gt;, users can access it easily through a URL, or they can be found by searching for their exact name in the Oculus Store. SideQuest, a popular site that hosts applications and games that can be sideloaded onto the Quest headset, &lt;a href="https://sidequestvr.com/news/2374/oculus-app-lab-integration-official-support-on-sidequest"&gt;will also host App Lab apps&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably, many of the apps and games hosted there might soon get App Lab support, making it easier for people to try some of the experiences hosted there without sideloading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmfoLg"&gt;App Lab grants developers the ability to broadly open their apps up to the general public to try or to generate unique keys if you want to only allow certain people to access them. And from the user’s perspective, any App Labs apps you download can be found in your Quest library of apps and games.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="App Lab" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abM-VG3F3R7dtxw2t6S9Vyz_aA4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276707/145439647_859112401546343_5034401412607724516_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Oculus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These apps have debuted on App Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oL3dxJ"&gt;Oculus says that over 10 App Lab titles have launched, including the experiences pictured above. Though, &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-app-lab-a-new-way-to-distribute-oculus-quest-apps/"&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt; presented an error when I clicked them at the time of publishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbnKnN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/release-notes/?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=latest-oculus-quest-update-fosters-developer-creativity-with-app-lab-and-connects-people-with-messenger"&gt;Several other features&lt;/a&gt; are coming in this update, including Messenger for VR, allowing you to keep Facebook chats going while you’re immersed in your Quest headset. The Oculus release notes also mention “Stationary Guardian 2.0,” bringing some more quality-of-life improvements for when you want to safely use VR while in a stationary location instead of using roomscale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYhE3d"&gt;Whether you use VR software in roomscale or stationary mode, Oculus’ Passthrough shortcut is now easier to access and no longer buried in its experiments settings. The feature allows you to see your surroundings through the Quest or Quest 2’s outward-facing cameras by double-tapping the section where the headband meets the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOIXfr"&gt;In case you’ve ever wanted to pair a Bluetooth mouse to your Quest headset, you’ll soon be able to do that, too. To find this feature, head to settings, click “Experimental Features,” and you should find it there soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LG Wing and Pixel 5 have been cleared to use coveted C-band 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3zDe2Rw_CMqlm1rwozgZR-9J9sM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758421/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The unusual LG Wing is one of only a few devices approved to use C-band 5G so far.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M945v"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; owners have something to look forward to: the Federal Communications Commission has approved these devices to use faster C-band 5G frequencies, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/lg-wing-google-pixel-5-get-a-new-future-with-c-band-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; tipster&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones have joined an exclusive company made up of some of the first devices approved to use the new frequencies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; phones and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt; are the only others that currently offer support for these frequencies in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RoS9N"&gt;C-band will deliver a much-needed speed boost to 5G in the US, particularly for Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T customers. Currently, their nationwide networks rely mostly on slower low-band spectrum. This swath of so-called mid-band frequencies went up for auction at the end of 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/c-band-bidding-wraps-at-%248091b-/d/d-id/766706"&gt;US carriers bid a record $80.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; to secure blocks of spectrum for their use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xvx0Jx"&gt;These frequencies won’t be available for use until late 2021 / early 2022, but LG and Google appear to be getting ahead of the curve. With this FCC approval, the companies can offer software updates to enable the use of C-band frequencies on these specific devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MNKs3z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G: everything you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="em7U0J"&gt;As things stand now, not every 5G phone works with every kind of 5G frequency. Some devices, particularly budget models, support only low- and mid-band. Others are also compatible with high-band like Verizon’s Ultra Wideband, which the carrier indicates by selling certain models branded as “UW.” C-band will complicate things even more; manufacturers need to get FCC approval to retroactively add support to their existing devices so they can take advantage of the new spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLZ6OY"&gt;No doubt C-band will be a welcome addition to 5G networks in the US, but it’s one more thing to be aware of if you plan to buy a new phone this year. T-Mobile customers won’t need to worry as much since that carrier’s network already uses other mid-band frequencies. But if you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T and plan on hanging on to your phone for a few years, it’s worth getting a device that either supports C-band now or will in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfC8rr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z84kAx"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxX7FH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Audeze Penrose gaming headset nails almost everything except for comfort</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great sound, full of features, but the fit might be a deal-breaker&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SiQb3F"&gt;The Audeze Penrose has almost everything I want in a wireless gaming headset. Its high-end planar magnetic drivers deliver rich, balanced sound quality that’s easily superior to other models I’ve tested recently. It’s feature-packed, too, with individual volume and microphone levels, USB-C charging, a couple of options for wired connectivity (USB-C or 3.5mm), as well as support for simultaneous Bluetooth 5.0 audio connections. As a gaming headset, it’s stacked — which it should be for something that costs $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXjG6j"&gt;After reviewing a headset, I usually can’t wait to return to the familiar, plushy, warm-sounding cans of my own Sony WH-1000XM3, but the Penrose is a joy to listen to. Game audio sounds punchy without being over-delivered, I don’t need to blast the volume to hear subtle details, and even though this headset doesn’t have active noise cancellation, I was almost convinced it did due to a combined effort from its closed-back design and thick ear pads that yield better-than-average sound isolation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qNNz9Hrb4jtaK6kZ_hvUzPfizE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275062/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, you can connect via USB-C or 3.5mm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8zGl9"&gt;The particular model that Audeze sent along for review is made to be compatible with PS4 and PS5 consoles and with PCs via its 2.4GHz wireless receiver. (It also works with the Nintendo Switch, even though that isn’t advertised.) It’s clad in black with blue trim to signify which family of consoles it was designed for. The company also makes an Xbox version called the Penrose X that has green trim, and that model’s unique receiver has a two-position toggle switch that lets it work with Microsoft’s proprietary wireless tech in one mode, then on PC in the other. Otherwise, it’s the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgctql"&gt;There’s a caveat to all of this goodness: I didn’t find the Penrose to be comfortable to wear for even short gaming sessions. I never forgot that it was on my head because I felt squeezed the whole time, and that’s a deal-breaker for me. I should note that I have a somewhat large head, so it’s likely that people with smaller noggins won’t feel as compressed. But I imagine that its 320g weight would feel heavy on just about any noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxKz7E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10315655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzqb6"&gt;Other recent headsets I’ve liked, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, are 320g as well, but its weight is distributed much better. I barely notice that model on my head even after some time has passed, and that’s what I’m personally looking for in a headset. Granted, HyperX Cloud II doesn’t have hefty 100mm magnetic drivers like the Penrose does, which amounts to better sound at the expense of heavier ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7DXy4"&gt;I’d give Audeze more of a pass if the Penrose was an original design, but it’s almost identical to the $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17118960/audezes-mobius-headphones-gaming-3d-audio"&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/a&gt; released in 2018, which had enhanced 3D sound processing and head-tracking. (The Penrose lacks both features.) It also looks like the $299 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171636/hyperx-cloud-orbit-gaming-headphones-planar-magnetic-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;HyperX Cloud Orbit released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which features Audeze’s planar magnetic drivers, and much of the Mobius’ design. The Penrose’s build quality is still exceptional, but I wish the company had put more focus on refining the design, particularly as it relates to comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuHb_pwekMQ2d6QnzvrhmGq2I5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275059/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dials look easy to access, but they aren’t so simple to discern without looking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TrMLtb"&gt;As for the controls, the layout isn’t unintuitive, but some of the buttons don’t stand out enough when you’re feeling for them — specifically, the volume and mic level dials. Those are integrated into the backside of the left ear cup, and they’re raised, as opposed to being built flush into the ear cup, to make feeling for them easier (at least, that seems like the goal). Those raised hunks of plastic actually make the thin dials tough to discern and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A5xe0"&gt;Otherwise, it’s easy to take advantage of the Penrose’s main features, like being able to mute the mic with the switch on the left ear cup’s outer shell, or switching wireless modes with the multifunction button near where the detachable mic plugs in. The Penrose isn’t the only headset that lets you connect to a phone via Bluetooth while also being connected to your game console, but I think the execution here is great. If you get a call while you’re gaming, tapping the Penrose’s power button will pick up or hang up. (Careful, though: Audeze says your voice will be transmitted over both Bluetooth and wireless channels.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvOpfF"&gt;Battery life is lackluster. I’ve gotten around 10 hours of use per charge, whereas some less expensive competing models in our headset buying guide offer 30 or more hours per charge. It’s not great considering the price, but it’s not a huge issue for me since I usually leave my headset at my PC or PS5 charging overnight anyway (made easier by the reversible USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6_9U36Qf_BPATpxodGu3W0L3GQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275063/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wireless receiver is shaped like a thumb drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IVNi7"&gt;It’s easy for me to recommend the Penrose based on its features and sound quality alone, but comfort plays an equally large role for me — and that’s where this headset is lacking the most. It’s a shame that the fit is so fatiguing because it’s really the only deal-breaker. Otherwise, the Penrose could be an ideal addition to any gamer’s life, especially those who want a headset that can connect to multiple devices simultaneously. Just heed the warning that, for certain head shapes and for people sensitive to wearing hefty headphones, it might not fit your head very well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>McDonald’s is testing the ‘McPlant’ burger in Denmark and Sweden</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkT16B"&gt;McDonald’s new plant-based burger, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/11/9/21556647/mcdonalds-plant-based-burger-is-the-mcplant-chicken-sandwich-wars-2021"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, has debuted for a trial run in Denmark and Sweden, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/mcdonald-s-quietly-rolls-out-mcplant-burger-in-test-markets"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed the McPlant, the burger features a patty made from pea and rice proteins, which was co-developed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564094/beyond-meat-new-burgers-plant-based-two-types-juicier-less-saturated-fat"&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFfdLp"&gt;The trials began in January and will last until March 15th in Sweden and April 12th in Denmark. The McPlant’s Scandinavian success will be evaluated before potentially rolling out to other markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PI9LO"&gt;The patty is cooked on the same grill as beef burgers, so it’s not technically vegan (or vegetarian, depending on your dietary strictness). Nonetheless, a &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/se/sv-se/newsroom/article/News.Recent.mcplant.html"&gt;press release from McDonald’s Sweden&lt;/a&gt; pitches the McPlant as the latest option for “flexitarians” — people who are loosely vegetarian but still eat some meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOHuXE"&gt;McDonald’s and Beyond collaborated previously with the &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/9/26/20885096/mcdonalds-beyond-meat-plant-sandwich"&gt;“P.L.T.” in Canada&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear if the McPlant partnership will continue past these early trials. “While McDonald’s will source the McPlant patties for the tests through Beyond Meat, it didn’t specify the suppliers for future roll-outs,” says &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aeoPk"&gt;The McPlant is the latest in a trend of fast food companies &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger"&gt;going in on simulated meats&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, Burger King, Dunkin’, Starbucks, KFC, and others have all dabbled with products from either Beyond Meat or its competitor, Impossible Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
