    <title>CES showed off the COVID-19 mask gimmick arms race</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEzjZi"&gt;Millions of people in the US started buying face masks in 2020, and companies, unsurprisingly, rushed to take advantage of the surge of demand for a new product. At CES 2021, the gadget-ification of the mask was on full display. Leading the pack was Razer’s transparent voice-amplifying, light-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;concept mask&lt;/a&gt;. AirPop promoted its &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/airpop-active-plus-smart-mask-news/"&gt;Active+ Smart Mask&lt;/a&gt;, which monitors users’ breathing rates and alerts them via a smartphone app when the mask’s filter needs changing. Binatone’s &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/maskfone-integrates-earbuds-and-mic-into-n95-mask-no-more-muffled-phone-calls"&gt;MaskFone&lt;/a&gt; has built-in earbuds and a mic for phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3ajHx"&gt;Turning masks into a status symbol is nothing new, nor is capitalizing on a disaster to make a buck. Before the pandemic, people wore masks to protect from air pollution, and they’re fashion items in China and India. Also before the pandemic, companies making masks advertised for that purpose were starting to enter the US market. Last year at CES, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21050763/atmos-faceware-climate-change-technology-disaster-capitalism-price"&gt;Ao Air&lt;/a&gt; announced a $350 air pollution-filtering gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="w91RX9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvHcxQ"&gt;Techy masks to protect against COVID-19 aren’t necessarily bad things. Health officials are doubling down on the messaging to cover your nose and mouth as cases surge through the country, and a sweeping review of the scientific evidence published this month confirmed, yet again, that &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118"&gt;masks work&lt;/a&gt;. Razer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it plans to work with medical experts if it ever decides to produce and sell its mask. Its concept mask has the dangerous and &lt;a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/cdc-says-avoid-valved-masks/"&gt;warned-against&lt;/a&gt; exhalation valve, but Razer says the mask would have a filter to block any virus exhaled by the wearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0ceD3"&gt;But a gimmick arms race won’t necessarily make masks work better. We need better masks for everyone, not just stylish products for people who can afford them. In the United States, nearly a year into the pandemic, most people are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/"&gt;still wearing cloth masks&lt;/a&gt;, which are better than nothing, but not the best way to block the virus. Cloth masks were supposed to be a stop-gap until officials could scale up production of medical-grade masks, but those never materialized. Meanwhile, Taiwan is distributing high-quality masks to citizens, and Germany is requiring N95-equivalent masks in stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scf3xx"&gt;Without federal action on masks, people are left on their own to find and purchase them. There aren’t good criteria for cloth masks, making it hard to figure out which offer the best protection. There are counterfeit medical-grade masks &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/850d9e6834fc71967af6d3dda65ad874"&gt;all over&lt;/a&gt; the country. It’s a crowded, confusing area, and gadgets jostle for space alongside &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34934223/slap-masks-safety/"&gt;slap bracelet&lt;/a&gt; masks and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fmarket%2Frhinestone_masks&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F16%2F22233507%2Fces-masks-covid-pandemic-capitol-antivirus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rhinestones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2mVbB"&gt;“We routinely get PR pitches for excellent new solutions as well as snake-oil remedies, and we sometimes have trouble telling them apart—how is an ordinary person supposed to evaluate competing claims?” Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wrp9fE"&gt;To combat the pandemic, the US needs effective masks to be distributed as a public health service. Instead, masks of all sorts are seen and marketed as commercial products. Companies selling light-up masks aren’t creating this problem, and if the flash helps someone to put one on, it’s a victory. But these flashy contributions just highlight how far we still have to go before we have simple and effective protection for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL5wsO"&gt;Here’s what else is going on this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JiYo3P"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="beRMj1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/health/coronavirus-immunity-future.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future of the Coronavirus? An Annoying Childhood Infection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the pandemic ends, COVID-19 could gradually become more like a childhood cold than a deadly disease, new research suggests. With vaccines, that transformation could happen quickly. (Apoorva Mandavilli, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3B2Kx2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22224445/covid-19-deaths-in-us-hospital-beds-icu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No ICU beds? Expect double the number of Covid-19 deaths.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The death risk from COVID-19 isn’t static. It changes depending on the quality of care doctors are able to provide. When intensive care units are full, people are more likely to die from the disease. (Julia Belluz, &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fO0ysD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/14/more-infectious-variants-could-make-things-much-worse/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covid-19 deaths are the highest they’ve ever been — and the more infectious variants could make things much worse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new coronavirus strain gaining a foothold in the United States isn’t more deadly, but it’s more contagious. It’s a scary scenario anyway: faster-spreading infections still mean more deaths. (Andrew Joseph, &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CYcQVj"&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5uQ9vr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22219362/end-of-covid-19-pandemic-social-distancing-masking"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you and your friends are vaccinated, can you quit social distancing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting vaccinated isn’t a free pass to act like the pandemic is over, but as people around you start to get vaccinated, life will start to return to normal. The transition will happen in stages until the pandemic settles worldwide. (Sigal Samuel, &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfYGwP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/covid-vaccine-johnson-johnson-one-shot-safe-generates-immune-response.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&amp;amp;J’s one-shot Covid vaccine is safe and generates promising immune response in early trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine is next in the pipeline, and early data shows that it can generate an immune response in just one dose. The company should release data on its efficacy later this month. (Berkeley Lovelace Jr., &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHk1WQ"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3oCyYY"&gt;I am angry that after I spent months carefully isolating myself, a single chaotic day likely got me sick. I am angry that several of our nation’s leaders were unwilling to deal with the small annoyance of a mask for a few hours. I am angry that the attack on the Capitol and my subsequent illness have the same cause: my Republican colleagues’ inability to accept facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk1FAQ"&gt;— Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/12/bonnie-watson-coleman-covid-republicans-masks/"&gt;writes in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after testing positive for COVID-19 following the Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="46XuC0"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1DFTkk"&gt;To the more than 93,604,952 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBcryY"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,003,885 people who have died worldwide — 390,809 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkEDsS"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAleAr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 full development reportedly didn’t start until 2016</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s7P9Zg057JWux6iRTZJRM8B8BRA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68677887/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;A new report looking into what went amiss with the rollout of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; points to overconfidence from management at CD Projekt Red as a key problem, and reveals that “full development” of the game — announced in 2012— didn’t begin until 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="986r9F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-16/cyberpunk-2077-what-caused-the-video-game-s-disastrous-rollout"&gt;Jason Schreier of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; interviewed&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, and found that the game’s development was plagued by unrealistic deadlines and technical issues. The company “hit the reset button” on the game in 2016, but a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446960/e3-2018-cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-microsoft-trailer"&gt;demo of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; showed at E3 in 2018&lt;/a&gt; was “almost entirely fake,” according to the report. The development also suffered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with programmers on the PC version and testers of the console version working separately from each other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhqthJ"&gt;In the months leading up to its December 10th launch, reports emerged of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538525/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-death-threats-game-delay"&gt;Projekt Red staff working long&lt;/a&gt;, arduous hours to meet the launch deadlines. Almost immediately after the the release of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, console players encountered widespread bugs, frame rate issues, and other problems. Within a week of launch, Sony had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from the PlayStation Store and offered refunds. One investor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;suing CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt; over the botched launch, and earlier this week, the PC version of the game was available for purchase for almost half off its original price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfeB38"&gt;Projekt Red co-founder Marcin Iwinski issued a mea culpa for the messy release, saying that despite the generally positive reception for the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; the console version of the game “did not meet the quality standard we wanted it to meet.” The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229627/cyberpunk-2077-first-update-launch-cd-projekt-red-playstation-store"&gt;planning to release the game’s first big update&lt;/a&gt; within the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;According to&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, CD Projekt Red was still focused on &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; was announced in 2012. Company executives apparently believed they could replicate the success it had with that game in developing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk.&lt;/em&gt; And in a detail that didn’t make the final edit of the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1350329528019791872?s=20"&gt;Schreier tweeted that the game&lt;/a&gt; had changed significantly since it was first announced; up until 2016, he says, it was a third-person game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmvlqm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bATJkp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pN68n3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The deals are slow, but we got some exclusives for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2I18s6mxHdUMHXNwiNxIj9Jh9s=/73x0:858x523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68677778/slim_folio_pro_for_ipad_pro__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DjwKED"&gt;Welcome to the weekend. If I’m being honest, this week’s assortment of deals was just as spotty as last week’s. So, to make it a little better, we’ve worked with some retailers to give &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers some exclusive deals. Looking forward, if you’re on the hunt for, say, a big 4K TV or a home theater system, we’ll be sure to include the top deals in our regular &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; coverage as the Super Bowl nears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ttmiti"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xKYG26"&gt;Save big on Logitech’s keyboard case for iPad Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OawNd7"&gt;Daily Steals is giving &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a special discount on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656227/apple-ipad-pro-11-12-9-keyboard-test-review-logitech-brydge-zagg-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech Slim Folio Pro keyboard case for the 11-inch or 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above). These cases connect to your iPad Pro via Bluetooth and recharge via USB-C. Both sizes have backlit keys, making it easier to see the keys in the dark. These are new with Logitech’s one-year warranty, but Daily Steals says each will arrive in non-retail packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48csqe"&gt;You can get the 11-inch case made for both the 2018 and 2020 releases (the large rear camera cutout ensures compatibility for either tablet) for just $70, which is well below the $120 price Logitech is asking on its site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="jbzxsZ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://fave.co/3bGqp2e" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it here for $70&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELOGIT &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ILCvMp"&gt;If you have the 2018 version of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (it has just a single rear-facing camera lens), that case will be just $50, which is $30 lower than the current price at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pd5SfU"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1616420&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Flogitech-slim-folio-pro-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-3rd-gen-case-with-bluetooth-keyboard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it here for $50&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELOGIT &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="uLP0pm"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PGb0u3"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds are $30 off for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HdnebM"&gt;If you’ve been tossing around getting a pair of Google’s latest Pixel Buds, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Google/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headphones+Earphones/1389562"&gt;“clearly white” colorway for $149 at Antonline&lt;/a&gt;. These usually cost $179 new, and currently no other retailers are offering a price cut. To get this deal, input the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE30 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to knock $30 off the final cost. This promo will last until January 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HssHs"&gt;FYI: If you thought “&lt;em&gt;what in the heck is Antonline?&lt;/em&gt;” I first noticed them as a reputable seller on eBay, but they have also been ramping up sales directly from their own site. Aside from the one-off deal like this one, it also hosts the occasional PS5 and Xbox Series X drop (you know, in case you’re still looking for one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ujvNgQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OxlBaT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Oy4BiC"&gt;Samsung’s preorder perks for the Galaxy S21 are great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I09xte"&gt;ICYMI, preorders for the Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra went live yesterday. The phones will release on January 29th, but if you place an order ahead of then, you’ll reap some great preorder rewards no matter where you buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2jyJY"&gt;My colleague Taylor Lyles has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225628/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-preorder-how-to-price-verizon-tmobile-sprint"&gt;all of the details right here&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll really want to check it out if you’re planning on upgrading through a carrier. The short version is that you’ll get up to $200 in Samsung credit to use on accessories, along with a complimentary Samsung Galaxy SmartTag to help you keep track of your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwJPUs"&gt;Driving around a car that looks like it’s made from the fabric of space is now slightly more possible, as demonstrated in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53JclJwR4Po"&gt;this modified black paint job&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;DipYourCar&lt;/em&gt; applied to a Mitsubishi Lancer.  The resulting car, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-worlds-blackest-paint-and-sparkles-make-a-car-look-1846066602?utm_campaign=Gizmodo&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, absorbs 99.4 percent of light, but features speckled luminescent spots that make it look like the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNEwQ1"&gt;The project required the use of &lt;a href="https://www.ko-pro.black/product/musou-black-paint/"&gt;Musou Black&lt;/a&gt; paint made by Koyo Orient Japan and the application of &lt;a href="https://www.dipyourcar.com/products/ztp-hypershift-pearls?variant=18006214148"&gt;HyperShift&lt;/a&gt;, pearlescent particles used to create shiny finishes on cars. After some tinkering with paint thinner, the final result is stunning, even if it is as fragile and impractical as &lt;em&gt;DipYourCar &lt;/em&gt;suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="czUbzg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53JclJwR4Po?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="El6946"&gt;The effect is reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20813054/vantablack-ultrablack-black-material-surrey-nanosystems-carbon-nanotubes-science-materials"&gt;Vantablack&lt;/a&gt;, a light absorbing material made from carbon nanotubes. Wild applications of Vantablack are well documented, from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/museum-visitor-falls-into-giant-hole-that-looks-like-a-1828462859"&gt;cartoon holes in museums&lt;/a&gt; to other cars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836806/bmw-x6-vantablack-black-paint-frankfurt-motor-show"&gt;like this BMW&lt;/a&gt;. But this project actually highlights one of the weirder aspects of the material. The rights to create art with Vantablack were granted exclusively to one artist, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anish_Kapoor"&gt;Anish Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;. Vantablack “requires specialist application to achieve its aesthetic effect” according to &lt;a href="https://www.surreynanosystems.com/about/faqs"&gt;the material’s creator Surrey NanoSystems&lt;/a&gt;, and Kapoor is apparently one of the few people qualified to apply it. Kapoor’s license and Vantablack’s other use in the military and aerospace industries have kept it out of reach of the average artist or car enthusiast, giving its visual effect an even more alluring quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jbzo6n"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Carbon nanotubes built this bizarre ultrablack material|67002" data-volume-uuid="ba4e0d671" data-volume-id="67002" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-985" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out this video for more on Vantablack’s origins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GzM0yQ"&gt;The exclusivity of Vantablack has prompted &lt;a href="https://www.format.com/magazine/features/art/anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-vantablack-blackest-black"&gt;competition from other artists&lt;/a&gt;, and the creation of products like Musou Black, that get close to replicating the effects of true Vantablack. As you can see with &lt;em&gt;DipYourCar&lt;/em&gt;’s project, it’s more than enough. My advice is to cue up some &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXkegHyURbI&amp;amp;list=OLAK5uy_lOq4NjXU5q4EN0BTR67iTW7e_g_3qa5jc"&gt;appropriate space music&lt;/a&gt;, throw up a gif of that car, and drift off into the void of the weekend. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FAA just greenlit this drone to fly autonomously without a human nearby</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M_P2zV5GXkbCaKih-dApmwwlImA=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676737/american_robotics_drone.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOAbKO"&gt;In October, the FAA took a major stride towards letting increasingly smart drones fly themselves, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;letting Skydio’s self-flying drones inspect any bridge in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; for four years, as long as humans first verified those bridges were clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yUP9v"&gt;Now, the US airspace regulator is taking an even bigger step: American Robotics &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005587/en/American-Robotics-Becomes-First-Company-Approved-by-the-FAA-To-Operate-Automated-Drones-Without-Human-Operators-On-Site"&gt;says it’s become the first company&lt;/a&gt; allowed to operate drones without needing a human pilot or an observer anywhere near the aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oebkTp"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as big a deal as you’d expect from the company’s press release or &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s headline &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-approves-first-fully-automated-commercial-drone-flights-11610749377?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;“FAA Approves First Fully Automated Commercial Drone Flights,”&lt;/a&gt; because humans still need to be part of the equation: &lt;a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2019-0775-0008"&gt;FAA documents show&lt;/a&gt; that American Robotics will still need to assign a human to each and every flight, who’ll run through a safety checklist before takeoff and inspect the aircraft with remote tools. They’re not fully automated yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zEb3t7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.338%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/438185792?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NG7v0z"&gt;But after that, the company’s drone-in-a-box Scout will take over and fly the mission — and automatically halt if needed. The Scout’s box includes &lt;a href="https://sara.com/tasa"&gt;an acoustic detection system&lt;/a&gt; that lets the drone sense and avoid other aircraft; the base station can spot an incoming aircraft over two miles away and automatically force the drone to descend, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpwJxxsgPL-MQadptfHTZLzhNpE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22239563/ScoutBase___Doors_Closed__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by American Robotics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ScoutBase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2OEIxa"&gt;The FAA’s also only approving this waiver for a handful of specific locations in Kansas, Massachusetts and Nevada that are owned by the company or its customers, so it’s not like they’ll be flying over people unawares, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL9eRO"&gt;As you can see in the company’s video for the Scout system, it’s targeting this tech at companies that want push-button aerial inspections of their own property — not exactly drone deliveries. For that, the FAA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408646/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-clearance-approval-health-safety-alphabet-wing"&gt;a separate kind of certification&lt;/a&gt;. But the FAA does seem interested in what it can learn from letting American Robotics fly without humans physically nearby, as it explains in its justification for the waiver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hOJX1A"&gt;American Robotics’ proposed operations will provide the FAA with critical data for use in evaluating BVLOS operations from offsite locations. Once adopted on a wider scale, such a scheme could lend efficiencies to many of the industries that fuel our economy such as agriculture, transportation, mining, technology, and non-durable manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JrFzQ2"&gt;American Robotics previously had a beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) waiver from the FAA, but &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/part_107_waivers/waivers_issued/media/107W-2020-01574_Vijay_Somandepalli_CoW.pdf"&gt;that one (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; required its pilots to physically be at a location for the pre-flight inspections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medium acquires ebook company Glose</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="medium" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2i3pACGytjT5vuZdNrD2a1kyys=/0x0:896x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676696/Medium.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ns6gDB"&gt;Medium &lt;a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-acquires-social-ebook-platform-glose-cf2e94485d8"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; its acquisition of the social-based ebook company Glose. Glose is a platform where users can buy and read books, then share notes and highlights with friends. In the press release announcing the acquisition, Medium CEO Ev Williams says that the company “look[s] forward to working with the Glose team on partnering with publishers to help authors reach more readers.” However, as &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/medium-acquires-glose-201755956.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;notes, once the integration is complete, Glose’s library “won’t be included in Medium’s $5 monthly and $50 annual subscriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWH6TU"&gt;What the integration between Glose and Medium will &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; look like is still a little unclear. In &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/media/medium-acquires-glose/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Glose CEO Nicolas Princen raises the idea of readers being able to jump from an article into a book. “The vision is to create an experience where you can go from one to the next,” he says. “You can read an article and then just one-click purchase a book that connects to that content if you want to go deeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1ZnmI"&gt;There are a few ways a Glose/Medium integration could go about this. I’d like to imagine that Medium could show me books written by the author of the article I’m reading. Going even further, Medium could also find books about the article’s subject and show those to readers who want to go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULbeOA"&gt;As an avid reader myself, both those ideas are intriguing, and I’d love to see how it works in practice. Ev Williams also talked to &lt;em&gt;CNN Business &lt;/em&gt;about making it easier to spin off a blog post from an inspiring book passage from Glose: “If I’m reading a book and some particular passage speaks to me, I can very seamlessly take that to my blog, maybe write about it, maybe have a discussion about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vk9Noi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If I’m reading a book and [a] passage speaks to me, I can very seamlessly take that to my blog.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ehpa4"&gt;While how much the acquisition cost Medium isn’t public, it does provide a revenue stream for the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15028310/medium-membership-subscriptions-launch"&gt;outside of its subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. While it may be a struggle to convince people to pay to read shorter-form articles, many people are already accustomed to paying for books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R40Ddh"&gt;However Medium decides to integrate with Glose, one thing is clear — the company wants to be a formidable force in online reading, and it has just added 1.5 million books to its library.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is blocking events near the White House through Inauguration Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Washington, DC Prepares For Potential Unrest Ahead Of Presidential Inauguration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DW1Gi8pr0W1cTuNnU1KKe0745sQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676476/1230589408.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sXevSu"&gt;Facebook won’t let people create events that take place “in close proximity” to the White House, the US Capitol building, or any state capitol buildings through Inauguration Day, the company announced &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. The move builds upon Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/"&gt;previously announced Inauguration Day preparations&lt;/a&gt; aiming to prevent the platform from being used to organize a violent event like the January 6th attack on the US Capitol.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nc7WPA"&gt;Facebook is also doing a “secondary review” of all inauguration-related events and will remove those that violate the platform’s rules. The company is also continuing a policy that blocks pages and accounts based outside the US from creating events located in the US. That policy was first put in place for the US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJXdSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has come under scrutiny for allowing posts promoting the January 6th riots to spread&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fygS3"&gt;The company has come under scrutiny for allowing posts promoting and organizing the January 6th riots &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/"&gt;to spread across Facebook and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and for ads promoting military equipment that ran alongside content that contained election misinformation and calls for violence, according to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-profits-military-gear-ads-capitol-riot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said&lt;/a&gt; she believes the riots were “were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate,” the company is still stepping up enforcement of its policies and working to remove potentially dangerous content ahead of Inauguration Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bURPm8"&gt;Accounts that have repeatedly violated Facebook’s policies could be restricted. Those restrictions may include being blocked from creating live videos, events, groups, or pages, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2b1R9H"&gt;Facebook isn’t the only platform trying to prevent Inauguration Day gatherings. Airbnb is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;blocking and canceling&lt;/a&gt; all DC metro area reservations during inauguration week and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227028/airbnb-block-capitol-attackers-returning-dc-gofundme"&gt;banning people&lt;/a&gt; who were involved in the January 6th riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV7Hw9"&gt;In the days since that attack, many platforms have taken actions to try and prevent people from organizing another one. Facebook, for example, is now blocking the phrase “stop the steal.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have banned conservative-friendly social app Parler from their app stores, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon has terminated&lt;/a&gt; Parler’s hosting, effectively kicking it off the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is blocking Apple Silicon Mac users from sideloading iPhone apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot with an error message saying “Unable to install ‘PS App’ Please try again later”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-lRiTcoTbR5HI1lAsiVDeaN5Bs=/0x0:803x535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676278/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.19.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message in macOS 11.1.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Jay Peters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCRz7v"&gt;Apple has turned off users’ ability to unofficially install iOS apps onto their M1 Macs (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-blocks-m1-mac-iphone-app-side-loading/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While iOS apps are still available in the Mac App Store, many apps, such as Dark Sky and Netflix, don’t have their developer’s approval to be run on macOS. Up until now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574207/how-to-install-run-any-iphone-ipad-app-m1-mac"&gt;there was a workaround&lt;/a&gt; that allowed the use of third-party software to install the apps without having to use the Mac App Store, but it seems like Apple has remotely disabled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bqtcld"&gt;When we tried to install an unsupported app on an M1 Mac running macOS 11.1, we got an error message saying that we couldn’t install it and should “try again later”. You can see a screenshot at the top of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xrOykf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mac users have been used to having more freedom in what programs they’re able to run&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnodcf"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;, the message on the most recent macOS 11.2 beta is more specific: “the application cannot be installed because the developer did not intend for it to run on this platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPy6vy"&gt;Apple moving to block the unauthorized app installs isn’t necessarily surprising. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/13/macos-beta-code-suggests-apple-will-block-users-from-sideloading-unsupported-ios-apps-on-m1-macs/"&gt;Code was found in the beta&lt;/a&gt; indicating a ban would be coming, and Apple has given developers power to block their apps from running on the Mac — a power that is undermined by sideloading. It is, however, sad to see the feature go, as Mac users have been used to having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167964/cydia-sues-apple-monopoly-anticompetitive-iphone"&gt;more freedom in what programs they’re able to run&lt;/a&gt; than they do on iOS (though Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intego.com%2Fmac-security-blog%2Fwhat-are-all-those-macos-catalina-security-alerts%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F15%2F22233754%2Fapple-blocking-m1-iphone-app-sideloading#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;control on the Mac has been tightening over the years&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhcXOw"&gt;We were able to run an app that we had already installed, but Apple is clearly cracking down on this behavior, so there's no guarantees that our already-sideloaded apps will work in the future either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly prototyping foldable iPhone screens</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4esEx0"&gt;Apple has started work on a foldable phone, and it’s begun prototyping foldable screens internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A final device is likely still years away, the report says, and Apple is working on just the display for now — not the rest of the phone it would attach to&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrPm9a"&gt;The initial prototypes sound similar to the foldable screens we’ve seen used by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and others. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple is looking at making foldable screens with a “mostly invisible hinge” that could unfold to around the size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The report says that several screen sizes are being discussed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9z7JXa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under-display Touch ID is reportedly still in testing for 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSC7fl"&gt;Apple hasn’t publicly indicated any interest in making a foldable phone, though the company rarely signals its interest before entering a new product category. Major competitors have a head start on foldable devices, with Samsung and Motorola already releasing multiple generations of folding phones. Samsung’s Galaxy Fold came out in April 2019 (albeit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;with some substantial issues&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q61LiJ"&gt;On a more immediate note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;has some updates on Apple products coming in 2021. This year’s iPhone is expected to have “minor upgrades,” but one more substantial improvement is still a possibility: an in-screen fingerprint sensor. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;already said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/apple-working-on-in-display-fingerprint-id-for-future-iphones"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was looking into the feature for as early as 2020, and it’d be an obvious addition in 2021 since the wide adoption of face masks has seriously hindered the ability to use Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPtBM"&gt;It’s not clear how likely in-display Touch ID is to ship in 2021 (Apple tends to have iPhone features locked well in advance of production), but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says Apple is “still testing” the tech for inclusion this year. On a worse note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also says that Apple has discussed removing the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging on “some” iPhone models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVN73K"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored Tile competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, are finally planned to launch this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports, and the iPad Pro could be refreshed with a Mini LED display. A thinner entry-level iPad is reportedly in the works as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
