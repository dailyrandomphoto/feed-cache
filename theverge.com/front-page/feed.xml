    <title>Polaris and Optimus Ride are co-developing ‘fully autonomous’ low-speed shuttles</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lutxqn"&gt;Autonomous shuttle startup Optimus Ride and power sports vehicle manufacturer Polaris are teaming up to co-develop a new lineup of vehicles that will be low-speed, electric, and self-driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOtDym"&gt;These low-speed vehicles (LSV) will be equipped with Optimus Ride’s full stack of sensors and software to enable “fully autonomous” driving without a safety driver behind the wheel — though the vehicles will also be monitored remotely by a team of engineers who can offer suggestions to the vehicle when things go wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZggu4"&gt;The vehicles, which can seat six, will be deployed as a last-mile transportation service in residential communities, corporate and academic campuses, and other “localized environments,” as both a fixed-route shuttle and a more dynamic, point-to-point ride-hailing service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mcZBGG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The vehicles will roll out in the first half of 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0AihQS"&gt;The LSVs will be manufactured under the brand name GEM, which stands for Global Electric Motorcars. Minnesota-based Polaris owns GEM, having acquired it in 2011, and it’s also an investor in Optimus Ride. The startup, which originally spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, currently uses GEM shuttles to test its autonomous technology in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanLinden/status/1376577813038370817"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, Boston, California, Washington, DC, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18214536/optimus-ride-self-driving-cars-robot-taxi-brookfield-virginia"&gt;Northern Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCauEK"&gt;The vehicles, which will be rolled out in the first half of 2023, will be built without traditional controls like steering wheels and pedals, said Optimus Ride CEO Sean Harrington — although there will still be a way to move the vehicles manually. “The intention is we would have all six seats available for passengers,” Harrington told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “which means where you have currently have a driver’s seat, would be another passenger seat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCYrvG"&gt;Harrington said the decision to co-develop vehicles with Polaris was about making a better autonomous vehicle and also scaling up production to the point where the startup can start to deploy potentially thousands of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBM3Ms"&gt;“There’s just a lot more flexibility you have by custom-designing that vehicle with safety and performance built in from the ground up, as opposed to doing it sort of piecemeal,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6i_6P4kJTWlNItOHr7WELOokQzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18842576/ahawkins_190804_3589_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KY1RWq"&gt;A dozen or so low-speed autonomous shuttle services have sprung up around the country in recent years. Experts see them as a good entry point for consumers into AV technology, while regulators and city officials like keeping the vehicles contained in small, less populated areas. Optimus Ride claims that it has completed “over 75,000 rides” over the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mmYvp"&gt;Optimus Ride isn’t the only company staking out a position in the low-speed autonomous shuttle space. Other companies, like May Mobility, Voyage (now owned by Cruise), and Local Motors, have launched small pilot projects in cities over the years — though they have yet to scale up to a fully operational commercial service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU3qDF"&gt;Other AV operators, like Waymo, Zoox, and Cruise, are also interested in launching fully autonomous ride-hail operations. Harrington says that Optimus Ride can still be competitive with those companies, despite operating vehicles with a top speed of only 25 mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oaxrMp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not some sort of virtual rails AV system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GeXdPc"&gt;“To be clear, this is not some sort of virtual rails AV system where you get in an environment and if there’s an obstacle, if there’s something in your way, that vehicle can’t proceed,” he said. “This is a vehicle that is out in a fairly complex environment.” These limitations, Harrington said, position Optimus Ride to provide an autonomous transportation service “today, as opposed to many, many years from now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ritYO"&gt;This kind of small-scale business can also be extremely difficult to get right. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;Drive.ai nearly went out of business before it got bought by Apple&lt;/a&gt;. And Navya, a major autonomous shuttle manufacturer based in France, is &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/29196/navya-pivots-away-from-experimental-autonomous-shuttle-business"&gt;pivoting away from the shuttle business&lt;/a&gt; in favor of licensing its software to third-party clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd4chb"&gt;Polaris makes a variety of off-road vehicles, including the popular RZR lineup as well as garish three-wheelers like the Slingshot. It also owns Indian Motorcycle, which it acquired in 2011. The company recently announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21473587/polaris-zero-motorcycles-electric-ev-off-road-vehicle-snowmobiles"&gt;partnership with Zero Motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; to co-develop electric vehicles, including ATVs and snowmobiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqUt5V"&gt;“I think this is the smart place for all of us to be betting on,” said Keith Simon, vice president and general manager of Polaris Commercial, “which is why we’re doing this and why we’re so excited about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PayPal will let US users pay with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin starting today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Checkout with Crypto" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cG5Fz3G-px2aRA9nLEoJvMnRwPQ=/116x7:3157x2034/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047265/Checkout_with_Crypto_image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlSiSw"&gt;We already knew that PayPal was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527288/paypal-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-venmo-bitcoin"&gt;planning to support cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; as a form of payment. And now, the online payment app announced US customers can do just that with its “Checkout with Crypto” feature, rolling out today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YDTb3"&gt;After rolling out the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562771/paypal-cryptocurrency-buy-sell-bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin-us-users"&gt;US users to directly buy and sell cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; directly from their accounts last November, PayPal’s new “Checkout with Crypto” allows users to instantly convert their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Bitcoin Cash to US dollars (with no additional transaction fees) that PayPal then uses to complete the transaction. If a merchant doesn’t take US dollars, PayPal also converts those dollars into local currency at standard conversion rates set by PayPal. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tacC6RkjsT5OnQJh4ccW0FdHWsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406834/paypal_crypto_screen.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal will support several types of cryptocurrency, including Ethereum and Bitcoin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4OQuh2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;PayPal is not the first payment app to offer support for cryptocurrency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="htM45Y"&gt;The feature will automatically appear in the PayPal wallet if a user has a “sufficient cryptocurrency balance to cover an eligible purchase,” and you’ll be able to see your crypto balances for each kind of coin in the app. However, you can only use one type of cryptocurrency for each purchase you make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aj1fUe"&gt;PayPal is not the first payment app to offer support for cryptocurrency. In 2018, its competitor, Square, launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17689156/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-support-to-all-50-us-states"&gt;support for Bitcoin on the Cash App&lt;/a&gt;. But the launch of cryptocurrency as a form of payment makes PayPal both a major digital wallet and a cryptocurrency exchange, which could streamline the use of cryptocurrency as a more common payment method. During its Investor Day last week, the company reported that it had &lt;a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_presentations/2021/02/PP-Investor-Day-2021-Combined-FINAL.pdf"&gt;377 million active accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making some big upgrades to directions in Google Maps </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VBvgxC5YgMZz9do457SeA5d3yyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047241/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YFqdYc"&gt;Google is announcing a bunch of new features planned for Google Maps, including a new tool to help with indoor navigation and suggestions for eco-friendly driving routes. The features announced today aren’t rolling out all at once, though; many aren’t available just yet, and it’s unclear when some will be available in some parts of the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPB9oh"&gt;One of the biggest announcements is that Google is bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776247/google-maps-live-view-ar-walking-directions-ios-android-feature"&gt;Live View augmented reality&lt;/a&gt; directions to airports, transit stations, and malls. Live View directions let you hold your phone up, point your camera at the world around you, and see arrows and icons pointing you where you need to go, and previously, they only worked outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uLR0p"&gt;Disappointingly, though, these indoor AR directions aren’t being rolled out very widely yet: they’re only available in some malls in Chicago, Long Island, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle right now. Google will launch indoor Live View directions in select transit stations, airports, and malls in Tokyo and Zurich in the coming months, however, and more cities are “on the way,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5Xe48wt7uFBEOTfW93zUqQKZuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406882/Indoor_Live_View_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pzxjze"&gt;Google is also planning to revamp the interface for picking your mode of transportation for directions on Android and iOS. Right now, you have to toggle through different tabs to see more detail about different transportation options, but with this new interface, you’ll just scroll through a list. The company says Maps will even be able to prioritize the modes you prefer and put those that are popular in certain cities (the subway in New York City, for example) higher up the list. This new interface is set to roll out globally in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V-u7roBXlCfB-vBnxAiMa5EIHCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407035/New_directions_experience.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uOoQPl"&gt;In addition to the directions interface, Google is adding a new type of driving route that’s optimized for lower fuel consumption. If the eco-friendly route has about the same ETA as the fastest route to a location, Google Maps will default to the fuel-efficient route, though you can change this in settings if you’d like. Google plans to make these new fuel-efficient routes available on Android and iOS in the US later this year and globally at an unspecified time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1QOPIU5AYJnEusn3p_fEFx66JMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407083/Eco_Friendly_Routes.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CRS9Dq"&gt;The fuel-efficient routes aren’t the only eco-friendly updates for Maps: Google also plans to introduce alerts that will tell you when you’ll be navigating through low-emissions zones, which don’t allow some vehicles with certain levels of emissions to enter. Google says these alerts will launch in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK on Android and iOS this June. More countries will get the alerts soon, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SsU_C9fQM8NHnsqu1suy-zM8F_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407087/Low_Emission_Zone.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google Maps&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C9PM9T"&gt;Google is also making new map layers for weather and air quality that are set to roll out in the coming months on Android and iOS. Google plans to launch the weather layer globally and launch the air quality layer first in Australia, India, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jGpfxbZrNmJ1QbE-iq9FEO8WQ4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406900/Weather__Air_Quality_Layers.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fUOixM"&gt;Google also plans to pilot a new grocery pickup tool this summer with select Portland, Oregon-based locations of Kroger-owned grocery store Fred Meyer. The tool lets you share your location and ETA with the store via Google Maps so that your grocery order can be ready when you arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LF-Z concept shows just how far Lexus has to go in EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4KkETVvJL-u8lOlQ-Ibs3su338=/596x453:2185x1512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047267/2021_Lexus_LFZ_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Lexus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Lexus’ next generation looks a lot like what we have now&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gXSK4g"&gt;Toyota is finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22187113/toyota-electric-vehicles-us-suv-debut-hybrids"&gt;following the rest of its peers into making all-electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and that now includes its luxury brand, Lexus. On Tuesday, the Japanese marque revealed the LF-Z Electrified concept car, which is all about charting the company’s course into an electric future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq6Kce"&gt;Mind you, that future in Lexus’ eyes still involves a healthy mix of hybrid and even hydrogen-powered vehicles, &lt;em&gt;as well as gas-only cars&lt;/em&gt;. The company said Tuesday it will introduce 20 new vehicles by 2025 and that just 10 of those will be all-electric, hybrid, or run on hydrogen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqFVzv"&gt;Lexus did say it wants to reach carbon neutrality “throughout the lifecycle of its entire model lineup” but that its goal is to do this by 2050. Lexus also acknowledged Tuesday that the industry is entering a period of “once-in-a-century” transformation, which is... something, considering that Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda recently bucked the trend and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyotas-chief-says-electric-vehicles-are-overhyped-11608196665"&gt;said electric vehicles are “overhyped.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ylqTx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The head of Toyota — Lexus’ parent company — has said EVs are “overhyped”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eem908"&gt;But back to the concept car. It’s angular and futuristic, like many concepts tend to be. It’s shorter than most modern Lexus vehicles, and even features a sort of inversion of the company’s iconic (for better or worse) massive grille; instead of a gridded black diamond pattern, the flat silver bodywork traces a triangular shape down the nose. Tracking with the design that many modern EVs have adopted, the rear of the LF-Z features a continuous light bar that’s broken up only by the company’s reimagined wordmark. And there’s a panoramic glass roof stretching across the top of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G3ZJSH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10419467"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BFTGka"&gt;The interior is more radical, even if it is familiar to anyone who’s looked at a lot of concept cars. The bucket seats have a distinct geometric look to them, and are surrounded by various lighting elements. It’s otherwise quite sparse, save for the cluster of screens that hug the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcxUQS"&gt;Being a concept car, the LZ-F is less about specs and more about &lt;em&gt;ideas &lt;/em&gt;and what Lexus imagines it might do with its future vehicles. One idea Lexus is chewing on with this concept is something called “Direct4,” which is basically just a branded version of torque vectoring that would drive power to each wheel independently, improving grip in high-performance situations. At a more base level, Lexus says this concept car is designed to achieve “ideal balance and inertia” while driving thanks to optimal placement of the battery and motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zhu2B"&gt;(This all sounds sort of like Nissan’s &lt;a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/nissans-e-4orce-giving-drivers-of-all-levels-comfort-and-control"&gt;new torque vectoring system&lt;/a&gt; that is coming to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324125/nissan-ariya-electric-suv-crossover-specs-price"&gt;Ariya EV&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s hard to say for sure without more details.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRlIGMSKIQ5LXaVkkCLzABo9bPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407350/2021_Lexus_LFZ_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QWc4pd"&gt;Also, Lexus says the driver’s position and the screens were designed based on “the new concept of ‘Tazuna’” — which is Japanese for “rein.” The company describes this part of the concept car as such: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GoiYeU"&gt;Inspired by the relationship between horse and rider, who communicate through a single rein, steering wheel-mounted switches and the vehicle’s head-up display have been highly coordinated to create a space in which various functions, such as the navigation system, audio system, and driving mode selection, can be performed while concentrating on driving and without movement of the driver’s line of sight or need to operate complicated switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kkZFls"&gt;This wouldn’t be a true concept car without some kind of artificial intelligence, and so of course Lexus has accounted for that here. But the company says AI would be used in the LZ-F in frankly pedestrian ways, like predicting what route a driver might take, or making restaurant reservations. Lexus believes this is a big step forward, though. “Such interactivity between AI and driver leads to a fruitful dialogue, thus improving the overall ownership and driving experience, adding color to the customer’s life as a lifestyle concierge,” the company writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw7hvX"&gt;There are a few other more grounded technological features, like a digital key that allows multiple people to access the car, or door handles that present themselves — both the kinds of things that are already increasingly common on modern electric vehicles. It, of course, has autonomous driving modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oj0nba"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The LZ-F is full of big ideas, but are they really that futuristic?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GanfHk"&gt;In fact, the more you look at the LZ-F, the more you may realize that it’s as much of a sign of what Lexus (and Toyota) have missed out on as it waited to chart this bold vision of the future of the brand — even if it is a far more realistic take than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927635/lexus-lf-30-electrified-concept-car-tokyo-motor-show-2019"&gt;drone-deploying LF-30 EV concept Lexus showed off in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRqZYn"&gt;The company has played a very conservative hand here at the beginning of what is, by its own admission, a massive transformation in the industry. And while there are certain advantages to that strategy — like &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/volkswagen-is-betting-82-5-billion-on-electric-cars-1820539398"&gt;not spending dozens of billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; — the LZ-F is a good reminder of some of the disadvantages, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rnjqi9"&gt;Lexus surely thinks it can do some of these things better than the rest of the competition no matter when it brings some of the LZ-F’s ideas to market. But if the future really is electric, Lexus will still find itself playing catch-up for the foreseeable future. The LZ-F is proof.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kia’s EV6 is a small electric car with big dreams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-odg78vkHuO_oTAKpV0Fc_BmnM=/0x0:2327x1551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047066/Kia_EV6_GT_line_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Kia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The first of a new wave of Kia (and Hyundai) electrics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="D92Fzk"&gt;After spending the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331130/kia-ev6-full-images-revealed-design-announcement-date"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; teasing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323438/kia-ev6-electric-car-hyundai-apple-platform"&gt;new electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, Kia just laid out a lot of what there is to know about the EV6 — at least for the most expensive models. But it all lines up with what the teaser images, well, teased, which is that the EV6 will be a fun and fast electric car with a refreshingly modest footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5mKQn"&gt;Due out in “select global markets” in the second half of this year, including North America, the EV6 is the first Kia car that is built to be electric from the ground up. The modestly successful Niro EV SUV? That was, at a high level, a gas car that was retrofit to run on batteries. The EV6, however, is built on what Kia will use to power six future EVs. That same platform, called E-GMP, is being used by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;parent company Hyundai to power the Ioniq 5 EV&lt;/a&gt; and other future electric vehicles, too. (It’s also allegedly what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;Apple was interested in before talks broke down&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fTDAxz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Around 300 miles at the high end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWVfZy"&gt;Which is all to say that the EV6 is quite an important car for Kia. As such, the company made sure it’s full of attractive features and leading technologies. But it still isn’t going to blow buyers away with its range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OSn0Pw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10419406"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aevr7C"&gt;The EV6 will be available in rear-wheel and in all-wheel drive configurations, and Kia will outfit it with standard range (58kWh) or long range (77.4kWh) battery packs. Kia says the rear-wheel drive EV6 with the long-range pack can go 510 kilometers, or roughly 316 miles, based on the European WLTP testing standard. That means an EPA range is likely going to be a little bit less, perhaps under 300 miles. Kia did not provide range estimates for the other configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25amHk"&gt;Depending on the real world results, that’s fairly good efficiency out of a battery pack of that size. But Kia’s promoting just that one range figure, meaning that all other versions of the EV6 will likely get less. Still plenty for daily driving, but some versions of the electric car will not be well suited for long road trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAJgDn"&gt;One way Kia is compensating for this is very fast charging, at least relative to the current state of electric vehicles. The E-GMP platform uses 800-volt battery packs, like what’s found in the Porsche Taycan, which makes it possible to charge an EV6 from 10 percent to 80 percent in just 18 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oV6mHGCG7pBcy_viuqXDUXGhOaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407216/Kia_EV6_GT_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgeNyR"&gt;Another is performance, at least for the AWD variants. The all-wheel drive GT version of the EV6 is the top spec, and only comes with the long range battery. It uses two motors to produce a combined 430kW, or roughly 576 horsepower, and can go from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ujYXwJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two-way charging, for all your outdoor excursions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MytAxO"&gt;What may be more exciting than performance or tech specs, though, is that the EV6 supports two-way charging just like Hyundai’s Ioniq 5. The EV6 can put out up to 3.6kW of power — enough to power a 55-inch TV and an air conditioner for more than 24 hours, Kia says. It’s not as powerful as, say, the 7.2kW version of the new hybrid Ford F-150’s optional onboard charger, but then again the EV6 doesn’t use gas to generate this power, and it will be a heck of a lot cheaper. Kia says the EV6 can also tow up to 1,600 kilograms (roughly 3,500 pounds) as long as the battery is more than 35 percent full, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_Kmx4Fzhm75Gh3tW0vhY7mFH2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407213/Kia_EV6_GT_Interior_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fOPV37"&gt;What will set the EV6 apart more than anything is its exterior styling. Kia calls it a crossover, which isn’t wrong. But it also has big hatchback vibes. From some rear angles, it bears some resemblance to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;the Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. From the side, it’s a longer, meaner Ioniq 5. It’s certainly not bubbly or unassuming, like many of the SUVs that currently make up Kia’s lineup. Rather, it’s aggressive without being ostentatious; eye-catching, if not eye-watering. In a world that’s increasingly full of big, bloated vehicles, the EV6 is a breath of fresh air — even if the E-GMP platform it uses will most certainly wind up powering larger vehicles for Kia and Hyundai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hc6Nka"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hyundai’s electric Ioniq 5 crossover could be the ultimate camping companion ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bPVjJA"&gt;The EV6’s interior is more familiar. There are two 12-inch curved displays that sit inside a structure that rises up from the dashboard, one in front of the driver and one for infotainment purposes. There’s also an augmented reality heads-up display that projects information into the driver’s field of view. Kia promises this will all be updatable over-the-air, and there are advanced driver assistance features to boot. Otherwise, the inside of the EV6 just looks like the inside of a Kia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4koejw"&gt;The Kia EV6, in some respects, looks to be a bold remaking of the company’s otherwise solid initial foray into the world of electric vehicles. But what Kia shared about the EV6 is almost as important as what it omitted. There is no word on pricing of the various configurations, and Kia also conveniently left out specs for what will certainly be the more affordable models. For such an important car, there remains a fair amount of mystery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Boh6Jg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo’s deal with Hyundai appears dead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNhRbIMT0jcf71XfSy4APjTwyPo=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69046133/Canoo_MPDV_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZWdxH"&gt;The deal between Canoo and Hyundai to build electric vehicles appears to be dead, as the California EV startup is moving away from trying to sell its electric vehicle technology to other automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btDNac"&gt;Canoo chairman Tony Aquila shared the news Monday during an icy investor call — Canoo’s first as a publicly-traded company. Canoo’s CEO was also absent from the call, and the company announced earlier in the day that its CFO had resigned &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000155837021003592/tmb-20210323x8k.htm"&gt;to take another job&lt;/a&gt; — the second major departure in recent weeks following Canoo losing its head of corporate strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsj7WM"&gt;“These are significant surprises on the call today, and that’s not ideal,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said at one point on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9o5Otu"&gt;The deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia"&gt;Hyundai was announced in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and it was supposed to result in both the Hyundai and Kia brands building vehicles on Canoo’s electric vehicle platform. It was seen as a major vote of confidence in the startup, which was just two years old at the time, as well as its tech. Canoo called it a “key partnership.” Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canoo did not respond beyond Aquila’s statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IRF8WN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s not ideal.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4OwgTL"&gt;Aquila took over Canoo as part of the startup’s merger with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; (SPAC) in 2020, which netted it around $600 million. Speaking obliquely at first, he said Monday that the startup’s board of directors decided to “de-emphasize” its “engineering services” line. This was the planned part of Canoo’s business that was supposed to see the startup provide technology to bigger companies that wanted to enter the electric vehicle space. Canoo’s desire to sell its technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;at one point even drew the interest of Apple, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqVes4"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390020033060/fs42020a1_hennessycapital4.htm"&gt;documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390021004077/f424b30121_canooinc.htm"&gt;before and after the merger&lt;/a&gt;, Canoo had said its planned engineering services business presented “a significant market for contract engineering services among legacy OEMs who lack the expertise to develop an electric powertrain at the pace needed to capitalize on the rising regulatory requirements and global demand for EVs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13zgnW"&gt;The startup also said these types of partnerships would serve as “concrete points of external validation for our technology and the talent of our team, as well as provide additional sources of revenue and long-term commercial opportunities.” Canoo said it was “in discussions with a number of other partners and expects to be in a position to announce many more partnerships in due course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIKRs4"&gt;But on Monday, Aquila said Canoo will now focus more on making and selling its own vehicles to commercial operators. The company has so far announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;delivery vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, and a van, all of which are built on the same underlying technological platform. Canoo will focus even less on the idea of selling its electric van to consumers through a subscription model — the original pitch when the startup broke cover in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tyMGn"&gt;Aquila has previously spoken about focusing more on selling to fleet operators and small businesses as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;opposed to customers&lt;/a&gt;, though it wasn’t until Monday that he explained just how far he is willing to take that strategy shift. To wit, Canoo &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/presentations"&gt;quietly uploaded a new investor presentation&lt;/a&gt; to its investor relations website on Monday that no longer mentions Hyundai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFkGqa"&gt;“We have so much demand for our three [vehicles], let’s get all that work done, and then let’s, you know, look at if there [are] partnerships,” he said. Aquila explained he believes that this will make for a more sound business with less risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nKFlb6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’ve got to be careful with statements you make.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFzt3k"&gt;When pressed on the startup’s previous claims about this part of its business, Aquila — who invested $35 million into Canoo before the SPAC merger — pointed to its prior leadership. Aquila said they were “a little more aggressive” than he would’ve been with some of their public statements, and that talk of potential partnerships was “presumptuous.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y21X2s"&gt;“You’ve got to be careful with statements you make. So, you know, again, I think it was a little premature,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHBnxu"&gt;While some of those executives are indeed now gone, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21277248/canoo-ev-startup-stefan-krause-leaving-evelozcity"&gt;cofounder and former CEO Stefan Krause&lt;/a&gt;, others remain — though they weren’t on Monday’s call. At one point Aquila was asked directly if Krause’s replacement, Canoo cofounder Ulrich Kranz, was still CEO. Aquila confirmed he is, though as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported late last year, Kranz’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;contract was recently renegotiated&lt;/a&gt; and he was removed from the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ho5bZ"&gt;Aquila said he believes the refocused business will help “protect” the intellectual property Canoo has developed, and that the original deal with Hyundai didn’t factor in the value of that IP. When one analyst asked if Aquila thinks Hyundai misappropriated any of Canoo’s IP, Aquila said “well I’ll leave it to you to make that decision.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ex88o0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwQnua"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXKqwr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjV3aW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s independent repair program is expanding to ‘nearly every country where Apple products are sold’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iphone 5 teardown (ifixit)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xCYE7QtWwTDVz4Xn3zzDP694JJk=/29x0:772x495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69045781/El6QfQ4IFThwHHqH.1419974202.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iphone 5 teardown (ifixit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9iaWg"&gt;Getting an Apple product repaired often involves going directly to the (expensive) source — an Apple Store — or a big third-party firm. If you live somewhere with limited choices, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22357187%2Fapple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced expansion&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20838307/apple-iphone-repairs-parts-independent-shops"&gt;Independent Repair Provider&lt;/a&gt; program might change that. The company plans to expand its repair program to “nearly every country where Apple products are sold,” meaning someone near you could soon be using official Apple parts to fix your cracked phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z3IiU"&gt;Right now, the program is only available in the US, Canada and Europe, but according to Apple’s announcement, repair providers from countries including Australia, Japan, and Korea will be able to join this week, with providers from even more countries including China joining the program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="352Pf4"&gt;Providers have to apply to participate, but once approved, they can only buy a limited variety of first-party materials like batteries, screens, and diagnostic tools. So while your local repair person will be able to fix the most common issues with official parts, anything more more exotic will have to go through Apple, one of its authorized service providers, or risk voiding a warranty or becoming unsupported down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HL8BsO"&gt;If you actually do the hard work of repairing devices, there’s other things to be aware of, too. Joining the program comes with a contract that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;reportedly gives Apple&lt;/a&gt; the right to both inspect repair shops and fine them if it finds something amiss. Apple can charge $1,000 per transaction for any shop it catches using knockoff parts in more than two percent of repairs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdgFqM"&gt;Apple generally only seems to be supportive of third-party repairs if it can find a way to make money off of them, and this repair program doesn’t seem to be any different. This is the company that routinely attempts to kill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;right-to-repair bills&lt;/a&gt; and has devised methods to make iPhones non-functional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;if they use third-party batteries&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkBzsR"&gt;You can read the full list of participating countries and regions &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22357187%2Fapple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;MSCHF&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Xfw8C"&gt;Nike has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880/gov.uscourts.nyed.461880.1.0.pdf"&gt;sued internet collective MSCHF&lt;/a&gt; for selling “unauthorized Satan Shoes” in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X. The shoe company says MSCHF infringed on its trademarks by selling limited-edition custom Nikes that were allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/style/nike-satan-shoes-lil-Nas-x.html"&gt;modified with a drop of human blood&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Satan Shoes (as they are officially called) were announced last week, Nike claims they’ve harmed its reputation, “including among consumers who believe that Nike is endorsing satanism.” It’s asking for the shoes to be destroyed and for MSCHF to pay financial damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frLAgR"&gt;MSCHF is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320127/mschf-products-jesus-shoes-puff-chicken-office-business"&gt;known for stunt products&lt;/a&gt; like its 2019 “Jesus Shoes,” a $1,425 pair of white Nike Air Max 97s with custom stitching and 60ccs of water from the River Jordan. Nike didn’t object to the Jesus Shoes. But it’s apparently less happy with their theological inverse: a 666-pair drop of $1,018 red and black Air Max 97s, containing 60ccs of ink and one drop of human blood, embellished with a pentagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="A0d9Pf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nike says a devil shoe made with literal blood is bad for its brand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tigwl"&gt;Nike’s suit makes a few general arguments against modifying shoes, including that “making changes to the midsole may pose safety risks for consumers.” (These shoes stand accused of putting people’s souls &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;their soles at risk.) But it mostly argues that a satanic shoe containing literal blood is bad for Nike’s brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ddmcp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MSCHF x Lil Nas X "Satan Shoes"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nike Air Max '97&lt;br&gt; Contains 60cc ink and 1 drop of human blood&lt;br&gt; ️666 Pairs, individually numbered&lt;br&gt; $1,018&lt;br&gt; ️March 29th, 2021 &lt;a href="https://t.co/XUMA9TKGSX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XUMA9TKGSX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SAINT (@saint) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saint/status/1375532655551389696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DC6wHP"&gt;To make its case, Nike cites social media comments from people who don’t realize MSCHF was just unofficially reselling the shoes. “Won’t buy Nike again. You are banned!” says one. “This is sickening!!! How is Nike not involved when there’s a Nike symbol on the shoe!!!” says another. “MSCHF is deceiving consumers into believing that Nike manufactures or approves of the Satan Shoes,” Nike’s complaint claims. “Consumers’ belief that the Satan Shoes are genuine Nike products is causing consumers to never want to purchase any Nike products in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAwVAN"&gt;As University of New Hampshire law professor Alexandra Roberts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lexlanham/status/1376648694850801669"&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, MSCHF can defend itself on multiple grounds. It can cite the First Sale Doctrine, which protects reselling goods that are protected by intellectual property laws — like people selling designer clothes on Poshmark, for instance. It can also claim the shoes are protected as a parody or argue that buyers are unlikely to confuse these modified Satan Shoes with off-the-shelf Nikes, random internet commenters notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Whd6cD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How is Nike not involved when there’s a Nike symbol on the shoe!!!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a4qCbK"&gt;Very, very few people will ever own a $1,000 blood-and-pentagram sneaker. If the case goes to trial, though, there’s more than a limited-edition satanic shoe line at stake. “The case has potentially broad implications because we’re seeing a rise in this kind of customization of branded goods as well as upcycling,” Roberts told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; via email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nike’s legal exhibit distinguishing standard Nike shoe from “unauthorized Satan Shoe”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCD9l551DV_WlLU8LxbUNSjFM0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406803/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_7.20.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nike&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrm5Bb"&gt;It’s fine to directly resell products, Roberts says, and it’s legal to advertise goods while mentioning somebody else’s trademark. You can also do things like &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-08-14-0108140233-story.html"&gt;dismember Barbie dolls and sell pictures of them as art&lt;/a&gt;. “But what about the businesses making jewelry out of authentic Chanel buttons, or cutting fringes into genuine Vuitton bags?” Earlier this year, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/chanel-is-suing-shriver-duke-over-jewelry-made-from-authentic-logo-bearing-buttons/"&gt;Chanel sued a company&lt;/a&gt; for “misappropriating” its brand for recycled button earrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGpxXS"&gt;Basically, MSCHF bought shoes that it could legally resell using Nike’s branding, but it heavily modified them into what’s arguably a new product whose quality Nike can’t control, then sold them as a commercial good rather than a traditional art piece. Depending on how a court weighs all those factors, it could create a precedent for future cases. “I think other high fashion brands will be keeping a close eye on this case,” Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RUcMVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think other high fashion brands will be keeping a close eye on this case.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6lzdWA"&gt;The Satan Shoes dropped alongside a provocative Lil Nas X music video that’s &lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a35966473/lil-nas-x-apology-montero-satan-blood-sneakers-controversy-explained/"&gt;drawn the ire&lt;/a&gt; of conservative commentators. So it makes sense that Nike might distance itself. But &lt;a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/mschfs-nike-branded-sneakers-injected-with-human-blood-raise-some-interesting-legal-issues/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;The Fashion Law&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, MSCHF has anticipated and even invited lawsuits in the past, saying a suit would “help increase the value of the product.” By taking it to court, Nike is almost certainly boosting the profile of MSCHF’s latest drop, as well as potentially causing new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUikCR"&gt;“I’m not shocked Nike chose to sue, but I think they might also want to proceed with caution to avoid being perceived as squelching speech or siding with the Christian right over a popular Black artist,” says Roberts. “I expect Nike might be hoping for a quick, low-key settlement in which MSCHF agrees not to ship out the shoes.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Unauthorized Satan Shoe” exhibit, Nike lawsuit" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxFn3SvEcQsMamwJQI1u53WelbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406838/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_7.46.16_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OWgf9m"&gt;MSCHF didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Lil Nas X, who posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESf8Un3g9zM"&gt;a prank “apology” video&lt;/a&gt; for the shoes yesterday, is not named as a defendant in the suit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Louvre’s collections are online so I curated some good paintings for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by MARTIN BUREAU/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EZ77ur"&gt;The Louvre Museum &lt;a href="https://presse.louvre.fr/the-musee-du-louvre-launches-online-collection-database-and-new-website/"&gt;announced Friday&lt;/a&gt; that its entire collections are now available to view online at &lt;a href="http://collections.louvre.fr"&gt;collections.louvre.fr&lt;/a&gt;. This includes pieces that are on loan or in storage, which is exciting for museum nerds like me who have ever expressed woe at the number of cool things museums have kept away from my eager eyeballs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuhVN5"&gt;“The site offers several ways to delve into the collections: simple or advanced searches, entries by curatorial department, and themed albums,” says the press release. I humbly offer another way to delve in: hand-selected links to some paintings of animals that should tickle your whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7pp8Z"&gt;The Louvre’s terms of use for their photos indicate that I can’t repost them from their site, and I would strongly prefer not to start a fresh fight with the French. Instead, I will describe a sampling of paintings for you and let you make the decision as to whether you’ll click through and marvel at them yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Udc9TB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010066422"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monkey painter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps: A monkey, dressed in 17th century garb and holding a paint palette and brushes, focuses solemnly on its canvas as it delicately applies a brushstroke. The colors are somber in tone and, for reasons unbeknownst to me, there is a gun hanging on the wall. If you look through a doorway to the left you can see another monkey, perhaps his assistant, toiling away at a low bench. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UdN36x"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010065256"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter as a satyr with Antiope and their twins Amphion and Zethus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Vincent Sellaer: A very pale nude woman sits among a bunch of weird looking toddlers, while an extremely creepy satyr (typical Jupiter) lurks in the background. There’s a cat in the lower left corner, tucked under the elbow of one of the toddlers. The cat is not exactly the subject of this piece, but there is a detail shot of its face for you to click on — clearly the Louvre knows what we’re here for. According to the description, translated from French, the cat “may be a sign of sensuality or even lust.” Sure, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uLiX78"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010064917"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saint Jerome in meditation, with his lion, skull, books, vase of flowers and hourglass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Georg Pencz: Again, the feline is not the subject here, but it is the star of the show nonetheless. A long-bearded St. Jerome sits among his morbid accoutrements, while a lion sits in shadow behind him with one paw placed on his hip. There’s a twinkle in the lion’s eye, perhaps a smirk on its lip. What is this lion thinking? Why are its claws so prominent? What schemes are being plotted behind its gently furrowed brow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PUXJYW"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010057845"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dog and game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Christophe Huet: If there’s any painting I deeply wish I could zoom, screenshot, and share, it’s this one. A dog sits guarding a collection of freshly hunted game, including a hare, a duck, and some pheasants. It snarls at another dog, which appears to be mid-stride, with a dopey expression that can only be read as &lt;em&gt;Who, me? &lt;/em&gt;I love you funky dog, and I hope you were able to get some good snacks eventually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="sWuom4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A modder made a way to mine bitcoin on a Game Boy (very, very slowly)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwnOitTZZIJ-UZZcoTNtyFXcSNE=/206x0:2309x1402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69045134/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_1.23.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: StackSmashing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WYXJzP"&gt;If your desire to mine bitcoin has been thwarted by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;lack of GPU stock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333544/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-rate-limit-unlock-driver"&gt;flimsy BIOS locks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ckjr9x214c"&gt;YouTuber StackSmashing&lt;/a&gt; may be able to help. They’ve made a Game Boy miner, which only needs a Game Boy console (and a slightly modified Link Cable), a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/21/22242619/raspberry-pi-pico-microcontroller-tiny-computer-diy-projects"&gt;Raspberry Pi Pico&lt;/a&gt;, and a regular computer (&lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/mine-bitcoin-game-boy-raspberry-pi"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97qdGg"&gt;The conceit of the project is that all of the mining happens on a stock Game Boy, which was released a full 20 years before bitcoin was invented. Of course, it does need some help: the Game Boy can’t actually connect to the internet, and it can’t hold the entire blockchain. To deal with that, StackSmashing uses the Pico and Link Cable to connect to the computer, which is running a bitcoin node. After it’s connected, the Game Boy runs the hashing program from a programmable cartridge, and even plays a fun animation while it’s mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jwg6jp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ckjr9x214c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n3IiXi"&gt;Given that the Game Boy is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; slower than today’s dedicated mining machines (it apparently runs at 0.8 hashes per second, while some of the fastest ASIC miners run &lt;em&gt;125 trillion times&lt;/em&gt; faster, &lt;a href="https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/microbt/whatsminer-m30s-1"&gt;at 100 terahashes per second&lt;/a&gt;), it’s astronomically unlikely that StackSmashing would be able to actually mine any bitcoins. However, when they set up a new bitcoin blockchain with no records on it, they were able to confirm that yes, the Game Boy was able to successfully mine blocks. Who’s ready for GameCoin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c6d8Kr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;„it’s without a doubt the slowest miner I’ve ever heard of”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But you have heard of it!” &lt;a href="https://t.co/wJENJ1xLW7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wJENJ1xLW7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— stacksmashing (@ghidraninja) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ghidraninja/status/1376269148918013953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
