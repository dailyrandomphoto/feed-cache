    <title>Amazon’s game streaming service Luna is opening access to all Prime members June 21 and 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqBmj6HQn-51xq9r_A8BWaQDca8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448422/_DSC6805_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpEjfk"&gt;Amazon is opening up access to its game streaming service Luna &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=23494951011"&gt;to all Amazon Prime members on June 21 and 22&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon Prime Day). Previously, to test out Luna you had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;request access or sign up&lt;/a&gt; from supported Fire TV devices. But for this limited-time only, any Prime subscribers in the mainland US will be able to start a 7-day trial of Luna right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWQTsE"&gt;Luna is available on Windows PC, Mac, Fire TV, and via the web on iPhone, iPad, and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177222/amazon-luna-android-cloud-gaming-google-pixel-samsung-oneplus"&gt;select Android phones&lt;/a&gt;.” Regular pricing is $5.99 a month for access to games including &lt;em&gt;Control, GRID&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;. Or, once you’ve got a Luna account, you can pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel. This gets you access to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21494096011"&gt;big range of Ubisoft games&lt;/a&gt;, including the latest titles from the &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed, FarCry, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Watch Dogs &lt;/em&gt;franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d5l15l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hands-on with Amazon’s Luna game streaming service","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mmlwvU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/14/amazon-luna-invite-free-prime-day/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon is also discounting its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated Luna controller&lt;/a&gt; by 30 percent from June 14 to June 22, and knocking $40 off a bundle package including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-Stick-Controller/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna controller and Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rICZw1"&gt;If you’re a Prime member and have been curious to see how Luna stacks up against Microsoft’s xCloud or Google Stadia, this is a good opportunity to check it out. Modify your expectations, though. In our early preview of Luna in October last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;we found that the service was very hit and miss&lt;/a&gt;: games load fast, but the library of available titles is small and internet speeds of at least 25Mbps are necessary for smooth play.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google to work with UK regulators on its big ad-tracking shakeup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_VBIXNjgkyficXMslltkky3dwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448384/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jzx9Qx"&gt;The UK’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will collaborate with Google as it attempts to rework online ad targeting, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-have-key-oversight-role-over-google-s-planned-removal-of-third-party-cookies"&gt;the regulator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have announced. It comes as Google is attempting to phase out the use of third-party cookies for tracking and targeting users with ads and instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;use a new set of technologies&lt;/a&gt; it’s calling Privacy Sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch5sIJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Google said this is the first time regulators and technology companies have worked together on new technologies like this. As well as the CMA, the UK’s data protection regulator (the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO) will also be involved. “The CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech firms to shape their behaviour and protect competition to the benefit of consumers,” the CMA’s chief executive Andrea Coscelli, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7lK3Ds"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The CMA is taking a leading role in setting out how we can work with the most powerful tech firms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MABbEV"&gt;The collaboration comes in response to the CMA’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-google-s-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes"&gt;announcement in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would be formally investigating Google’s proposals, which involve using AI to bundle users together into anonymised groups to target them with ads (you can read more about the proposals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Google’s new approach is intended as a more privacy-orientated alternative to tracking cookies, which the company intends to phase out of its Chrome browser &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;over the next year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZrPUQ"&gt;However, concerns have been raised that Google’s Privacy Sandbox could harm competition, and concentrate yet more power in the hands of the search giant. There have also been concerns raised about whether the proposals are compatible with Europe’s tough &lt;a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/google-will-not-run-floc-origin-tests-in-europe-due-to-gdpr-concerns/"&gt;GDPR data protection regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the plans are also facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333848/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-complaint-chrome-privacy"&gt;antitrust scrutiny in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYD7Jx"&gt;Google has made a series of commitments to the UK regulator about how it will develop and implement the changes. It says it will develop the plans transparently, in a way that doesn’t give itself an unfair advantage, or discriminate against its rivals. It’s also making a commitment to not combine user data from Chrome browsing histories or Google Analytics with its ad products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGXePG"&gt;For its part, the CMA says these commitments address its concerns, but it’s opening up a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-proposed-commitments-in-respect-of-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes"&gt;public consultation&lt;/a&gt; to help it decide whether to accept them. If accepted, the commitments would become legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it hasn’t decided whether to halt Galaxy S21 FE production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKx6rJfWPBvv-CF_SNEt38S-44U=/0x0:970x647/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448284/s21fe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An alleged render of the Galaxy S21 FE. | OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NIbrGO"&gt;Samsung has downplayed a report that claimed the company has suspended production of an upcoming phone called the Galaxy S21 FE. Korean publication &lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt; alleged over the weekend that production of the unannounced phone had stopped because of a shortage of semiconductors, and that Qualcomm processors had been reallocated to foldable devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyY0S7"&gt;The report has since been deleted, and Samsung now says it hasn’t made a decision on whether to halt production. In a statement texted &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/samsung-halts-production-of-new-phone-on-chip-shortage-et-says"&gt;to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, the company says “While we cannot discuss details of the unreleased product, nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IrGspR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE review: the right price for the right stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d5ZIZ1"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE — the FE stands for Fan Edition — was expected to be a cut-down, more affordable version of the regular S21. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn gave the Galaxy S20 FE a positive review&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it had “a few high-quality components that will delight while the cheaper parts don’t hurt the experience too much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9oMx4"&gt;The S21 FE hadn’t been formally announced, but Samsung did say at an event last year that it planned to release Fan Editions of flagship phones going forward. OnLeaks posted alleged renders of the S21 FE back in April, showing a similar design to the well-received Galaxy S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzWE9d"&gt;While it’s noteworthy that Samsung didn’t deny &lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt;’ report outright, it may take some time before the truth emerges. The S20 FE wasn’t announced until September last year and got a release in October, so even if Samsung is experiencing supply chain issues with its successor right now, a launch wasn’t necessarily imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oa1-khhYmtqlpCAP5VnzRqPRboc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386792/acastro_180604_1777_E3_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;E3 2021 is finally here. After being canceled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, E3 is back for 2021 in an all-digital format, and it kicked off on June 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZLqrf"&gt;There’s been a lot of great announcements so far, including a trailer and release date for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531110/ubisoft-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;a trailer for Ubisoft’s gorgeous &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;a release date for Microsoft and Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532295/final-fantasy-origins-square-enix-team-ninja-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;the reveal of a chaos-filled and action-heavy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The six coolest games from the PC Gaming Show at E3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jo5C1G05OzmIpbfIFgCGrG1eqDo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69447597/ss_744bc2c09d80209c4ebf8e6e51d2acbf39aff879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Always Run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6MbfUL"&gt;The second day of E3 2021 has been busy with Xbox and Bethesda’s joint conference followed by Square Enix’s showcase, but plenty more game announcements came from the PC Gaming Show. If you don’t have time to catch up on the whole 90 minutes, we’ve rounded up a few of our highlights of intriguing and upcoming games that you’ll want to wishlist on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J5m6Yb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rawmen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="eCsYFN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJe9JgVCxAM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pI3Znq"&gt;Basically &lt;em&gt;Splatoon &lt;/em&gt;but with food, &lt;em&gt;Rawmen&lt;/em&gt; is a third-person arena shooter where instead of guns, you fight with food against up to two to eight players. Sling soup at your opponents, become a human meatball by jumping into meat juice and rolling your way back home, or launch yourself in the air with doughnut bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VwJ7gL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They Always Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="bgj020"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4DIqCzQOGs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aeKgWS"&gt;This space Western 2D action game sees you playing a three-armed mutant hunting dangerous bounties across the galaxy. From the visuals, the animation, the music, it’s just dripping with style, and plenty of ultra-violence as you hack and slash your way through each level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRZvp9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far: Changing Tides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="xOBhi7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OU6PWXj-luQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xU9x6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far: Lone Sails&lt;/em&gt; was a minimal, lonely, but powerfully meditative experience as you charted journey across a post-apocalyptic environment with nothing but yourself and a unique hunk of a junk of a vehicle. So a sequel, &lt;em&gt;Far: Changing Tides&lt;/em&gt; comes as a lovely surprise. It looks even more beautiful, and this time you’re piloting a ship across a flooded world, while still trying to keep your machine moving forward by salvaging ship parts during your travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YHz40H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next Space Rebels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="jbxfSf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FU7wOA2iMs4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W3Llz6"&gt;A space rocket-building sim with a narrative, &lt;em&gt;Next Space Rebels&lt;/em&gt; has the feel of a DIY amateur’s &lt;em&gt;Kerbal Space Program&lt;/em&gt;, as you try to put together a rocket engine that can actually launch. Tied to this simulation however is a story conveyed through FMV cutscenes, as fictitious hacker group Next Space Rebels urge the global community to build and launch rockets themselves, and “democratize the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EIewkg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soulstice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="IULkvj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0Lqeig-BXY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbWJ0"&gt;The name may imply a shameless Souls clone, but Italian developer Reply Game Studios is also taking inspiration from Japanese character-action games like &lt;em&gt;Devil May Cry&lt;/em&gt;, as well as early ‘80s anime. Another influence may be PlatinumGames’ &lt;em&gt;Astral Chain&lt;/em&gt;, as you’re controlling two characters simultaneously; two sisters called Briar and Lute, one possessing superhuman strength, the other a ghost with mystical powers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rqunso"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemnis Gate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="uYRqvc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lbqqEBLpd0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5CUYdX"&gt;This turn-based time-looping first-person shooter tasks you to take control of each of your team members one at a time playing a round that lasts just 25 seconds. It was first announced last year but its release is just around the corner as the latest trailer has confirmed &lt;em&gt;Lemnis Gate&lt;/em&gt; is coming on August 3rd to PC, as well as PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. An open beta is also coming in July, so players can get their heads around just how this time-bending gameplay works.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Panther is coming to Marvel’s Avengers this August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyt-rAq1UBUAcAlfMtd4JEeiRTU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69447115/MarvelsAvengers_E3SEP_BlackPanther.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bR50up"&gt;Previously announced for &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers, &lt;/em&gt;today’s Square Enix E3 Showcase gave a first proper look at Black Panther who joins the superhero roster in a brand new expansion, &lt;em&gt;War For Wakanda&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNFJUw"&gt;A new cinematic trailer introduces the King of Wakanda himself — although his face is not shown clearly until he puts on his Black Panther mask. He will be defending Wakanda from Klaw, who has infiltrated Wakanda in order to steal Vibranium for his own plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cftuE5"&gt;The trailer page indicates that &lt;em&gt;War For Wakanda&lt;/em&gt; will release this August. The Black Panther expansion will be free to players who already own &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers&lt;/em&gt; on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One. The expansion had supposedly been planned for release earlier but was delayed due to the sad and sudden passing of Chadwick Boseman, who played the superhero in the Marvel film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyfTAl"&gt;Elsewhere in Marvel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22519348/guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-square-enix-eidos-montreal-release-date"&gt;Square Enix also announced today that Eidos Montreal is making a &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, slated to launch this October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Co-op action game Babylon’s Fall finally gets gameplay trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtMaeRDpuK-GRDqcTMwg4G2MBcA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69447091/Babylon_s_Fall_cutscene_03.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7rCDcy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babylon’s Fall&lt;/em&gt; finally has a substantial gameplay trailer, which was revealed at Square Enix’s E3 2021 Showcase. The new trailer is the first time it’s been seen since the game was first announced in 2018. Players will team up tackling challenging dungeons in an attempt to scale the titular tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQKNPk"&gt;The co-op title is developed by PlatinumGames and can be played solo or with up to four players. Besides the studio’s trademark hi-octane melee action, the new footage from the fantasy title shows that players can wield ranged weapons like magic staffs and bows. Their powers and customization is also based on a special equipment called the Gideon Coffin worn on their backs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S06HyT"&gt;The developers confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Babylon’s Fall &lt;/em&gt;is a live-service title that will feature a range of post launch game modes at no additional cost. Sign-ups are also taking place for a closed beta, which you can register via the &lt;a href="https://www.babylonsfall.com/beta/"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKzesK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babylon’s Fall&lt;/em&gt; was first announced at Square Enix’s E3 conference in 2018, where it was confirmed for PS4 and PC. Little else has been heard about the game, apart from another teaser over a year later, while PlatinumGames assured fans last year that the game was still in development. The game is now also coming to PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square Enix announces action-heavy spinoff Final Fantasy Origin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5FxPk40AlbMhHz-i43-msufYYR4=/118x0:834x477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69447046/Screen_Shot_2021_06_13_at_4.11.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JU67bO"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff is heavy on the action, and certainly doesn’t skimp when it comes to giant swords. At its E3 2021 keynote, Square Enix revealed &lt;em&gt;Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin&lt;/em&gt; — yes, that’s the actual full title — which is billed as a collaboration between &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; veterans Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima, and renowned action game studio Team Ninja. You can get a sense of the action in the trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PCBWK"&gt;It’s not clear how, exactly, the game ties back to the rest of the franchise, but the description certainly sounds very &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tMcDuD"&gt;With the memory of their struggle buried deep in their hearts... Jack and his allies, Ash and Jed, burn with resolve to defeat Chaos as they throw open the gates to the Chaos Shrine. Yet doubts remain — are they truly the Warriors of Light the prophecy foretold?   Step into a world of dark fantasy and revel in the exhilarating, action-packed battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CfqVli"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The blood of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; runs through its veins.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKcnGG"&gt;In a statement, Nomura said that “While it is &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, it feels different — but there’s no doubt that the blood of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; runs through its veins. We’ve undertaken the challenge of finding this difficult middle ground for this mature and stylish title. We need a little time until we’re able to complete it, and while the battle system is a bloody one, it does link to the story, so I hope you’ll use this opportunity to give it a try.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hC8bg"&gt;The game is slated to launch in 2022 for the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, though &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA03657_00-SOPFFORIGINTRIAL"&gt;a PS5 demo&lt;/a&gt; will be available from now until June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy 1-6 are being rereleased for new ‘pixel remaster series’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6VFDpFwimFnBb7Sl26KNeGa0l8=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69446995/FFPR_FF1_6_Logos.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z5Ey0f"&gt;Square Enix announced that the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xMKSh3GF9c"&gt;first six mainline &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games are getting remasters&lt;/a&gt; for Steam, Android, and iOS. The games will each be released individually as part of the “Pixel Remaster Series,” but Square Enix hasn’t shared release timing beyond the fact that they’re “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FB2g0Q"&gt;In a tweet, Square Enix said that the games will be getting a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1404160830082629636"&gt;pixel-perfect makeover&lt;/a&gt;,” which makes it sound as if these games will be improved versions of the originals that retain the original visual style (as opposed to the 3D remasters). But because Square Enix hasn’t shared much info just yet, we’ll just have to wait for the company to announce more information until we can be sure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eidos Montreal is making a Guardians of the Galaxy game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5bs9ceKboKeLZtbJMgP77C8RLE=/121x0:924x535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69446939/Screen_Shot_2021_06_13_at_3.23.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5o7vH2"&gt;The team behind the &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; games is tackling one of Marvel’s most famous superhero groups next. At its E3 2021 keynote, publisher Square Enix revealed that Eidos Montreal, the studio behind games like &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/em&gt;, is working on a game titled simply &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DIguR"&gt;The game puts players in the role of Star Lord (aka Peter Quill) in a third-person action-adventure experience. In a unique twist, Peter will be joined by the rest of the Guardians at all times, with the likes of Groot and Rocket being AI companions. The story takes place several years after some kind of intergalactic war, when the Guardians are still a relatively fresh group, having been together for less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4rYJw"&gt;Eidos also says that choice will play a large part: as the team’s de factor leader, you’ll have to make decisions that impact the story. During one sequence, for instance, you’ll have to decide whether to sell Rocket or Groot to some kind of monster collector. (Curiously, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338970/guardians-of-the-galaxy-telltale-game-episode-one-review"&gt;the Guardians were previously featured in a choice-based adventure game from Telltale back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.) Early gameplay footage shows a game filled with big shooter battles, colorful worlds, plenty of ‘80s music, weird alien monsters, sleek starships, and lots of banter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uNrHAx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7e5nAUvxIs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n3W6Cu"&gt;This isn’t Square Enix’s first foray into Marvel, as the publisher previously released an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; game primarily developed by Crystal Dynamics (Eidos Montreal also assisted on that game). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21422708/marvel-avengers-review-single-player-campaign-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;Despite a well-received single-player campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the game was saddled with live-service elements and microtransactions that were largely criticized. &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, will be entirely single-player, with no add-on DLC or microtransactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ja0gH"&gt;Marvel games don’t necessarily have the strongest track record, though that has been slowly changing. Most notably, Sony studio Insomniac released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17817392/spider-man-marvel-ps4-review"&gt;an excellent take on Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;, and followed it up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549085/spider-man-miles-morales-review-ps5-ps4"&gt;an equally excellent spinoff starring Miles Morales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXSCm0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; launches on October 26th for the PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
