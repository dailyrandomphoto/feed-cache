  &lt;p id="PpkqH6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is always interested in the future — so this week, we’re taking a look at the people who will live there. All week, we’re going to publish stories focused on young people, whether they’re pushing for immigration reform or making bank in the online vintage trade. The way we see it, they’re building the future, and they’re using technology to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNQ2Jo"&gt;We’re calling the series Next Gen, like a next-gen camera or phone. The hope is that human beings will get a little better each time around, with fewer of the hang-ups that plagued earlier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tw4gT"&gt;To kick it off, we’re going to hear from some of those young people firsthand. In a series of four personal essays, we asked young writers to talk about the tech that’s made the biggest impact on their lives, from YouTube videos to multiplayer gaming rigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwaD4N"&gt;By the end of the week, you should have a pretty good sense of what the younger generations are up to — and what kind of future they’re building.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are $179 in-store at Staples through the rest of July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JO7oHSR_IYqNGPb2bEMYZMaxoks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632701/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6mOlzf"&gt;Staples is hosting some stellar back-to-school deals this week, especially if tech is on your checklist. &lt;a href="https://www.staplesconnect.com/weeklyad"&gt;The AirPods Pro are $179&lt;/a&gt; (visible on the third page of the ad) and are available at this price in-store only. Originally $249, these have been falling in price, but it’s not often that they sell for less than $189. It’s worth mentioning that Staples is also offering &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-homepod-mini-my5g2ll-a-bluetooth-speaker-space-gray%2Fproduct_24490472%3FcmArea%3DCIRCULAR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini for $89&lt;/a&gt;, which ties for the lowest price yet. Unlike the AirPods Pro, Staples is offering this miniature smart speaker in-store or online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJdyMF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613508"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw4_3VG4v2GjDGnC1mF-JdVVSGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13357959/newpencil.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rdv4sj"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15182548-apple-pencil-2nd-generation-new-99-at-best-buy?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SlickdealsnetFP+%28Slickdeals+Frontpage%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the second-generation Apple Pencil that’s compatible with iPads that have a USB-C port is $99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747302599779291212" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (delivery at Amazon currently delayed to August 12th). This is $30 lower than its usual price, and students who want to take notes during class should hop on this deal. Compared to the first-generation Apple Pencil that clumsily recharges via an iPad’s Lightning port, this one magnetically attaches to the side of your iPad to power up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="stPQSS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s offering deals on many of its accessories, including screen protectors, cases, Bluetooth keyboard cases, and USB-C hubs. You can shop on Brydge’s site or Amazon for the deals. Here are the most appealing offers so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bTgbvG"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XWRPVHD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brydge’s 10.2 Max Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a wireless keyboard with a spacious trackpad made for the seventh and eighth-generation iPad, costs $100 (usually $130) at Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about it in Sam Byford’s review of the larger 12.9-inch version made for the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is unfortunately not discounted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="skYMEI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Wireless-Keyboard-Trackpad-Bluetooth/dp/B0865JB97F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Brydge 11 Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, a wireless keyboard with a trackpad made for the iPad Pro (11-inch), costs $120 at Amazon (usually $150). The model that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Wireless-Keyboard-Trackpad-Bluetooth/dp/B0865KQ772/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can fit a 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $140&lt;/a&gt; (usually $170).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GouDWhSa_xi55ApMZOW0mqH9_fI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21788157/dseifert_200819_4156_0008.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="B1iM3Q"&gt;The Brydge 10.5 Go Plus, a wireless keyboard with a trackpad that’s made for the Microsoft Surface Go and Go 2, costs $100 at Amazon. It’s usually $140. The bigger &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Wireless-Precision-Compatible-Microsoft/dp/B08CWTKZQV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.3 Pro Plus made for the Surface Pro 4-7 models is $130&lt;/a&gt;, down from $150 at Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377083/brydge-12-3-pro-10-5-go-plus-surface-keyboard-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the 10.5 Go Plus and 12.3 Pro Plus in Dan Seifert’s review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zh4BTx"&gt;Anker is offering a solid deal on its 20W Nano USB-C wall charger that includes a six-foot Lightning to USB-C cable. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P544KWF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can get the two together for $24&lt;/a&gt;, down from $30. Considering that Apple’s similarly powerful 20W charger costs $19 by itself and doesn’t include a fast-charging cable, this bundle stands out as a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iR94Gy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10669653" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: Parsec</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thRznQRmo7Rh_6hL0sJ0954sHZ8=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632644/VRG_4679_Parsec_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new tool for an older kind of gaming&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="9r1Bse"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1BzlFi"&gt;In my corner of the Bronx, March 2020 felt like the end of the world. A statewide emergency was declared on March 7th, and the city went into lockdown 13 days later, as case numbers climbed higher each day. Before lockdown, I’d been going to an esports venue nearly twice a week to play in Super Smash Bros. tournaments, but that quickly dropped out of my routine. I had just gotten a library card, too, to make more time for reading. Now the card was useless, and trips outdoors became rare. As soon as I had laid out a plan for getting productive, the world pushed me back inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dKxrM"&gt;Being stuck inside wasn’t as bad for my social life as you might think. I spent more time on Discord, seeking out new channels and new people. Some of them were streamers, others voice actors — all of them people I would have been unlikely to meet offline. Some of them became my closest friends, which made me even more anxious to find new ways to connect and spend time with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="kG9nPl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mtxxoF"&gt;Eventually, my friends from college introduced me to &lt;a href="https://parsec.app/"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt;. In simple terms, Parsec is an application that lets you screen-share your PC to anyone you wish. By creating a link to your Parsec, you can let another Parsec user see your screen and interact with it, a step beyond the basic screen shares in apps like Zoom and Discord. Linked Parsec users can even connect keyboards or controllers virtually to the host system and the app will treat them like locally connected peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4TGBE"&gt;Put it all together and it becomes a new way to play games online. A lot of games from older systems like the GameCube and Wii didn’t have online functionality, but they have local multiplayer built in. Combine Parsec with an emulator like Dolphin and a whole new world of console games opens up — games I’d never been able to play with someone who wasn’t in the same room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2m4h0B"&gt;We started out with Mario Party, which led to some hilarious moments. (You’ve never seen a player truly break until you’ve seen all of their earnings being given to someone else through Chance Time.) We played the older generation of Super Smash Bros. games, too, before moving on to Mario Kart: Double Dash and GoldenEye. Parsec became a way to relive the aesthetic of an earlier generation of games, providing raw, harmless fun without an overburdened story or gestures at real-world relevance. So many rivalries were born, and so many friendships were tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PNP6e8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parsec became a way to relive the aesthetic of an earlier generation of games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="369Vcr"&gt;I usually played with friends from college, and those games became some of the best memories I’ve shared with them. I had known most of them for more than a year, so we already had a good rapport, and a sense of just how much smack talk we could get past each other. We kept a Discord channel open while we played, solely for the purpose of throwing jabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFCca5"&gt;Parsec’s biggest limitation is that it requires both the host and the remote user to have strong internet connections. If either one is out of whack, then it can cause lag on that side of the game. Lag on the host side is particularly bad since it causes downstream problems for everyone in the session. (I highly recommend connecting an ethernet cable to the system you’re using since a little lag can create a lot of embarrassment.) Since I had a wired connection, I would usually end up hosting. But occasional issues on my end still caused a whole game to stutter. Still, that’s the only real problem with Parsec, and it’s more of a general cloud-gaming problem than a specific issue with the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bCxpAr"&gt;Parsec is a one-track app, aimed at serving a simple purpose: remote multiplayer gaming. In some ways, it’s a simple problem to solve, but solving it well gave me a lot of happiness during what was otherwise a very hard year. Whenever I wasn’t working on writing or trawling the internet for content to watch, I would end up booting up a game and trying to get a Parsec session going. It happened nearly every day. When I think of my favorite moments from 2020, a lot of them were routed through Parsec, playing an older generation of games with newfound friends — and feeling, if only for a moment, that we were all in one room together.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: the Alicia Keys Tiny Desk concert</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fl3uKgNZSTOfzG81T7UUOdC0j9Y=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632570/VRG_4679_YT_Alicia_Keys_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking for the thrill of live music during lockdown, I turned to NPR&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="NDkD8V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t6e1CQ"&gt;Life is weird: one minute I’m dancing in a concert mosh pit, happily crammed among strangers like a sardine in a can, and then &lt;em&gt;bam&lt;/em&gt; — pandemic. The can tilts, the music stops, and I’m flopping around without the thrill and connection of live music at a packed venue, my favorite place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqFjXK"&gt;But since lockdown, I’ve managed to find one important substitute: NPR’s Tiny Desk concerts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rGF9I"&gt;Tiny Desk concerts are exactly what they sound like: an artist performs while residing behind, well, a rather tiny desk. The series has been running since 2008, starting with indie acts like Dr. Dog and the Avett Brothers, and moving to huge names like Taylor Swift and Megan Thee Stallion in recent years. The setting is casual, the performance is laid-back — it can be as basic as an artist and an instrument — and the songs are often stripped to their core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="9oJ6Jk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9I23gU"&gt;Big deal, right? Actually, I’m so glad you asked. It’s a huge deal, even if it doesn’t seem like much at first glance. Though I appreciate the in-your-face experience of a concert (it’s hard to forget your boyfriend dragging you from a mosh pit after getting hit in the face), the magic of Tiny Desk is in its simplicity. It’s just music and people in a room, a pairing very much missed for the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWdqY0"&gt;Many of my favorite Tiny Desk concerts were released toward the beginning of the pandemic. There’s King Princess’ gentle serenade, and Harry Styles’ playful laughter as he cracks jokes with the audience — two videos that fill me with an incomparable warmth, time and time again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4of1f"&gt;But the one that’s stuck with me for the longest time is a performance by Alicia Keys. Recorded in February of 2020 and published the following June, the video begins with Keys telling the audience that she “just wanted to vibe out” with them. And vibe out she does. Everything about this performance — from her invitation for the audience to join her as she sings, to her unwavering smile as she plays along with her band — is exactly what music is about: coexisting with the ones around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sU62FW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwUt1fVLb3E?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BtrZCM"&gt;As she plays the introductory chords to her song “Show Me Love,” Keys speaks about needing love “more than ever before” because “that’s really what links us.” I remember getting chills despite the unbearable summer heat, thinking how heart-wrenching it was that her call for unity had been recorded a month before the world went into lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXnaLM"&gt;I think that’s what I cherish most about this performance. It was uploaded during a time when the world was in desperate need of love, and Alicia Keys gave me an awful lot to cling to. It wasn’t just the wisdom and mindfulness she demonstrated through the duration of the show, but the way she poured her soul into the music and how she embraced the audience before her, praising them for their voices, offering everyone in the room — the audience, her band — a collective sense of belonging and purpose. The natural chemistry between the individuals in that room made me forget about the drudgery I had been stuck on and instead consider the value of human connection that I once took for granted. Even through a screen, music can connect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWSF3Y"&gt;As I’ve watched the world revert to something resembling the normalcy of life before the year 2020, the Alicia Keys Tiny Desk concert has remained a consistent source of comfort that I’ve often turned to. It’s been the accompaniment to my happiest and saddest days, but each time, it has been exactly what I need: a gentle reminder that life is not everlasting but we will always have these humbling tidbits of humanity. This Tiny Desk concert is my treasured digital artifact. It’s my reminder that music is boundless, and that despite the ever-changing world we exist in, it is the universal constant — the one thing that helps us make sense of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aTvank"&gt;And if nothing else, Tiny Desk confirmed that “Fallin’” is a damn masterpiece. It’s not mosh-pit material, but I would still do anything to be a sardine in that crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: the half-finished Duolingo course</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-fPKAyJYBPlnzqM_AM5WsudFmQ=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632567/VRG_4679_Duolingo_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I am tormented by the specter of Duo the Owl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="3jw7V5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YG0jg0"&gt;I heard the notification whistle and reached for my phone instinctively. I was met with a bright screen and an ominous message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7BW7"&gt;“Hey Jamal, we’ve missed you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WI0zDo"&gt;Instead of coming from a friend or concerned neighbor, the message came from language-learning app Duolingo. Once again, I had abandoned a Spanish course, and Duo the Owl had popped up in my notifications to remind me just how frequently I failed to complete a course on the app. It became a kind of routine: leaving a course half-finished and then watching the anxiety pile up with each notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="8XFmTI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CrEb4W"&gt;I was drawn to Duolingo as a way to improve my Spanish, which had never quite clicked during college. The warp speed of university life often left me with little to no time on my hands, and languages had never been my strong suit. In my courses, I was forced to adapt to the timelines of a semester, and even when I did perform up to par, it felt like it was more about grades than actual knowledge. Duolingo seemed like a good way to break out of that trap and get comfortable with the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYDQwq"&gt;Part of my anxiety comes from the vulnerability I feel when testing out a new language. There’s always a period of confusion when starting something new, but I’m usually able to fake my way through it, pretending to have the skills for long enough to actually pick them up. Language isn’t like that. You can’t fake a transitive verb. When you don’t know something — when &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don’t know something — the error is inescapable. My friends were often available to help me out, but the threat of embarrassment made me too anxious to take them up on it. When I studied alone, I spent hours perfecting one word or syllable and having imaginary conversations that never bore witness because of my trepidation. The fear of failing stopped me from trying in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUOBU7"&gt;Without realizing it, I had turned Duolingo from a hobby into a place of hyper-evaluation. If it took me longer than a week to get comfortable with a grammar or vocabulary lesson, I started to see it as impossible. I had internalized the belief that learning was meant to come innately. If I wasn’t picking up Spanish immediately, I figured my brain just wasn’t built to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="paF8yx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can’t fake a transitive verb&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKcgHW"&gt;As it turns out, I’m not the only one who falls into this trap. Duolingo doesn’t release completion rates for its courses, but &lt;a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/us-language-report-2020/#uslearnersrank68thforhardestworkinglearnersbasedontheaveragenumberoflessonscompleted"&gt;a report last year&lt;/a&gt; said American users ranked 68th out of all countries in the number of lessons completed. A separate &lt;a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/39925566/Percentage-of-people-who-finished-a-course"&gt;informal study&lt;/a&gt; put the overall completion rate for Spanish at less than 0.01 percent. Far more people are getting stuck halfway through than are finishing lessons — so maybe my half-finished lessons weren’t quite as embarrassing as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDandG"&gt;Naturally, Duolingo thinks a lot about user retention. I spoke with Cindy Blanco, a senior language scientist at Duolingo, and she stressed that the courses aren’t intended to be one-size-fits-all. People come to Duolingo with different goals, and they may end up ditching the course once they’ve reached the level they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qd5Qom"&gt;“If you think, ‘Well, I want to go to Portugal and feel comfortable ordering in a restaurant,’ how much of the course do I need to work on so I could feel good about that experience?” she told me. “For other people it’s like, ‘Well, I really love K-pop and I want to understand the culture or read more about the bands in their own language.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXhSd7"&gt;That distinction extends to Duo the Owl, who had tormented me over my unfinished Spanish lessons. Blanco told me that the owl is designed to send different messages depending on culture and geography. In that sense, the app is focused on delivering a user experience that feels unique, even when it’s trying to rope a dormant user back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="J2QpRk"&gt;Since my conversation with Cindy, I’ve begun to dig back into my Spanish lessons. But I’ve also started to think about my unfinished courses in a different way. Learning isn’t always linear. It may take a while before I get comfortable with Spanish. In fact, it may never happen at all. Once I had let go of that insistence on perfection, I started to feel much better about dipping into the occasional Spanish lesson — and much less shaken when I see an unexpected notification from a cartoon owl.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: Wattpad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ERFfDnZgDBMX-EWANu9UO8qAto=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632615/VRG_4679_Wattpad_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking beyond my local library, I found a new way to think about writing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="KrmueU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="S1aWzP"&gt;I started reading early, and I spent my childhood hungry for stories. For the first half of my life, I was sustained by my small public library, finding solace in old, ratty copies of Lemony Snicket’s &lt;em&gt;A Series of Unfortunate Events &lt;/em&gt;and Louisa May Alcott’s &lt;em&gt;Little Women.&lt;/em&gt; It wasn’t until I was 14 that I felt the limits of my library’s bookshelves and started to look online for new, brave, curious protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPZswi"&gt;That’s when I stumbled onto Wattpad. When I found it in 2012, the site functioned as a microcosm of teen popular culture, reflecting the platform’s large contingent of Gen Z and millennial users. Every scroll, regardless of genre, brought users book covers largely adorned with Photoshop edits of notable teenage heartthrobs of the time (think: Dylan O’Brien in his &lt;em&gt;Teen Wolf &lt;/em&gt;fame, or a younger, long-haired One Direction Harry Styles). Some stories even included popular song recommendations (mostly Taylor Swift) and a cast filled with A-list celebrities, in the hopes of creating an immersive experience for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="WdCEDq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="St8FbU"&gt;Founded in 2006, Wattpad has grown far beyond the scale of my local library. The platform currently boasts 90 million users and 665 million stories, ranging from historical fiction to outright fanfiction. In its 15 years of existence, Wattpad stories have gained a reputation in the online literary community — a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;landfill of self-insert fanfiction to some, and a treasure trove of hidden gems to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvNN3"&gt;As a 14-year-old, I found Wattpad’s saturation of teen popular culture exhilarating; it promised to appease my quickly shifting reading preferences. My digital library became a hoard of historical fiction and supernatural romance novels, where I surrendered to my teenage angst and lived vicariously through questionably written characters. For four years, I religiously followed the satirical but romantic &lt;em&gt;Storm and Silence &lt;/em&gt;series, treating the Wednesday chapter uploads like morning church service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pL5FbF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A nexus where the personal and professional came together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zUS5QF"&gt;I was amazed by Wattpad, not only for its riveting content, but also for its ability to shatter many traditional barriers and expectations for writing. For one, authors seemed to balance their professional and personal personas on the platform, retaining sometimes thousands of readers under pen names like “dontstealmypoptarts” or “iheartonedirection.” Where I had previously only viewed authors as elusive and mysterious, these usernames instead suggested that anyone could write a book — even people who liked Pop-Tarts and One Direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYWusr"&gt;I also loved how authors often addressed their readership directly. They would spotlight a reader of the week, offer bonus chapters, and communicate any changes to their uploading schedule. Chapters contained author’s notes, a nexus where the personal and professional came together. Sometimes there was a note about upcoming exams, at other times a tragic comment about a pet’s passing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c79YkZ"&gt;Readers also bridged the divide, offering words of encouragement or criticism. They would share their excitement, amusement, or worry in a chapter’s comment section, and interact with other users in the comments. Readers and writers developed a collaborative relationship and a sense of community, as writers are able to refine their stories with this feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HNVGA"&gt;In 2014, I began to publish my own poems and books on the platform. My poems spoke about love and betrayals that I had not yet experienced. My books were enemies-to-lovers romance novels with bad dialogue that my 16-year-old self mistook for wit. A few of my books were ranked by the website’s popularity algorithm in broad categories, but most remained largely untouched by readers. Still, I kept writing for the joy of it. Eight years later, those pieces are like a time capsule of my teenage self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmxVvT"&gt;Wattpad has changed drastically since 2012. Book publishers have started to take notice, and the company has rolled out professionalizing features like content from established writers (“Tap Originals”) and pay-to-access works (“Paid Stories”). In January, Wattpad was acquired by a South Korean tech conglomerate, Naver Corporation, for $600 million. Like any online community, Wattpad writers are hostage to the profitability of their platform. The introduction of Wattpad coins, in particular, threatens to isolate or separate readers who aren’t able to buy them and access these new Paid Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hDV8pQ"&gt;As someone who joined the website for its expansive, accessible, and free content, I have mixed feelings about the new features and the emphasis on monetization. It’s a familiar turn for tech platforms, and while it’s alarming, it’s better than the site shutting down entirely. As a retired Wattpad user, I can’t help but feel nostalgic for all the time I’ve spent on the platform. I hope it can survive for all the 14-year-olds still looking for a bigger library, as a space where individuals can read, write, and form community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFCPab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTTC1O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Surface Duo 2 photos reveal new triple camera system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuSok3q4ktaYDZ0sCosN7-NpXyU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632335/surfaceduo2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Duo 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Tech Rat (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PQJOndIdGk" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHkkw1"&gt;Microsoft is readying a Surface Duo 2 for release later this year. Leaked images have revealed the dual-screen device will include a new triple camera system. The leaked images first appeared in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8PQJOndIdGk"&gt;YouTube video last month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/images-microsofts-upcoming-surface-duo-2-leak-revealing-triple-camera-setup?utm_source=wc_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=86625&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; they’re legitimate. Microsoft is expected to launch its Surface Duo 2 device in September or October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REaUu6"&gt;The camera system on the Surface Duo 2 appears to be the main significant hardware change on this device. It’s rumored to include a telephoto, ultrawide angle, and standard lens. The leaked photos show a bump at the rear of the device, just like many existing flagship Android phones. It also appears that Microsoft has moved its fingerprint reader into the power button on the Duo 2 and centered the USB-C port on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrWeUA1iyKNEZhoewoQVd7w4TSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740413/surfaceduo2leak.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 reportedly includes a triple camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XgE5JJ"&gt;The Surface Duo 2 is expected to have relatively minor design tweaks overall, with most of the significant changes appearing in the camera system and internal specs. Rumors suggest the Surface Duo 2 will include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G support, and an NFC chip for contactless payments. Microsoft may even slightly increase the size of each display on the Surface Duo 2, with slightly thinner bezels and options for both black and white color variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAkMuw"&gt;Microsoft appears to be sticking with separate screens on the Surface Duo 2, instead of opting for a truly foldable screen like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;. That means all eyes will be on how well Microsoft improves the software side of the Surface Duo 2. The original device has had a variety of software updates, but Android 11 still hasn’t appeared yet. That’s left the Surface Duo as a buggy device, with regular issues with multitasking and gestures, a screen turning off during book mode, and lockups using the fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new true wireless earbuds have a privacy-conscious ‘Whispering Mode’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1DEwcUWwGaCaBTSDDiQEaGJp0c=/0x0:1724x1149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631996/LG_TONE_Free_FP8_Pearl_White_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Tone Free FP8 wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6JXuLj"&gt;LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/07/new-additions-to-lg-tone-free-lineup-deliver-enhanced-performance-greater-convenience/"&gt;new Tone Free FP true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; feature a “Whispering Mode” where you can hold the right earbud next to your mouth during calls to use it as a dedicated microphone. It’s a neat privacy-conscious feature for those moments when you don’t want to have to speak loudly enough for the sound to be picked up by the earbuds in your ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myfucm"&gt;There are three new earbuds in the lineup — the FP5, FP8, and FP9 — and they share a lot of the same specs. All are noise cancelling, have three microphones per earbud, and have an IPX4 water resistance rating to withstand light splashes. Their earbud stems are 4.4mm shorter than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534509/lg-tone-free-fn7-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-anc-uv-case"&gt;LG’s previous models&lt;/a&gt;, and they have improved drivers and diaphragms which LG claims offers more bass without impacting clarity. Headphone Spatial Processing and 3D Sound Stage provides an audioexperience that surrounds the listener. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVuIde8Ec7JohOQeiUAaVoEjh5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740343/LG_TONE_Free_FP9_Pearl_White.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FP9 earbuds, whose case doubles as a wireless transmitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Wgd5F"&gt;However, there are individual features exclusive to one or two of the headphones. The most interesting of these is reserved for the FP9 earbuds, whose case can double as a wireless transmitter to allow the earbuds to be used with non-Bluetooth devices. Using a USB-C to aux cable, the case can be plugged into anything from a games console to an in-flight entertainment system, removing the need to use a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;separate Bluetooth adapter&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar to what we saw from Bowers and Wilkins’ PI7 earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395276/bowers-and-wilkins-pi7-pi5-true-wireless-earbuds-noise-cancelling-in-flight-entertainment-price"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp7g7W"&gt;The FP8 and FP9 earbuds feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/3/20896563/lg-tone-plus-free-true-wireless-earbuds-features-uv-light-bacteria-hygiene-google-assistant"&gt;LG’s bacteria-killing UV tech&lt;/a&gt;, which the company says can kill 99.9 percent of the bacteria on the earbuds’ speaker mesh in five minutes to reduce the chance of inner ear infections. These two earbuds also have improved battery life compared to the FP5, and can run for 10 hours on a charge, or up to 24 hours when used with their charging case (the FP5 is rated for 8 and 22 hours, respectively). Only the FP8 model supports wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZDqK2"&gt;LG’s new true wireless earbuds will be available starting this month in “key markets” at a price that’s yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZqBCn"&gt;Alexa routines can now be triggered using multiple custom phrases making it easier for everyone in a household to initiate smart home automations without having to remember the exact wording (&lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/alexa-routines-can-now-be-launched-with-multiple-phrases/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;AFTVnews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrNsB6"&gt;For example, instead of having to remember to say “Alexa, good night” to kick off a nighttime routine that locks the doors and shuts off the lights, you can now assign additional phrases like “Alexa, bedtime” or “Alexa, night night.” You can even add “Alexa, bonne nuit” to the same routine thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22088394/amazon-alexa-multilingual-support-italian-german-french-shopping-fire-tv"&gt;Amazon’s support for multilingual households&lt;/a&gt;. Up to seven custom phrases can be assigned to the same routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOF1yv"&gt;It’s a small but welcome change for smart homes built around Alexa. It follows a big week for Alexa, where we saw it get a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588961/alexa-voice-echo-male-female-celebrity-how-to-change"&gt;masculine voice option&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;huge developer push&lt;/a&gt; to drive Alexa’s expansion beyond the &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/07/more-than-50-features-to-build-ambient-experiences?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22350074%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD"&gt;more than 140,000 smart home devices&lt;/a&gt; that the ambient assistant currently controls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator is an impressive Xbox Series X workout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYqfS8nLCLl2gqlIIxuJzD98ZMI=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631857/apps.36297.13763447606987253.cdd9ae82_b2b3_40ef_a711_e5f137b50b22.ea3e204a_c28b_4506_b14b_4bcc8e03220f.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5xfcU"&gt;Nothing has pushed my PC further than &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. That might sound odd for a “game” that’s largely about flying around empty skies by yourself, but Asobo’s latest iteration of the classic franchise is technically groundbreaking and ambitious, with all manner of wizardry going on beyond the scenes to stream in accurate city data, real-time weather effects, and so on. I’ve still had a great time with it, but compared to most AAA games, &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; asks a lot more of your CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1id5Y"&gt;That’s why I was intrigued by the new version for Xbox Series consoles, which comes out on Game Pass tomorrow. In fact, it’s the first Microsoft game for Xbox Series consoles that won’t run natively on any Xbox One model at all, though an xCloud version is also coming to mobile and will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536418/microsoft-xbox-series-x-games-on-xbox-one-xcloud-streaming"&gt;eventually hit older Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt; as well. I’ve been playing a preview build provided by Microsoft on my Series X for a few days, and as with my PC, I think it’s the strongest workout for the hardware so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jx7kGw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Microsoft Flight Simulator returned to the skies","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21347809/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-preview-interview-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NKRTzB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is essentially the same proposition on Xbox as it is on PC, offering players the chance to pilot a variety of aircraft around a beautifully rendered version of our planet. The tutorials have been tweaked a little, with a series of shorter missions that should make it easier to get up to speed, and the various commands have been mapped to the Xbox controller in a straightforward, accessible way. You can make the flight model just as complex as the PC version if you want, although right now there aren’t a lot of Xbox-compatible flight stick options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vYttVG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator on the Xbox Series X looks absolutely stunning in 4K. It's a true graphical showcase for this next-gen console&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; full video: &lt;a href="https://t.co/e3MyKEuImC"&gt;https://t.co/e3MyKEuImC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;⬇️ preview &lt;a href="https://t.co/JR2MFK52Dm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JR2MFK52Dm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1419327063656439808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kHSc2I"&gt;On the Series X, &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; runs at 4K resolution and targets 30 frames per second. Overall, I got a more stable experience on the Series X than my own i5 6600K/GTX 1080 rig, which was impressive when I put it together five years ago but somewhat less so now. The frame rate isn’t perfectly smooth — you can drop below 30 when flying low in dense areas like downtown Manhattan, for example, and that’s noticeable. It helped that I played on an LG CX OLED TV, which is capable of variable refresh rates and means you don’t experience tearing or stuttering when the frame rate does fluctuate above or below 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoU6V1"&gt;Graphical settings are broadly comparable to what you’d get on a good gaming PC, if not quite at the top of the line. The game consistently looks stunning when you’re high in the air, and any seams in the experience are only really apparent when flying close to the ground. That tends to be more to do with how the photogrammetry streaming technology works — again, if you fly quickly into Manhattan or Shinjuku, not every skyscraper is always going to be loaded into memory at once, meaning some buildings might appear a little wobbly at first. I also noticed a few amusing glitches from time to time, like cars driving on the surface of the River Thames in London instead of on Tower Bridge directly above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtKFk9"&gt;As for the Series S, my colleague Tom Warren has spent some time testing that version, and the results are impressive for a tiny $299 box. The game runs at 1080p with reduced graphical effects and draw distances, but as you’ll see from the video, it delivers a solid Flight Simulator experience and will be by far the cheapest way to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7RzTPd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQju16fUY70?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CtBiVc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; has improved a lot since its launch last year, with “world updates” that expand the more detailed photogrammetry data further across the globe. That’s all there in the Xbox version, too, including the most recent Nordics update that includes hand-rendered airports and points of interest across Scandinavia, Iceland, and Finland. (It’s also worth noting that the PC version is getting a further update this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558803/microsoft-flight-simulator-pc-performance-improvements-patch"&gt;Microsoft promises should dramatically improve performance&lt;/a&gt; across the board — stay tuned for how that works in practice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qz2MPU"&gt;If anything, the Xbox version can feel a little too close to the PC version at times, with an occasionally clunky cursor-driven interface. It’s a little conspicuous to have a graphic settings menu where the only option is to turn HDR on and off, for example. But it’s better to leave too much in than to cut too much out: what matters is that the flying experience is as good as it could be given the hardware on hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWPsy2"&gt;From what I’ve played of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox Series X, I don’t feel like Asobo has left much on the table. It’s still an incredible technical achievement, and one well worth checking out when it hits Game Pass tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
