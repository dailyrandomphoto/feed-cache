    <title>Toyota’s autonomous division just bought the company that made a self-driving DeLorean do donuts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ss07tFJqDxMGaVmFLCvN7sZqKvQ=/6x0:1395x926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920041/1_WvaNRYj4C7k_diYdW2VOSQ.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I57IOo"&gt;Woven Planet Holdings, a subsidiary of Toyota, acquired Renovo Motors, a startup that makes operating systems for autonomous vehicles. It’s the latest acquisition that aims to accelerate Toyota’s mission to develop autonomous vehicles with connected software. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITonB5"&gt;Toyota established &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21052324/toyota-woven-city-japan-bjarke-ingels-ces-2020"&gt;Woven Planet&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021 to invest in and develop mobility with artificial intelligence. Since then, the company has been on a shopping spree, acquiring Carmera, a firm that provides real-time, high-definition maps and data for driverless vehicles, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;Lyft’s Level 5 autonomous vehicle division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wqmg1m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renovo converted a DeLorean with an electric powertrain and then did autonomous d&lt;s&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s&gt;onuts with it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NiPbtl"&gt;Renovo, which is based in Silicon Valley, makes operating systems that integrate all the software needed to run fleets of autonomous vehicles. Founded by Chris Heiser and Jason Stinson in 2010, Renovo has been involved in a number of interesting automotive projects over the years. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/9/7517291/renovo-coupe-electric-supercar-ces-2015"&gt;Renovo Coupe&lt;/a&gt;, a $529,000 electric supercar with 1,000 pound-feet of torque and a 0–60 time of 3.4 seconds, or its project to convert a DeLorean with an electric powertrain and then do &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2015/10/21/renovo-motors-and-stanford-built-an-electric-delorean-that-can-autonomously-do-donuts-video/"&gt;autonomous donuts with it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbUw1u"&gt;More recently, Renovo built an AV system that monitors not only driver attention but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17233614/renovo-affectiva-self-driving-car-driver-monitoring-emotion"&gt;passenger and pedestrian facial expressions for a better understanding of their emotions&lt;/a&gt; inside and outside the vehicle. The company worked with an AI startup called Affectiva to integrate this technology into its fleet of test vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ktVby"&gt;Renovo aspired to be the Amazon Web Services of self-driving cars. Its operating system, called AWare, enables autonomous vehicles to handle enormous amounts of sensor data. Renovo has also worked &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/12/samsung-renovo-self-driving-cars/"&gt;with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; to help test, develop, and deploy the smartphone giant’s self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUsfyO"&gt;“This is a really, really big day for us,” Heiser &lt;a href="https://medium.com/renovo-auto-blog/renovos-next-big-step-894ca2dbdade"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the acquisition by Toyota. “When Jason Stinson and I co-founded Renovo in 2010, we dreamed of a world where cars would be defined by their software platforms and, in doing so, unlock a world of new experiences and re-define the very nature of transportation. It is a vision that requires a complete re-think of the car to its core. This dream, in powerful alignment with Woven Planet’s vision and mission, now takes an even bigger step towards reality.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck took me to the top of the mountain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qv4QY4UNgDpUCjfbuE8ZJ3jsGTQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919698/mclark_210923_4776_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Car of the wild&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="J7Ofcc"&gt;Not everyone who buys Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck will drive it over basketball-sized rocks two miles above sea level. But that experience can be had on the North Fork Swan River trail in Breckenridge, Colorado, which is where the buzzy Amazon and Ford-backed startup gave &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and other media outlets one of the first chances to experience the R1T — a sleek, $67,500 luxury four-by-four for affluent-but-still-outdoorsy types that is finally shipping to customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;after multiple delays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1fdwX"&gt;For those casually keeping up with the boom in electric vehicles, the R1T may ring a bell: it’s the truck that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;announced to much fanfare at the 2018 LA Auto Show&lt;/a&gt; by Rivian, which had previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe"&gt;been operating in stealth mode&lt;/a&gt; since 2009. The company has since pounced on the excitement and anticipation for its “electric adventure vehicles” (which include the pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;and an SUV&lt;/a&gt;) and turned it into major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035192/rivian-funding-1-3-billion-t-rowe-price-amazon-ford"&gt;financial backing from Ford&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon, including a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs"&gt;create a fleet of delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; for the e-commerce giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0iYm0"&gt;Two days with the R1T isn’t enough to say if this incredible effort will succeed or fail, but a whirlwind adventure up into the mountains with the first EV pickup to market did give me the sense that Rivian is aiming for a very specific type of person, and that it has a very clear (and opinionated) picture of what this new type of electric vehicle should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpWlDC62bllOW8fJrT-q5u7XQmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883215/mclark_210923_4776_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rivian R1T in what may be its natural habitat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWNaFg"&gt;While the trail took up the majority of driving time, I’ll start with what it was like to drive the R1T on paved roads since that’s where most trucks are driven. I got to experience a wide range of conditions, from zooming up winding mountain passes to sitting in slow-moving construction traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HPjP6g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flooring the R1T’s accelerator is a lot of fun&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epw7TL"&gt;Rivian’s truck weighs around 6,000 pounds but is faster and more nimble than any car I’ve driven. The R1T has four motors — one for each wheel — that can easily pin your head to the headrest if you really floor it. It’s a lot of fun (even for someone like me who’s been accused of driving like a grandma), but it also serves a practical purpose; it’s a breeze to shoot up on-ramps or pass combustion-powered cars on the highway. That’s extra true in the Colorado mountains, where ICE cars can be starved for air due to the elevation. I’d press the Rivian’s pedal and just take off, all without the roar of an engine — or the 3-second delay I’m used to as my 2008 Subaru Outback puzzles over what gear it should be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/onjgA-EVXsqe8kwB0ayu7DkBIGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883203/mclark_210922_4776_0030.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The R1T’s cockpit, with its panoramic roof and dual-screen setup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tgXrPj"&gt;It’s also comfortable and simple, without being spartan like a Honda Element or old Jeep Wrangler. The R1T’s interior makes heavy use of an easy-to-clean (according to Rivian) vegan leather that feels like the real deal. The instrument cluster shows you all the most relevant information, like speed, drive mode, location, and range, but manages to not be distracting while you’re actually driving. Even the 16-inch center screen didn't get in the way of paying attention to the road, and the lack of physical controls left plenty of room for storage space, including a large mat where you can throw something like a camera or your keys and a gull-winged center console compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GoC9zz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The interior is simple, but in a luxurious way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNRN5V0sJ6_1XH_ifjbG7aMu0Hw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883221/mclark_210923_4776_0016.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Center consoles are usually not worth geeking out about, but this one was. The space in front of it also acts as a wireless charging pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0PUxYZ"&gt;It’s easy to imagine having a blast road-tripping in the R1T. The seats, including the back row, are comfortable, and you won’t have to worry about access to power for phones and computers. The truck is packed with USB-C and 12V ports and even has a few standard 120V outlets (Rivian hasn’t really said whether the truck will be able to power a whole house in an emergency situation, a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;Ford says the F-150 Lightning will have&lt;/a&gt;). Plus, there’s tons of dry and lockable storage, from the frunk and gear tunnel to a cubby underneath the rear seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSRRvg"&gt;Oh yes, the gear tunnel: it’s a compartment that spans the width of the truck, where you can throw your bags, skis, and paddles (or really anything else you can think of). It’s big enough for a human to squeeze into — an opportunity that I just couldn’t pass up. You can also access at least some of it from a hatch in the back seat of the R1T’s cab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wl3QjU_czsmWMquC3Lwb4kk8cUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883230/mclark_210926_4776_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plenty of room to crawl around in (but NOT to ride in).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/omP6WpjKsv1eOS9vXWuV8sMU7Wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883229/mclark_210923_4776_0037.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paint me like one of your frunk girls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rU4Yuj"&gt;The truck also comes with adaptive cruise control, which can make long drives and stop-and-go traffic more bearable, and a suite of driver assistance features called Driver Plus. On pre-mapped stretches of highway, the truck can take over steering duties, keeping you in the center of the lane and even attempting to follow curves. In my (very brief) testing, it handled fine going around curves, but a message did pop up on the screen warning me that I could have to take over at any time. It does, however, still require that you keep your hands on the wheel. If it has to warn you three times to pay attention, Driver Plus mode will turn off, and you won’t be able to turn it on again until you put the truck in park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYUL3d"&gt;The weight of the R1T’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/rivians-electric-r1t-pickup-truck-r1s-suv-get-their-official-epa-ranges/"&gt;135kWh battery pack&lt;/a&gt; is spread out along the entire length of the truck, helping it avoid some traditional truck problems. I didn’t experience any of the fishtails that I used to deal with when I owned a Chevy S10 or when I drove a mid-2000s Ford Ranger. That weight also keeps the Rivian planted when going into curves, without the body roll that sometimes comes with bigger cars. Despite the R1T’s quickness and high-tech features, it still drives like a truck. The high carriage means you ride pretty high up, and you have to be aware of the amount of space you’re taking up on the road. While the R1T is no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522959/cadillac-escalade-2021-first-drive-safety-oversized"&gt;Escalade&lt;/a&gt; or Tundra, it still towers over all but the largest sedans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVbd4J"&gt;Like it or not, the R1T will probably become the standard point of comparison when it comes to talking about electric trucks because it’s the first one to make its way into customers’ hands. That doesn’t mean that it won’t have to compete against trucks from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;, but it does mean that its concept of an EV truck being something for well-to-do outdoor enthusiasts is probably going to be one that sticks in the minds of consumers. If an electric truck comes out that can’t do 0-60 in close to three seconds, that’ll almost certainly get brought up in reviews because the R1T can do it. Up until this point, the experience and characteristics of an EV with a truck bed have mostly been theoretical, which made expectations more fluid. After driving the R1T, though, I can say it was exactly what I imagined an electric truck feeling like given what I know about EV cars and regular trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8jyD2j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The R1T is first, which likely means upcoming electric trucks will be compared to it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSk1It"&gt;Unfortunately, the one thing I have to keep imagining is the charging experience, as I never got to plug in the truck. Rivian’s excuse for this was that trips to a gas station wouldn’t be part of a press drive of a new gas car. I would (and did) argue that if you were driving a gas car for three days you probably &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; fill its tank at some point, but as far as I’m aware none of us got to experience charging the car outside of the handful of miles we gained from regenerative braking. Each night, Rivian whisked the trucks away to be cleaned and charged up for the next day’s adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-9Uau6bX-M13rMKQvfp9-j0rXyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883202/mclark_210922_4776_0029.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trucks beginning their nightly exodus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fXC48O"&gt;All I can speak to is what it’s like to open and close the door to the standard CCS1 charging port. Like the hood, gear tunnel doors, and tailgate, it can be opened either with a physical button, or using the touchscreen. (The hood and charge port door can be closed using the touchscreen as well.) Rivian also told me that if you start driving with the charge door open, it’ll close automatically. That feels like an incredible luxury to me. I always forget to close the charging door on my plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5fGjwruIwVWzZeTuhH0zMr_nTCU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883389/frunk_screen_access.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frunk, gear tunnel doors, and charging port can be opened and closed from the touchscreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWdFl6hnFek9sReLW5w_qEryNBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883356/Air_Sus_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rivian’s air suspension going from low to high, sped up four times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CqDdLc"&gt;Since Rivian charged the trucks for us overnight, I never had any range anxiety with the R1T, even while we were off-roading. Our test model was capable of going 314 miles on a full charge, but I don’t think I ever saw it dip below 90 miles, even after a full day of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq2jok"&gt;Beyond offering ample range, Rivian is accommodating adventurous drivers with five drive modes, which you can freely switch between: there’s All Purpose for paved and dirt road driving, Off-Road for when things get rocky, Sport if you’re looking for speed, and the aptly named Conserve and Towing modes. The Off-Road mode also has profiles like rock crawl, rally, and auto that change various things, like the ride height (which can go from 7.9 inches to 14.4 inches using the air suspension), braking behavior, suspension stiffness, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeSF9W"&gt;In 2019, Rivian announced that the truck would have &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzwM8KE2L3I"&gt;a “tank turn” feature&lt;/a&gt;, letting it basically do donuts while staying in one place. That feature &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/why-rivian-tank-turn-stationary-spin-feature-is-delayed/"&gt;has since been delayed&lt;/a&gt;, so I didn’t get to try it out (a shame, as it would’ve helped me avoid a four point turnaround).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4a9D9"&gt;I’m the type of person that Rivian seems to be targeting with it’s adventure-focused marketing; I spend almost every weekend hiking, biking, or kayaking when I can. So I was extremely excited when I was told that we’d be doing some “serious off-roading.” I did also wonder how serious it would really be — this was a press event after all, would Rivian really be throwing us at hardcore trails, potentially risking their trucks? (Not that losing a truck would be devastating to a company that’s raised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;$10 billion dollars in funding&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfeS0i"&gt;Apparently, yes. I don’t want to pretend like we were doing hardcore rock crawling, but we certainly got to see how the truck handled steep, loose climbs, water crossings, and situations where we were driving at an extreme angle over very uneven ground (though I don’t think we ever lifted more than one wheel off the ground). And the R1T handled all those things beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="VYWiH7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian calls the R1T an electric adventure vehicle — so how was it at adventuring?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5jRyX"&gt;Something that I thought a lot throughout the day was “this feels like it should require skill.” Instead of worrying about keeping the engine at the right RPM so I’d have enough torque to clear the next obstacle, I just pressed the accelerator and we went forward. There were many times that, had I been driving a gas truck, I likely would’ve had to back up to get a little momentum going, which I never had to do in the R1T. The Rivian was tall enough that it could drive over most of the rocks we encountered — and that was in its “high” ride height setting of 13.1 inches, not even the “max” setting of 14.4 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="yrwK2E"&gt;With that said, there were moments that I (a person who only occasionally off-roads) was nervous: some of the aforementioned intense angles left me gripping the &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oh%20shit%20handle"&gt;colloquially named “oh shit” handles&lt;/a&gt;, which backseat passengers also have access to, and did their job well. Also, I always hate it when the sky’s the only thing you can see out of the windshield. But the truck never felt like &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; was breaking a sweat, especially when going downhill — I just kept my foot off the pedal and let the regen braking keep me at around 4mph. It was much easier than the engine braking I’m used to, where you have to decide between going 10 in second gear, and 35 in third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbUlRs"&gt;One of the quietly impressive moments for me was near the beginning of the trail; it was relatively steep and, as I discovered, absolutely iced out. We stopped the truck to switch drivers, and when I got out to let the other journalist I was driving with take the wheel, I found out just how slippery the trail was in a hilarious fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkDFQ6f7Hfog4HlWSdYi_UvriFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883381/Fall_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usually when driving you worry about black ice, not mud-colored ice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z6myAt"&gt;I thought that, since we were starting from a dead stop on an intense grade, the R1T’s front wheels would at least slip on the ice a bit before it found its footing, much like I did (especially since a Rivian engineer told me that it sends more power to the front wheels than the rear in rock crawling mode). Instead, it just drove right over the slippery surface like it wasn’t there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtw6TU"&gt;Of course, the truck isn’t magic, and there is still some level of skill required if you’re going to be doing difficult trails. We managed to rip a hole in the sidewall of our tire, and had to do a very dusty spare swap. Thankfully, the truck is able to hold a full-size spare, tucked away in the bed (adding one is an $800 option for the 20-inch all-terrain tires we were using during the test drive), so we were able to get right back to driving pretty quickly. Apparently the rock we hit was problematic; the Rivian folks said they’d gotten flats there before with a previous group. There was also a reasonably technical climb where we had a spotter helping us out, because the front and side facing cameras the truck is equipped with could only do so much.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full-size spare and stablization-platform-equipped jack helped us get back on the trail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The R1T’s suite of cameras can help you see upcoming obstacles, and get a feel for where your sidewalls are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cscrZO"&gt;The R1T can handle unpaved terrain, but Rivian also says it wants the truck to look at home in the woods. I’m not really the right person to say whether it achieves that or not — in my opinion new and shiny things look out of place in nature (honestly, anything made by humans is stretching it). I think it fits in with nature far better than, say, the stainless-steel, trapezoidal Cybertruck, though the mountain goats we saw on the journey didn’t seem to love seeing six or seven Rivians in a row, as they quickly made themselves scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Km5un0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10777177"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agXBM5"&gt;Like Patagonia (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;a comparison Rivian’s CEO has made before&lt;/a&gt;), I can see the R1T’s design and driving experience appealing both to those who prefer the city and to people who are only slightly joking by &lt;a href="https://sectionhiker.com/what-is-hiker-trash/"&gt;calling themselves hiker trash&lt;/a&gt;. Though it’s certainly not going to be a vehicle designed for those looking to adventure on a budget given its starting price of $67,500. Even factoring in the &lt;a href="https://rivian.com/support/article/are-rivian-vehicles-eligible-for-the-federal-tax-credit"&gt;possible $7,500 federal EV tax credit&lt;/a&gt;, that’s an expensive vehicle for most people, especially those who are more interested in spending time outdoors than being traditionally employed. Higher-end gas trucks can reach similar prices, but you can get into them much cheaper: Ford recently announced it’s Maverick pickup truck, which is significantly less luxurious than the R1T, but also comes with a hybrid drivetrain and starts at around $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjHxSs"&gt;There are a few nitpicks I had with the R1T. The lack of CarPlay or Android Auto is a bummer, though it would be somewhat mitigated by the truck’s built-in navigation and Spotify app. The build-it-yourself approach has worked for Tesla, so Rivian could be fine if it really nails the UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Da99vg_8ezKUW5LV4izyD1Ul6A4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883385/AC_vents.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a lot of fun watching the vents move, but I wish I could just do it manually.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="APhsno"&gt;Some heating and cooling buttons would also be much appreciated though. As it stands, the climate controls live solely in software. The screen is also not laggy, per se, but it could be more responsive. It’s worth noting, though, that it was running pre-production software, and that Rivian can always make improvements with over-the-air updates. Rivian will have to hurry on those updates if they want them done before trucks start making their way to customers, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RJScaringe/status/1437842808384233477?s=20"&gt;production R1Ts are currently being built&lt;/a&gt;. A Rivian representative told me that the truck’s computer has “supercomputer” levels of power, which wasn’t evident through the UI (like it is with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;Tesla’s ability to play AAA games&lt;/a&gt;), though the Driver Plus system likely pushes the hardware harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVTAyB"&gt;I also found that the lack of a traditional step-up truck bumper made it a bit difficult to just jump up into the bed and grab something, though when I mentioned this to a Rivian employee they said that they’d been using the gear tunnel door for that purpose. While that definitely works, having to open the door and then close it again is a bit more of a pain than just grabbing onto the tailgate and hoisting yourself up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHt0KO"&gt;So, after going on what was basically the best test drive ever, who do I think the R1T is for? It seems like a good choice for those who like to go off-roading, as my experience shows that it’s capable of some pretty extreme stuff. That’ll also make it a good choice for campers, especially those who take less-traveled roads to get to wherever they’re staying. Rivian obviously has those folks in mind — the truck’s storage is good for those who like to bring &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98lM4S77_d4"&gt;a lot of luxury items with them to the outdoors&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has even teamed up with Yakima to create a rooftop tent for the R1T. Plus, with the R1T being a truck, it’ll be good for those who just want a bed for hauling oversized items, bikes, or things that would be a lot of work to clean out of a car like potting soil or Christmas trees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiLzWv0-GL2L_7FrbZNQpWpTbX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883412/Screen_Shot_2021_09_27_at_3.54.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rivian says the gooseneck hinge allows for the 4.5-foot long bed to be expanded to 83.6 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rl2aX9"&gt;As for those who constantly tow things, the R1T might be a mixed bag. While it’s rated for 11,000 pounds, Rivian says that actually pulling that much weight will cut your range in half. Even with the $10,000 max battery pack option, which Rivian predicts will get you “400 plus” miles, that’s not a ton of range. The truck may not be a great fit if you often carry long objects, like tandem kayaks or construction materials; with the tailgate closed, you’re only looking at a 4.5-foot bed, and even the clever tailgate extension mechanism only gets you 7 feet of floor space. And, again, there will probably be a lot of people that the R1T appeals to who simply can’t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nIY62"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I don’t think the bed is big enough for kayaks, and putting one on a rack defeats the purpose of having a truck.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fFfdz5"&gt;It may not be a great option for people yearning for the small trucks of yesteryear either, as many of my family and friends do. I got to talk to the Rivian’s CEO, RJ Scaringe, at a campfire-side dinner, and after getting our introductions out of the way I told him about my clan’s pleas for a single-cab, 6-foot bed truck. He basically told me that he heard me, but that the company is currently trying to make things that appeal to a lot of people. He told me the same thing when I asked about whether the truck could be towed flat behind something like an RV — the current model can’t, but it’d be possible to make one. It would just depend on whether there were enough people interested in that sort of thing to make it worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JO0AAG"&gt;Speaking of that dinner, all the meals we ate were cooked on the $5,000 camp stove that stows away in the gear tunnel, (which does mean you’re down one storage compartment). The camp stove is fancier than the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-2000020943NP-Classic-Propane-Stove/dp/B00005OU9D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;classic green Coleman stove&lt;/a&gt;: it gets electricity from sockets built into the sled that it rolls out on, and uses induction burners instead of gas. It also comes with a set of Snow Peak dishes, silverware, cookware, and coffee gear. While I didn’t get to cook on it, I can say that Rivian’s chefs were able to make some pretty great food using the system, though I’d chalk a lot of that up to their skill rather than equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DoVz1P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10777197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qTeyK"&gt;Despite that, Rivian may struggle to get traction with truck enthusiasts. It’s a market with a lot of brand loyalty (there’s a class of truck owners who are so proud of their chosen brand that they &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FORD-Well-least-circled-problem/dp/B00QJ8EYCW/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Funny+Car+Stickers+for+Ford&amp;amp;qid=1632531504&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy bumper stickers&lt;/a&gt; making fun of anyone unlucky enough to drive something else), and the R1T doesn’t have the sort of macho-rugged looks of some of the other mid-size trucks. Despite being around the same size, it didn’t look particularly aggressive or commanding next to a two-door Tacoma, and that’ll be even more true when comparing it against, say, a lifted F-250. While those types of trucks don’t appeal to me, they’re obviously popular: dual-cab, short-bed trucks &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g36005989/best-selling-cars-2021/"&gt;are some of the top-selling vehicles in America&lt;/a&gt;, and electrification doesn’t necessarily line up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/6/22217432/trump-supporters-petro-masculinity-capitol-building"&gt;the image those vehicles project&lt;/a&gt;. The R1T is compelling to drive, but that’ll only help if people are willing to give it a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ho66cj"&gt;Rivian doesn’t think this is an insurmountable problem. Some of the folks I talked to thought the company would be able to win over people who wouldn’t have necessarily considered a truck before, and were comfortable with not capturing the entire truck market (and thus not having to convert the &lt;em&gt;hardcore truck&lt;/em&gt; people). Plus, they think some of the creature comforts could be appealing: Rivian says that the truck is designed to fit in the average American garage, something that &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2018/09/17/big-trucks-suvs-bigger-garages/1285312002/"&gt;a lot of modern trucks can’t do&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, Rivian is going after the types of people who buy Subarus and Land Rovers, rather than &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwMBT1sOtGM"&gt;Power Wagons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eo62WN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian isn’t really expecting most owners to take it on the North Fork Swan Trail — but they could if they wanted&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cQrEvH"&gt;In fact, when I pressed Rivian about whether it expected really outdoorsy people to be drawn to its trucks, the company admitted that very few R1T owners were likely to take their trucks on the type of trails we went on — though it suspected that more Rivian owners would take it on bumpy, slightly rocky dirt roads that ended up at a campsite than, say, the type of person who &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj2e_kqiN-Y"&gt;bought an H2&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian also suspects that its customers will be a self-selecting group — the people who buy Rivian’s branding and ethos will be the type of people who want to spend a lot of time outdoors, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s2AQD"&gt;I actually saw this first hand — a park ranger from White River National Forest joined our off-road group, and by the end she said she was convinced and was at least considering buying an R1T. The event, which felt like a camp (or maybe &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamping"&gt;glamp&lt;/a&gt;) getaway more than a media event, convinced me that a lot of people at Rivian loved the outdoors like I do — most of the employees I talked to had at least one hobby that involved spending time in nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gEQTm9"&gt;Now those employees have to prove that there are more people like them that are willing to buy their vehicles. That might be easier if potential customers got to have the same experience I did; every part of it, from driving on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveland_Pass"&gt;mountain pathways&lt;/a&gt;, to chatting with Rivan’s CEO around a campfire, to crawling through the truck’s gear tunnel, was certainly an adventure. But, as with most adventures, it’s hard to imagine it being my everyday life — and that’s a little how I ended up feeling about the R1T itself. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s brilliant 65-inch C1 OLED is still $300 cheaper than usual</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="LG C1 OLED" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WY_z52hiqDlfEALaFr2hH9LjTl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919682/lgc1.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBaWnq"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new TV set, you’re in luck. The 65-inch version of LG’s C1 OLED is selling at an all-time low of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,797 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FLGOLED65C1PUB%2FLG-OLED65C1PUB-65-Inch-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-with-AI-ThinQ-2021-Model&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22696575%2Flg-c1-oled-hisense-u8g-tv-jabra-elite-85t-google-nest-hub-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also snag a $50 Visa gift card with your purchase. The same deal is available at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%2522-class---c1-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100761679.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; through October 10th, only your purchase comes with a three-year warranty through Allstate and a $100 streaming credit toward Google Play, Paramount Plus, Showtime, or Sling TV. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfF1fI37d73" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling this model for $1,799&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lC9VE"&gt;The lauded TV, released earlier this year, offers a slew of features gamers especially will enjoy, including support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync technologies, which help the TV resist screen tearing. It also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, low input lag, HDMI 2.1, and a Game Optimizer feature that makes it easy to access game-centric settings like latency. Of course, watching just about any kind of content will look great on an OLED, if you aren’t into gaming. Prefer a larger display? &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WGFKSMW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The 77-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG3243Z/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;83-inch models&lt;/a&gt; are also on sale at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GBhrxC"&gt;At $1,800, LG’s C1 OLED TV is still pricey. Thankfully, if the OLED is out of your budget, you can also pick up Hisense’s 55-inch U8G at an all-time low. Normally $1,000, the TV is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091YJQGVW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $850&lt;/a&gt;, which is $49 less than its previous low. Released in May, the TV offers a bright QLED panel touting a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR, with Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support, as well as four HDMI ports. Additionally, the 4K TV boasts support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, as well as Android TV, allowing you to quickly access Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and all of the popular streaming apps without a dedicated streaming device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22675894/hisense-100-day-no-regrets-guarantee-promotion-tv-8k-laser" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hisense is running a no-questions-asked promotion&lt;/a&gt; where you can return the TV within a 100-day window if you aren’t enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SPlYNr"&gt;A refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t — the updated version of one of our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; — are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeGetaoneyear1Passwordsubscriptionfor50percentoffAUG312021%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22696575%2Flg-c1-oled-hisense-u8g-tv-jabra-elite-85t-google-nest-hub-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $100&lt;/a&gt; through Jabra’s digital storefront on eBay. The Elite 85t were among the first pair of earbuds from Jabra to ship with active noise cancellation, along with the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously, a feature high-quality earbuds like Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds and Sony’s last-gen 1000XM3 lack.

&lt;p id="UJ5B8v"&gt;The second-gen Google Nest Hub, our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pick for the best smart display&lt;/a&gt; with a Google Assistant, is &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14360646?sid=VergeDailyDeals092721&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fnest-hub-gen-2-chalk-ga01331-us%2Fproduct_24483421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available at Staples for $80&lt;/a&gt; instead of $100 with promo code &lt;strong&gt;51688&lt;/strong&gt;. At around seven inches, it’s smaller than many other Google Assistant-enabled smart displays but offers many of the same features. It doesn’t have a camera, but the latest Nest Hub does come with new sensors to track your sleep and a display that automatically adjusts to your room’s lighting. The result, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review notes&lt;/a&gt;, is that photos look as if they’re printed on paper. What’s more, Google Photos automatically updates the display with new photos whenever you take them, making this a great digital photo frame.&lt;/p&gt;

Some games, like Sony first-party games, digital downloads, new releases, and preorders, are exempt from the deal.

    <title>GM’s BrightDrop starts building its first electric vans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlRdKbwxnGa5oi5rSed3q1vVThM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919562/BrightDrop_EV600_Production_Assembly.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: BrightDrop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="onls2R"&gt;BrightDrop, which is General Motors’ new dedicated electric delivery van spinoff, has revealed its second vehicle: a smaller van with many of the same capabilities of the larger version &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt;. The new mid-size electric van comes as BrightDrop is announcing that it has already built the first production versions of the larger van, and expects to have them on the road this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nop53C"&gt;The larger van, dubbed the EV600, has 600 cubic feet of cargo space, can travel up to 250 miles on a full battery, and has a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds. The new van has a little more than 400 cubic feet of cargo space, and is so named “EV410.” The smaller van will also share the same standard safety features (like front and rear park assist, automatic emergency braking, forward collision alert, pedestrian detection and braking) as the EV600, and will have other optional safety features (like rear cross traffic braking, blind zone steering assist, rear pedestrian alert, and more).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BD0zeQl1d3JsoW24y1LryowXfOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884229/BrightDrop_EV410_Profile.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BrightDrop’s new smaller EV410 electric van.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="esTP4p"&gt;BrightDrop says Verizon has lined up to be the first customer for the EV410, and will use the van in its field maintenance and service fleet. But the smaller van won’t go into production until 2023 at a Canadian assembly plant GM is currently converting. (BrightDrop is currently outsourcing assembly of the EV600, and plans to start building that van in Canada in November 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMp9qE"&gt;Both vehicles will be built on GM’s Ultium battery platform, which will power a whole lineup of new EVs, from the Hummer SUV and pickup truck to an electric Chevy Silverado, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCQkT0"&gt;BrightDrop is not the only company making an early run at electrifying the commercial market, but it’s one of the most well-positioned thanks to the support from GM. Many other early players in the space are startups. Some, like Arrival, have raised a lot of money in the public markets and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293615/arrival-uk-electric-bus-ev-photos"&gt;are making&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417970/arrival-uber-ride-hailing-ev-electric-vehicle"&gt;big promises&lt;/a&gt;. Others, like Workhorse, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688037/workhorse-suspends-delivery-recall-c-1000-electric-van"&gt;struggled to survive&lt;/a&gt; while trying to establish themselves before the big players showed up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trouble in the Club(house)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pDl0bXZ2JKU6e3RwtyUx7sdji54=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919581/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXZMcZ"&gt;Hello, hello. Welcome to week two of &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; under &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, although I should probably count this as the first official Tuesday &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;, given that last week was all mission statement and little fun. Today, I go deeper into a story I published this morning about Clubhouse’s sponsorship woes and look over some quick news. Let’s get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1fej5H"&gt;
&lt;p id="NziCS3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Where are the sponsors? Inside Clubhouse’s creator program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJ0xkB"&gt;This morning, I published a story about Clubhouse’s Creator First program, an initiative where Clubhouse offered creators a stipend to make 12 episodes of a live audio program. As part of the deal, the platform advertised that it would match these creators with sponsors so they could turn their idea into a “profitable creative endeavor.” Spoiler: that didn’t happen. I’d encourage you to read the full story, which I’m &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22460444"&gt;linking here&lt;/a&gt;, but for this newsletter, I figured I’d pull out a couple details that feel particularly pertinent to the podcasting world. Plus, some details I couldn’t include in the story because, although the internet is infinite, I don’t want you scrolling forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca5Lz9"&gt;The biggest thing I want to point out is how similarly Clubhouse feels to early podcasting in its current monetization efforts. There’s no real ad targeting, hosts are doing host-read ads or sponsored rooms featuring brand guests, and the best way to determine sponsors’ ROI comes in the form of promo codes or affiliate links on outside platforms. Plus, as I learned in reporting this piece, Clubhouse creators aren’t receiving detailed analytics on their shows, nor are they given any demographic information about their listeners. (For its part, Clubhouse says it doesn’t collect that demographic data, so even if it wanted to share them, it couldn’t.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j17kQC"&gt;In podcasting, Apple started providing analytics — a major move — &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/12/14/16778268/apple-podcast-find-listens-downloads-analytics-available"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Spotify burst into the market with not only better analytics and massive show deals, but also the intention of making it easier to advertise on podcasts, both through targeting and more data than ever about a show’s specific listeners. We’re starting to see that podcast ad vision play out. I wonder if Twitter, Facebook, Spotify, Amazon, or any of the other countless platforms attempting live audio might beat Clubhouse to the ad targeting punch. Succeeding in the space is about good content, true — which Spotify has attempted to conquer in podcast land — but also who can help people monetize the fastest. Nothing makes someone want to create more than the incentive of getting paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlGXmh"&gt;One other theme that continued to come up in my reporting was the lack of promotion done on Clubhouse’s end. To pull a popular podcasting refrain: Clubhouse has a discovery problem. To solve for this, it primarily relied on its own team members, who have lots of followers. (When they enter a room, it populates in all their followers’ hallways, or the app’s main landing page.) This might give creators a boost, but one creator program participant tells me even that promotional tool’s power appears to be waning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skOK1F"&gt;When Stephanie Simon, Clubhouse’s head of community and content, joined Cyndi Pham’s room one time, it jumped from 60 attendees to around 600. But later that summer, the boost dropped to only 300 listeners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4hi0d"&gt;“Even the value of their mainstays were diminished over a period of three months,” she says. “When Steph jumped on a room, it would be a 10x increase, and then it became a 3x increase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79SbSK"&gt;Cross-promo, yall. It’s what everyone from podcasting has mastered — except, in Clubhouse’s case, it needs to somehow cross-promote shows you can’t listen to off-platform since there’s not yet a recording function!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V5OlR"&gt;Okay, on to the next news bit. Speaking of Spotify ads…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9uzRr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify makes a bigger push for the sponsorship $$$&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9C6JbM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-kicks-off-campaign-to-win-more-advertisers-11632736800"&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that Spotify is making a concentrated effort to court more advertising revenue. Specifically, it’s renaming its ad business to Spotify Advertising (very creative), instead of Spotify for Brands, and is looking to “attract more podcast publishers and creators to its ad marketplace, after saying earlier this year that its advertising growth has been hindered by limited inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDXj5A"&gt;I don’t know how much branding can help Spotify recruit new advertisers and podcasters, but some arm-twisting could go a long way. The article briefly mentions Streaming Ad Insertion, Spotify’s proprietary ad technology that targets podcast ads against shows streamed on Spotify and is only available through Spotify’s own hosting platform, Megaphone. Basically, if you want access to all Spotify has to offer, you have to be on a Spotify-owned property. Convenient for Spotify! The real question is whether Spotify can get local businesses to advertise through audio, along with the typical direct-to-consumer brands we love and know. Well, I guess we’ll see if the branding change-up can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kKcfx9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rG8odl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another check-in on Apple Podcasts subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QGKno"&gt;My boss Nilay Patel hosts an interview podcast called &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoder-with-nilay-patel/id1011668648?i=1000496212371"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and in today’s episode, he spoke with John Carreyrou of Theranos reporting fame. Carreyrou hosts &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt;, a show from the Three Uncanny Four that takes listeners into the trial for Theranos CEO and co-founder Elizabeth Holmes. In his chat with Nilay, Carreyrou gives us the numbers we want to know for a show that’s destined to be a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHEwgY"&gt;“I think the narrative podcast, the one that’s free, is approaching 2 million downloads, and we’ve got about 6,000 subscribers to the bonus episodes,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHChHg"&gt;Those “bonus episodes” are only available through Apple Podcasts subscriptions for $3.99 per month. You could read this as a terrible return — only 6,000 people subscribed out of the perhaps hundreds of thousands of listeners, but it’s still $24,000 per month. (Granted, these are ad-free episodes, so that’s the only revenue they generate, annnnnd they require more production and labor, but!) Given that Apple Podcasts is only one app, and subscriptions are a new thing, both in the behavior sense and as an in-app feature, I’m impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UByC5r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAA buys ICM Partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBhg66"&gt;CAA is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-27/caa-to-buy-icm-partners-in-merger-of-hollywood-talent-agencies?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt; ICM Partners, meaning the talent agency world is getting smaller. Of course, the takeaway for us here is that, presumably, some blockbuster podcasting deals will come out of this merger. Caroline Edwards is ICM’s director of podcast initiatives and has brokered deals with Spoke Media, &lt;em&gt;Pantsuit Politics&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; Flyest Fables&lt;/em&gt;. CAA agents brokered the&lt;em&gt; SmartLess &lt;/em&gt;deal, among others, so I feel like this just helps CAA build an even stronger foothold in the podcast agency world. We love to see the deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syoNOu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What in the heck is happening at Ozy Media??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uX4zYS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; media columnist Ben Smith is always a must-read for me, but this week, he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/26/business/media/ozy-media-goldman-sachs.html"&gt;delivered a story&lt;/a&gt; about Ozy Media’s co-founder and chief operating officer impersonating a YouTube executive to impress Goldman Sachs investors. There’s a lot happening. Ozy operates six podcasts, apparently, and has raised money from iHeart Media. I’m mostly fishing here, but if Ozy is willing to play fast and loose with &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/these-publishers-bought-millions-of-website-visits-they"&gt;fake pageviews&lt;/a&gt; and impersonation, maybe there’s more going on here in the notorious land of squishy podcast download numbers. If you want to share anything about your Ozy podcast experience, please do reach out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PrfKIO"&gt;
&lt;p id="67g6XQ"&gt;Okay, that’s all for now! As always, you can reach me at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.carman@theverge.com"&gt;ashley.carman@theverge.com&lt;/a&gt; — or even &lt;a href="mailto:ashley@hotpodmedia.com"&gt;ashley@hotpodmedia.com&lt;/a&gt;! I’m also on Twitter at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman"&gt;@ashleyrcarman&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be back on Thursday with more news and reporting for you paid folks, and if you want to see what I’m cookin’ up over there, feel free to switch to the paid tier over &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. See ya!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos announce new Symfonisk lamp speaker, coming October 12th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sPQdPvZp55JhJfo8jcA_RPd4GPk=/0x17:2040x1377/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919565/PH181497.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1tZgjJ"&gt;Today, Sonos and Ikea officially announced the second-generation Symfonisk table lamp speaker. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; previously reported that the product was in the pipeline, and its design, which is now more customizable and comes in different styles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666940/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-lamp-speaker-leak-swappable-lampshades"&gt;leaked earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. The new Symfonisk lamp will be available in Ikea’s US stores, US website, and “select markets in Europe” starting October 12th. It’ll expand to all of Ikea’s markets in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k4Vp9"&gt;Ikea is changing up how it’s selling the new model; this time around, the lamp base (available in black or white) is sold separately from two different styles of lampshades. You can get an opaque glass shade that’s somewhat reminiscent of the original lamp speaker — though this one is open-ended on top — but there’s also a more translucent black glass shade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GLGbcU797wcrWyYN0E_Hx0_6Xr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883863/PH179130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s now a translucent black glass lampshade in addition to the opaque white style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zt70X"&gt;The textile lampshade looks quite different from the glass design, and like the base, it also comes in black or white. There’s also expanded compatibility with lightbulbs; Ikea says the second-gen lamp “supports a broader range of light bulbs thanks to the added E26 / E27 socket.” And the controls are now on the lamp itself, as the bottom plate of the original model is no more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DE6OT"&gt;The lamp base is priced at $140; the glass lampshade is $39, and the textile shade is $29. That puts both pieces together at either $179 or $189. The original Symfonisk lamp speaker initially cost $179 when it was released and later went up by $10, so you’re essentially paying the same for gen two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8qdiMb9sdeWBnfFHurKROivrjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883871/PH181496.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The textile lampshade has a much different look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IZ2irr"&gt;Ikea and Sonos say the new lamp features a completely redesigned acoustic architecture that, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;Symfonisk wall art speaker&lt;/a&gt; I reviewed in July, uses a custom waveguide to produce sound that can blanket a whole room with music. The first-gen product had a similar sound signature to a Sonos One, so I’m curious to see what these internal changes will do in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tST1E"&gt;Like all other products in the Symfonisk series, the new lamp speaker can be used alone, but it can also be added to your multiroom Sonos system. It supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, as well. The idea behind the lineup is to blend tech with a design that more naturally fits into home décor. But the lamp speaker definitely comes down to personal taste more than something like the nondescript &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;bookshelf speaker&lt;/a&gt;, which launched alongside the original Symfonisk lamp and remains available for $99. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Covering the blood testing startup in print and audio&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SfJhVv"&gt;If you’re a &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; listener, it’s a pretty sure bet that you’ve heard of Theranos and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;charismatic, troubled founder Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/a&gt;. Holmes convinced a long list of major investors and companies to give her huge amounts of money, all on the back of her claims that the Theranos technology could do hundreds of blood tests with just a tiny sample of blood — a pinprick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEUB4o"&gt;The Theranos testing machine — called the Edison — wasn’t accurate, even though it was deployed in Walgreens locations around the country. All the while, Holmes was appearing on covers of magazines, signing more deals, and attracting greater and greater fame. Until everything changed. Right now, Holmes is on trial in a criminal lawsuit brought by the federal government. Her former partner, Sunny Balwani, will face his own trial for similar charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogN78v"&gt;Today, I’m talking to the reporter who first exposed Holmes and Theranos, and started it all. John Carreyrou was working at &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; in 2015 when he started publishing articles about how Theranos was misleading customers, partners, and investors. Theranos aggressively tried to stop John’s reporting in 2015 and Holmes even tried to get &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; owner Rupert Murdoch, who was an investor in Theranos, to stop the story. He declined, and the stories have become a cautionary tale: you can’t just believe the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtkRnB"&gt;I wanted to talk to John about the case and what it has been like to cover the story for six years. He is as close to this story as any reporter can be. He’s even on the witness list — and he was put there by Elizabeth Holmes’ legal team. And because this is &lt;em&gt;Decode&lt;/em&gt;r, we talked about what it’s like to be a podcast creator — John is covering Holmes’ trial on a new podcast called &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bad-blood-the-final-chapter/id1575738174"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;how that business is going, and why he decided to put some of his episodes behind the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;Apple Podcasts subscription system&lt;/a&gt;. And I asked for the numbers, of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5to9R3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60QQUT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Carreyrou, you were an investigative reporter for the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You broke the Theranos story. You’re the author of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, a book about Theranos. And now you are the host of the podcast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which is coming out alongside &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the trial of Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the CEO and founder of Theranos. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keWM3e"&gt;Thanks for having me, happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NgvT3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m very excited to talk to you. I feel like, I followed your reporting, I read the book, listening to the podcast, all excellent work. And I think, a kind of a watershed moment in tech reporting and how the Valley perceives itself in relationship to the media. So I want to talk about all that, but let’s start with the very beginning. I think a lot of listeners to the show are familiar with the Theranos story, they’re familiar with what happened, but give us kind of the basics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; In 2015, you put out a story saying the Theranos fingerprick test just didn’t work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How did you come to that story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y42UD"&gt;I had not heard of Elizabeth Holmes until I read a profile of her in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; in mid-December 2014. At that point, she’d been raising her profile for about a year and a half in Silicon Valley and had become pretty well known. There had been the iconic cover story of her in &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; magazine, about six months prior. So she was becoming a celebrity, but this &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; story was the first time I’d ever heard of her. I read the story with interest, commuting back from the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s offices in midtown Manhattan to where I lived in Brooklyn. As interesting as I found it, I also was immediately suspicious because this whole conceit at the heart of the story was that she was a college dropout who was revolutionizing this very technical corner of medicine, namely blood diagnostics. That didn’t seem right to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pkQZQ"&gt;At that point I had been covering medicine for over 10 years, doing a lot of investigative reporting about health care and medicine, and I knew that science is hard and that it takes a long time. And it’s not like computer coding where people like Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates before him, learn how to code when they were in high school, in their parents’ basement. Medicine is not like that, you don’t teach yourself medicine in your parents’ basement. And so I was suspicious about that, but to be fair, when I got off the subway and I got home, I put the story out of my mind and kind of forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6ah99"&gt;And it was a few weeks later that I got a tip from a pathologist in the Midwest, who had read the very same &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; story. And he had been even more suspicious than me because he knew a lot about blood testing. He didn’t believe this idea that she had created this great invention that could do all these tests off a finger stick of blood. And he and I had had dealings before. So he called me up with a tip and I started digging from there. That was the inception of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfyBG7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things we talk about on this show is: there are products and then there are the enabling technologies that allow you to create the products. So the product for Theranos was this device called the Edison, which is what analyzed the extremely small amount of blood. The enabling technology was the ability to do the tests on a small amount of blood, right? That was the claim.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJa6BM"&gt;Actually, Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos had not been very transparent about what they were doing at all. It was very much a black box, physically and figuratively, but what came out of all these glowing interviews was that she had a device that could do hundreds of tests off a pinprick of blood. And if that was true, that was a real advance because up until that point, no one had figured out how to do more than a couple of blood tests off that small a volume of blood. There are two reasons for that; the first is that there are about four big categories of blood tests and once you do a couple tests from one category you quickly exhaust your sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWeT1D"&gt;And if you try to do a few more from another category of blood tests, which require completely different methods and techniques, you don’t have any sample left. No one had solved that problem. The second problem was that capillary blood, which is blood that comes from the finger, is not pure. It’s polluted by tissue and cells and those interfere with certain tests like the potassium test. And no one had figured out how to solve for that either. So, if what she was saying was true, it would’ve been a real medical advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Poqd9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are questions that you, as a reporter, as pathologists who are writing you tips, immediately leapt to. Obviously a huge part of the Theranos story, the reason they’re in court now, is that investors gave her a lot of money. Why do you think those investors weren’t asking the same questions, weren’t asking for evidence that these tests could work the way that she was claiming they could?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Owh3RA"&gt;Well, I think you have to rewind the tape back to 2015 which was really, the height of the unicorn boom. Facebook had made some people a ton of money, Twitter too. You had more and more of these private companies that were getting billion-dollar valuations. In fact, interestingly, Theranos, for a short period of a couple weeks, was the most valuable private startup in Silicon Valley — it was more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, or Spotify. I think investors wanted to join the next rocket ship to riches. And as a result, they kind of suspended disbelief and were less careful. This is before the backlash against tech, there was less skepticism back then. And to be fair, she was an incredibly compelling saleswoman. I mean, she had an amazing charisma. She is very smart. She’s a chameleon, a fantastic actress. And I think she charmed the socks off a lot of these investors and they really, really believed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s3HTRC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Theranos, for a short period of a couple weeks, was the most valuable private startup in Silicon Valley”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FhP7O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve always been stuck on that. I run a tech site and we were operating in 2014 and 15. I often think that we would’ve written the Theranos story that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Yorker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; wrote about the claims she made even though the product didn’t exist yet. She was a very compelling figure, but at the heart of it is kind of a very simple math problem: You’ve got a tiny amount of blood. Everything suggests that if you run these tests, you’re going to just run out of blood. How did you solve that problem? I’ve never seen any part of the Theranos marketing materials, or Holmes’s presentations, or interviews where that question was addressed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwDqEZ"&gt;Right. And I think the reason that the journalists who covered her in those initial two years and wrote the glowing profiles didn’t pick up on that is they didn’t come from a medical reporting background. They accepted the way she framed herself, which was as a tech entrepreneur, who was following in the footsteps of these other legendary tech entrepreneurs — Steve Jobs in particular, who she idolized and whom she dressed like. And reporters who were used to covering tech accepted that she was a tech entrepreneur, when in fact she was a medical entrepreneur. It didn’t take me long after the initial tip and then doing some digging to get the laboratory director of Theranos, who had just left the company, on the phone and granted him confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uxQXS"&gt;He started confiding in me a bunch of problems that he’d seen. It didn’t take me long after that to just reach out to the heads of pathology departments at universities to ask them about Holmes’s claims. And I found out that quietly, a lot of people in the pathology community had been extremely suspicious and skeptical because they didn’t think it was physically possible. So it wasn’t hard to find people to explain to me why this was probably not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8bsxS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That skepticism is a dynamic that we all live with now, there has been a giant backlash to tech companies, and we’ve all learned to be more skeptical of their claims and what they promise they will deliver. But the back-and-forth is: the skepticism is unwarranted, we’re doing things that are hard, we might fail, but we have to try risky things in order to have the big innovation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBn2Tx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That was basically Theranos’s defense against your story. And I realize that brought lawyers to you that wanted to sue the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, they went all out, but the core of the public defense was “We’re innovating, we’re taking risks, we’re going to fail. But if you believe in us, we’ll succeed.” How has that dynamic changed as we’ve entered the trial phase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSFyTf"&gt;I think this is where this story is so important. This is where the trial is so important. There’s this culture of faking it until you make it in Silicon Valley. And, I’ll be the first to grant you that a little bit of that is necessary to raise money. You need to hype and perhaps exaggerate a little bit to get people excited. You need to be, if you’re an entrepreneur, you need to be super optimistic. You need to get your employees excited. You need to get investors excited about your vision, but I think there’s a line not to cross. And I think Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos crossed that line when the hyping and the exaggerating turned into outright lying. And it turned into outright lying for years and years. And it was lying to the point that she went live with blood tests that she knew were flawed. And she knew she was conducting a giant experiment on patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BxCk0g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If she’s acquitted, then I think all bets are off.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wrTuCy"&gt;I think this trial’s going to be a referendum on whether entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley can keep getting away with that sort of behavior. If she’s convicted, I think it’ll be a wake-up call for the Valley that “No, that was taking things one step too far, and that if you do the same, then you’re looking at prison time.” If she’s acquitted, then I think all bets are off. I think you’ll have young entrepreneurs running around the Valley saying, “Yeah, I’m lying, I’m exaggerating, I’m pushing the envelope. But look at what Elizabeth Holmes got away with, and she didn’t spend a day in jail. So I think I’ll be okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uM6QCi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you think the line specifically was? Was it, famously, they had bought other testing devices from Siemens and other companies and tried to modify them? They had signed a deal with Walgreens — where do you think the line was specifically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOkQxD"&gt;The biggest line was going live, commercializing blood tests and having real patients use them, when you know that the tests are flawed and you know that your Edison machine is unreliable, that you’re only doing a handful of tests with that. And that, for the rest of the tests, you’ve hacked a third-party machine called the Siemens ADVIA 1800 and you’re diluting blood samples to make it work — because the Siemens ADVIA, being a regular commercial blood analyzer, requires a certain sample size. And you can’t meet that sample size unless you dilute the blood, and diluting the blood causes all sorts of problems because there’s already a dilution step in the Siemens ADVIA protocol. So then you’re double diluting and you’re increasing the chance for errors. And that’s exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdX33b"&gt;A lot of patients got erroneous blood tests. And we’re now hearing from some of these patients at trial, I think it was earlier this week or late last week, from a patient who got an erroneous pregnancy result. Theranos told her twice that she was no longer pregnant when in fact her pregnancy was perfectly viable and she carried it to term. So that’s the big, bright red line not to cross when you’re lying to the point that you’re putting people’s lives in jeopardy. And I think that applies to other industries that Silicon Valley has set its sights on. It’s not just health care. It’s also self-driving; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18627766/tesla-autopilot-fatal-crash-delray-florida-ntsb-model-3"&gt;there have been car accidents involving Teslas&lt;/a&gt;, where it looks like drivers have been lulled into thinking that they can let the car drive itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="tY4XXh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r2sZTW"&gt;When in fact, the software isn’t as reliable as [Elon] Musk would have you believe it is. And some of these accidents have been fatal. There’s also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17139518/uber-self-driving-car-fatal-crash-tempe-arizona"&gt;a woman who was run over by an Uber self-driving vehicle in Tempe, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, a couple years ago and she died. So, I think this has broader lessons for Silicon Valley, as it gets into these other areas, as it goes beyond just the bread-and-butter computer industry and sets its sights on artificial intelligence, health care, drones, driverless vehicles — there are lines not to cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaDuCJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bright red line between hyping your product for investors in that stage and commercializing dangerous products or unreliable products, I understand. The step for Theranos to get to commercialization was to sign deals with pharmacies, famously Walgreens. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General [James] Mattis was at the trial this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. He wanted to deploy the machines in the armed forces. That seems like, for me, a gating step where Walgreens should have seen if the machine worked, where Mattis should have had the machine tested more thoroughly. Why didn’t that happen here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWP3zx"&gt;I mean, for sure Walgreens should have done its due diligence more. It did hire, as I wrote in my book, a lab consultant named Kevin Hunter who worked for a period of time for Walgreens full-time, vetting Theranos. Early on, he smelled a rat and he tried to alert the superiors at Walgreens. Elizabeth and Sunny [Balwani] were able to freeze them out of meetings. After a few months, he was no longer included in the weekly Zoom calls they had and then the in-person meetings they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OyxECv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I heard from people who attended board meetings that [Henry] Kissinger and George Shultz would sometimes doze off during board meetings.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFPJM7"&gt;And so, Walgreens was ignoring its own consultant whom it had hired and was paying decent money to look after its own interests. That’s one of the most unbelievable parts of the story when you look back. Then the investors should have done more due diligence, for sure. The board members were asleep at the switch — in some cases, they were literally asleep. I heard from people who attended board meetings that [Henry] Kissinger and George Shultz would sometimes doze off during board meetings. So, there’s a lot of blame to lay around, a lot of due diligence that should have been done by various parties that wasn’t done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzAXNz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a chance they could have figured this out, if this thing had just kept rolling? There’s an element of your story, the first one in the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, that has always felt inevitable. The tests are producing inaccurate results. The results are not the same for all kinds of people. Eventually, doctors, pharmacists, Walgreens, people are going to figure this out and maybe shut this down. And so, it would have come out, because the thing wasn’t working. But is there a chance they could have pulled it off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUyMBW"&gt;I think the scandal would have exploded one way or another. I think I hastened it, but I think that within a year or two this would have come to light. There would have been more and more people getting tests from Theranos, more and more complaints and at some point, someone would have gone to another reporter or to a regulator. This house of cards would have come tumbling down. But I think Elizabeth’s bet was that she was eventually going to get there, she was going to get the last iteration of the device to work and that by then no one would be the wiser. The workaround with the hacked Siemens ADVIA, the malfunctioning Edison — no one would know about these things because she would have eventually gotten there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqid1N"&gt;I think she was deluded, because I don’t think she was ever going to get there. First, we talked about the technical limitations that to this day are still making this impossible — and believe me, there are a lot of people working on this problem, it’s not just Theranos trying to solve it. But then there’s also the culture of the company and the way she managed the company, the way she and Sunny Balwani managed the company. It was a completely dysfunctional place. There was a huge amount of turnover, Sunny was firing people all the time — it was a very toxic culture. And you don’t come up with great innovations, you don’t succeed as a company with that culture. I think this company was doomed no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hE4kcc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another constant thread of conversation in the Valley is that people are often harsher on female founders who are being demanding or tough. That to start a company and make things great and create a vision, you have to be really tough, you have to be extraordinarily demanding. I think maybe the scandal would have broken on its own because the test results weren’t accurate. What we would not have ever learned about was the culture of the company that was really explicated in your reporting, really came out in the book. Is it a case that she was just as demanding as everyone else, but her product was a fraud? Or is the case where she was that demanding to cover up the fraud?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VT9wo1"&gt;She’s an interesting character if you try to psychoanalyze her. I’ve often said in interviews I really don’t believe that she dropped out of Stanford at age 19 in 2003, intending to commit a long con, intending to commit fraud. No. She dropped out because she idolized Steve Jobs and other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, she wanted to follow in their footsteps, she had a vision, she pursued her vision, she hired people, and raised money, etc., did what entrepreneurs do. I think at a certain point, she did know that she was going too far. If you listen to my podcast, there’s an episode about this note she wrote to herself in 2014, as she’s being asked repeatedly by a prospective investor, Byron Trott, of BDT Capital, this big merchant bank in Chicago, for audited financials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gEqeeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Smart people picked off Mado, not you”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hZY0eK"&gt;She knows she doesn’t have audited financial statements to show him and this stresses her out. Late one night at like 4 in the morning, she writes a note to herself, and in the middle of the note are these lines, “Smart people picked off Mado, not you.” If you listened to this episode of my podcast, I think I make a compelling case that this was a reference to Bernie Madoff, and that she’s comparing herself to Bernie Madoff. To me, that indicates consciousness of guilt. That she wasn’t just, at that point, an idealistic, hard-driving entrepreneur who was shooting for the moon and putting a lot of pressure on her employees to make her vision happen. I think she also knew at that point that she was lying to investors. That the gap between what she’d promised them and what she’d told them she did achieve, and what the truth was, was a yawning gap, and that it couldn’t be reconciled. I think she knew that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqKNwG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/technology/theranos-elizabeth-holmes.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a story in the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; recently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; about other women founders in the hard sciences, biology, climate, etc., who are finding it harder to get funded because of the legacy of Elizabeth Holmes. How do you think this trial is going to affect that dynamic? Because I don’t think Elizabeth Holmes wanted that to happen, but it is a clear dynamic that is happening now. Investors in general have been burned. They are more skeptical, hopefully, as a result, but we are seeing in particular that skepticism pointed at other female founders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp6kzl"&gt;Well, if that’s happening, I think it’s really unfair. Why should women be singled out? This was just one bad apple. I think we’ve been used to frauds being carried out by men because the history of capitalism is dominated by men. And it’s only been recently that women are taking a bigger role in business and entrepreneurship and that’s going to continue. We’re going to see more and more women become founders and CEOs and successful entrepreneurs. And there’s bound to be bad apples among women too, just like there are among men, but that doesn’t mean that it should penalize women as a gender. It certainly hasn’t penalized men. So, that really doesn’t make sense to me, and I really don’t think it should be happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqHJjG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before this criminal trial that is occurring right now, there have been some civil lawsuits from investors. Give us the recap of those. It feels like investors are very reticent to sue. They obviously didn’t sue in this case. Do you think they provided any disincentive from this kind of lying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBaDkP"&gt;The first investor to sue was Partner Fund Management, which is a hedge fund based in San Francisco, which had invested $96.1 million in Theranos. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/theranos-reaches-settlement-with-investor-partner-fund-management/"&gt;They brought their suit pretty quickly and resolved it pretty quickly&lt;/a&gt;, reaching a settlement for $43.5 million with Theranos in the spring of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Geg6VS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did that money come from? I’ve always wondered this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dl1wWI"&gt;Well, when I came out with my first story in late 2015, Theranos still had something like $600 or $700 million in the bank, it had a ton of money left, and a lot of that money from that point on went to paying lawyers and went to paying for legal settlements. Another investor that brought suit was a former investment banker named Robert Coleman. His suit took longer to resolve. He eventually reached a settlement and was made whole. There was a lawsuit filed by Walgreens. Theranos also settled that one, I think for $30 million, but then ended up not paying the whole sum and was sued again. There were about a dozen suits filed by patients in Arizona that were consolidated into a class action. There were a lot of lawsuits. I think that they definitely helped the government investigation with all the discovery, and they very much called attention to what Theranos had done. I’m not sure that prosecutors would have brought the criminal case if it hadn’t been for all these other private actions, especially PFM’s lawsuit in Delaware. I think they got a ton of information from that lawsuit, and I think that lawsuit and PFM were instrumental in getting the criminal case off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDLT25"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That connection between the investors suing, the civil cases, the settlements, and the criminal case — why do you think the government wasn’t hot on the trail already? Why do you think it took that side of civil cases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogZHk2"&gt;Well, the SEC subpoenaed Theranos within a week of my first story in October 2015, so it didn’t take them very long to start an investigation. It took the DOJ a little bit longer. The first subpoena landed in, I think, early January of 2016, right after another big expose I’d written on the front page of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Then I think it took a while for those probes. This was a complex set of circumstances. It involves lab testing. It’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siILD1"&gt;This was also the San Francisco US attorney. This wasn’t the Southern District in Manhattan, which has huge resources and really smart and talented young prosecutors. They’re usually the ones that go after high-profile white-collar crime cases. This was the San Francisco US attorney’s office, which is much smaller, fewer resources, has had a mixed record. If you go back a decade and look at how they fared with option backdating investigations, they didn’t do very well. And so, this was a really high-profile case handled by a small office. I think they took their time to get it right, and eventually after three years of investigating, they did bring charges, they did bring criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="No7WcV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re a couple of weeks into the trial. The jury has been selected. There’ve been opening arguments. We’re starting to hear testimony from witnesses. Explain what this trial looks like. Elizabeth Holmes is having one trial. Her partner, in all senses of the word, Sunny Balwani, is having a different trial; they’re both being criminally prosecuted. What is Holmes on trial for? What is Sunny on trial for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4L53a"&gt;They’ve been charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Why wire fraud? Because it’s actually a very easy charge to prove. Basically, all you need to show to the jury is that Elizabeth and Sunny were lying when they solicited money from investors and got them to wire this money across state lines to Theranos’s bank account. The other aspect of these wire charges is actually a little bit more unusual. It involves the blood test results that were wired electronically across state lines from California to Arizona. That’s something you don’t see as often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXp1xM"&gt;So why is Elizabeth being tried now, and why is Sunny not there with her in the courtroom? Well, actually, that’s because, as we learned recently, part of her defense is going to involve blaming Sunny and alleging that he abused her, that he held her in his psychological grip, effectively depriving her of free will and agency. As a result, the judge had no choice but to sever their cases, and so Sunny is going to be tried early next year. This is going to be, I think, one of the pivotal aspects of the trial, and I think, by the way, she’s going to testify, because for the jury to believe this, I think they’re going to want to hear from more than just her psychologist. They’re going to want to hear from her. I think her defense team realizes that, and they’ve already pretty much telegraphed that she’s going to testify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7xY0p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes’ case could hinge on convincing the jury she was manipulated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vmeumV"&gt;This is going to be a really pivotal moment at the trial, because she’s a great actress. She’s shown in spades that she can get people to believe her, and I expect her to go on the stand and play the part of this naive young woman who was manipulated by this older man. The question is going to be, is the jury going to go for it? Is the jury going to believe it? Is the jury going to go for it to the extent of excusing everything else, basically, to the extent of discarding all that mountain of evidence that the prosecution will have presented it? I think the trial could very much ride on that. It’s going to be fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZJ2WF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve been to the courthouse already, you’ve seen the trial take shape, over the first few days. What’s the mood of the trial? Does it feel like the prosecution is already ahead because the story is so famous, or is Holmes and her team mounting an effective defense?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akdYpH"&gt;It’s interesting, the trial’s taking place in San Jose, which, not to offend anyone in Silicon Valley, is kind of a sleepy city. It’s not San Francisco. It’s certainly not New York. I’ve covered white-collar criminal trials in New York, and you have these century-old court buildings and these cavernous courtrooms. This is like this modern courthouse that was built in 1990. The courtroom is pretty small. It feels very cramped in there. The jurors are not very far from Elizabeth. They were like a couple of arms’ lengths away from her. Some of the jury spills out of the jury box because of the COVID protocols, because of the social distancing. As far as how it’s going, I was there for opening statements. I thought the prosecution did a decent job of explaining what happened. I thought the defense lawyer, Lance Wade, was very polished in his opening statement, in humanizing Holmes and in raising some of the lines of defense, such as the fact that she never sold a single share of stock, so how could this be a fraud if the main perpetrator of this fraud never profited? He also planted the seeds of what I call the Svengali defense, which is going to be blaming Sunny, saying that Sunny was the villain, but in recent weeks since opening statements, I think if I had to handicap it right now, I think the prosecution is ahead because the evidence is beginning to mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtAyOY"&gt;We’ve heard from whistleblowers, we heard from Erica Cheung, who’s actually a source of mine at the &lt;em&gt;Journal,&lt;/em&gt; who testified about how she tried to alert a lot of people to the unreliability of the blood test. We heard from another woman who was head of assay validation, who had worked there for eight years and who resigned right before they went live with the blood test because she had major misgivings about the reliability of the blood test and she told Elizabeth so in a one-on-one meeting. We’ve heard from General Mattis about how he initially thought that this had huge promise and gradually, he lost faith in Elizabeth and the company. And today on the stand, there’s the lab director. I think he’s going to be a really important witness. So I think that all the government’s evidence is really starting to amass and by the end of the trial, I think it’s going to be hard for the defense to account for all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1H0FkY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have obviously been as deep in the story as anyone can possibly be for years. There’s a mountain of evidence, of texts, of notes. You’ve mentioned emails, marketing presentations, financial statements, whatever you can think of. Some of it’s allowed and some of it isn’t. How is that breaking down?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqYCVi"&gt;Most of it is coming in, actually. At one point a couple months ago, the defense had objected to the text messages coming in, saying that the government hadn’t proved that they were authentic. So the government went back and found the PricewaterhouseCoopers forensic security expert who’d actually taken Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani’s phones and basically made tapes of them. He was a witness who was called to the stand this week and the prosecutors had him read the texts to the jurors, and I’m told by my colleague, Emily Saul, who’s in the courtroom, that they were riveted by these texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmWyeS"&gt;So the texts are in. The defense also tried to repeatedly get the testimony from patients and from doctors excluded, to no avail. The only thing the judge agreed to do was to limit the patients’ testimony to the facts, to, basically, the blood test results that they got from Theranos and the subsequent blood tests they got from elsewhere that showed that the Theranos results were false. The patients are not able to testify about the emotional turmoil they experienced from their inaccurate tests. But other than that, the judge is letting a lot of what the prosecution wants to come in in, and that’s a real problem for the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="345W57"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That limitation on the patients is so funny to me because it assumes the jury has no human empathy. If you hear a woman say, “This test told me my pregnancy was going to miscarry and that was a lie,” you don’t really need her to finish the thought with “and that made me feel bad.” Is there any reason why they fought over that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjWpQW"&gt;Because the defense is deathly afraid that these patient sob stories are going to prejudice the jury against Elizabeth Holmes. They want to keep that testimony from each of those patients very short and they then want to counter it by saying that these are just a handful of patients and that Theranos conducted more than 8 million blood test results and that the government is only presenting 20 or so patients with erroneous results. Of course, the government will be able to rebut that by pointing to the fact that Theranos had to void nearly a million blood test results after the federal inspectors went in and found all the problems at the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLNdLJ"&gt;But, you’re right. I think the jurors are not dumb; they can read between the lines. One of the patients that is going to testify had a false HIV result from Theranos telling her she had AIDS when in fact, she didn’t. All it’s going to take for jurors to put themselves in her shoes, and to be appalled, is going to be just to hear that she got a false HIV result. They don’t need to hear her say how she spent weeks agonizing over this before she could afford to get retested. They’ll know that’s outrageous and I think that’s a real problem for the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QW8xDp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you anticipate being called as a witness? You’re a central character in this tale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCzitV"&gt;I actually do, but ironically, I don’t expect to be called by the prosecution because I’m not on their witness list. I am, however, on the defense’s witness list. I’m No. 6 on the defense’s witness list and so I’m expecting a subpoena any day, and I’m expecting the defense to call me during their case in chief, and if that happens, I think that one of the lines of defense will be that Carreyrou was this rabid reporter who had it in for Elizabeth Holmes. That this was a witch hunt, that he contacted regulatory agencies and biased them, that they went in and inspected and came down more harshly on Theranos than they might otherwise have because of my intervention and because of my reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuS1y6"&gt;I think there’s only so far you can go with this line of defense because ultimately, when the regulators went in, they found what they found. I had nothing to do with what they found on the ground in that facility in Newark, California, and at Theranos’s headquarters in Palo Alto. So I’m skeptical that it’s going to work. And then if you’re the defense and you call me to the stand, then you open the door for the prosecution to ask me questions and to elicit from me testimony about what I went through when I tried to expose the scandal. The scorched earth campaign that Theranos conducted to try to quash my story: the way they hired private investigators to follow my sources; the way David Boies and Heather King, the Theranos general counsel, sent threatening letters to me and to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; threatening to sue us; the way Sunny flew out to Phoenix to intimidate doctors who’d spoken to me on the record to try to get them to recant; the way Elizabeth privately lobbied Rupert Murdoch — who owns the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; and who was a big Theranos investor — to kill my story. I think the defense will open the door to all of that being talked about if they call me to the stand. So I think it’s risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPUoDO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s always been interesting to me that Rupert Murdoch, in the context of this story, comes off as having a very high set of ideals about journalism, because he was an investor in Theranos, but he did not do anything at the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as far as I’ve heard or has otherwise been reported.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymj7er"&gt;That’s right. He had invested $125 million in Theranos. I actually didn’t know this when I was reporting my story. I only found out about it a year after my first Theranos story was published. And it’s true, he did not intervene. So this is not to absolve him completely, but certainly in the case of Theranos, he behaved really well as a steward of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQ0s5L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to talk about Sunny. His name has come up several times because Holmes is going to make this Svengali defense. He’s being tried separately. Who is Sunny? What is he like, and do you buy this Svengali defense?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIG8xp"&gt;Sunny is a Pakistani guy who came to the US in the ’80s during college and stayed and made a career in Silicon Valley. He worked for 10 years at Lotus and Microsoft, and then he joined an e-commerce startup in the late ’90s, at the top of the dot-com bubble, and he and his partner sold it for a lot of money and he cashed out. A couple years later he met Elizabeth Holmes when they were both part of a Stanford Mandarin program. They met in Beijing on this program and then they kept in touch, and when she dropped out of Stanford a year and a half later in late 2003, she got back in touch with him and he gave her advice. He became sort of a mentor. Eventually, that morphed into a romantic relationship. In 2009, about five years into the life of Theranos, Theranos was running out of money. Sunny stepped in and guaranteed a bank loan with his personal wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y4wk06"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This was her company. Was Sunny influential? Sure. Did he help her run it? Sure. But was he the puppeteer and was she the puppet? No, I don’t buy that.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wk3rPl"&gt;And at that point he joined the company and from 2009 onwards, he helped run the company and they really ran the company as a partnership. He was the COO and president while she was CEO. I don’t buy their line of defense that he was her Svengali, that he manipulated her, that she was under his psychological grip. The texts don’t back it up. The dozens and dozens of employees I interviewed for the book and for the podcast who worked with them say that this was a partnership of equals. If anyone had the last say, it was Elizabeth, and that she was firmly in control of the company. Let’s not forget, she had 99.7 percent of the voting rights. She was the founder and CEO. This was her company. Was Sunny influential? Sure. Did he help her run it? Sure. But was he the puppeteer and was she the puppet? No, I don’t buy that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49rBhf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They were romantically involved as well, yeah?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghRyex"&gt;They were romantically involved. They lived together in a big house Sunny owned in Atherton. So yeah, it was a partnership at work and it was a partnership at home. They were sleeping together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FccHFw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And he’s much older than her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8DfdO"&gt;He’s 19 years older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38IF53"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this is particularly dicey territory in the context of this trial, right? He is an older man, she’s a younger woman. There is an enormous amount of contextual strife about women founders, women executives, in tech in particular. Her defense cuts against the entire grain of women in leadership positions. She’s saying, “I was controlled by this older man.” Do you think that works here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7687m"&gt;It completely contradicts her demeanor, and by the way, prosecutors are going to play videos of her at the height of her fame when she was speaking to audiences and looking incredibly confident and self-possessed. The jury’s going to see those videos and I think it’s going to be extremely hard to reconcile this new image she’s trying to put forth with what they’ll see on their video screen. The other really dicey thing about this is that she’s basically accusing a brown man of sexually and psychologically abusing her, and he’s not there to defend himself. Who knows how that plays with the jury? It’s really sensitive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="df0ufj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that has occurred to us as we were preparing for this interview is that she is going to blame Sunny and say that it was all his fault and he was the puppet master, and she might get acquitted. And then Sunny’s going to have a trial and say, “I was under her spell. She was this radiant, compelling figure,” and then he’s going to get acquitted. And then no one is responsible. Is that a possibility here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1q8ZVB"&gt;It’s certainly a possibility. You never know with a jury trial. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I still think the odds are that Elizabeth gets convicted. And I think in some ways the case is even stronger against Sunny because he directly oversaw the lab and he was the one who interacted directly with some of the whistleblowers, and so she’s a little bit more insulated than he is. I think he’s going to have a tougher time rebutting all the government’s evidence. So I think what would be more realistic is that she gets acquitted and he gets convicted, rather than both of them get acquitted. But when I look at all that government evidence, I still think that both of them get convicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQrqUa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here is a question I’ve been dying to ask you this entire time. You started reporting the story in 2015. You have experienced every up and down, from high-powered lawyers marching into the offices of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to yell at your employers and try to shut this down, to the first story breaking, which must have been an emotional high, to the book coming out, to now there’s investigations and lawsuits. There’s a trial. Now you’re doing a podcast about it. Are you tired of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3NRR8"&gt;Part of me is tired of this story. It’s consumed the past six and a half years of my life and I am eager for it to be over. I want this trial to be over. I want to have closure. I want to see justice done. At the same time, I feel like I opened this can of worms, I started this, I felt like I owed it to myself to cover the story until the end. I felt like I owed it not just to myself, but to everyone who’s been following the story. I owed it to them to cover it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZjZe8"&gt;Since I’d left the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, I felt like the best medium to do that was a podcast. And so hence the podcast and hence the name of the podcast, &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt;. This is the final chapter of the story that I was not able to write when I wrote the book because its events hadn’t happened, and I’m writing it now, or rather I’m narrating it now, in the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjH7dr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;have you learned that has changed your opinion of the events of the book or has reinforced those things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sS8W3x"&gt;There’s nothing that’s materially changed the arc of the story that I told in the book. I have gotten my hands on a lot more documents and emails and texts, a lot of them are SEC case exhibits that I got my hands on. They only make it worse. They only make it clear to me that there was indeed fraud here and that she was indeed lying to investors. For instance, I’d heard a small investor who invested in Theranos — and actually, he was a character in the book — had told me that he heard from the head of the VC firm he invested in, Don Lucas, that Elizabeth was saying that the Theranos machines were being used by the military in the field. So I knew that from talking to him when I was writing the book, but I didn’t know she was saying this to virtually everyone. She was saying it to the CEO of Safeway, Steve Burd. She was saying this to the CFO of Walgreens, and Sunny was saying it too. There is government evidence now that shows that, at one point, they were walking around Theranos headquarters and Sunny points out one of the Edison devices to Wade Miquelon, the Walgreens CFO, and tells him, “That’s the model that’s on the Apache helicopters in Afghanistan.” She was telling this to investors, to Betsy DeVos’s people, to a hospital chain called Dignity Health. When I was writing the book, I didn’t quite know the extent of the lying. And it’s now become more apparent to me with all the evidence that’s come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8eOdmt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have an interesting podcast strategy here. There’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which is a free podcast that everyone can go listen to. It’s great, you should listen to it. Then you have “This Week In Court,” which is a paid product. How’d you make that decision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dq9gD"&gt;Early on, we decided that we wanted to do a narrative podcast with high production values. And we wanted not to just regurgitate the book, but to really add new elements, break news. And at the same time, we knew that people would want to know what happened during the trial. And so the system we came up with is a free podcast, that should be composed, by the end, of 12 episodes, that are scripted and that are narrative-based. And then bonus episodes that come out every Monday that are called “This Week In Court,” that recap what went on in court that week. That way you get the best of both worlds. And so far it’s been really successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0e2xt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any numbers to share with us? Are lots of people buying the paid podcast?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEuHoS"&gt;I don’t know if I’m supposed to say this, but I think the narrative podcast, the one that’s free, is approaching 2 million downloads and we’ve got about 6,000 subscribers to the bonus episodes, who are paying $3.99 a month for that premium content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiWTdE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s tough being on the other side of a reporter’s questions, isn’t it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIar54"&gt;It is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBhaLG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, the reason I ask is because we talk to a lot of creators on the show. We’ve talked to a lot of media people. Adam McKay is making a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence based on your book, and you are one of the writers of this movie. What you have here is an extraordinarily valuable piece of intellectual property that just happens to be now becoming a true crime story. And I’m wondering if you are thinking about it that way, or if you are a journalist who, because the story is so sensational, is being thrust into a world of entertainment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYBHhw"&gt;Yeah. You make a great point. This story has just fascinated people for five, six years now. It just seems to never stop fascinating people, and it also doesn’t seem to stop. I mean, the wheels of justice turn very slowly in this case, and it’s only now that the trial is happening. So that has sort of expanded the lifespan of the story. It’s been really strange. It’s good in many ways, but &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt; is sort of like a franchise at this point. But yeah, part of me is kind of hoping that it ends soon so that I can move on to something else finally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8tNzc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that in your plan? One of the questions I’ve always had for people in this situation is: you have been very successful with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. The book was successful. One anticipates the Jennifer Lawrence movie will be successful. The podcast seems like it’s successful. Are you done? Do you have a next project in your head after this? Or are you just moving to a place without blood testing at all and you’re just going to wrap it up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoeeR8"&gt;After the podcast I’m done. I’m not doing any more Theranos-related projects. I’ll consult on the movie and I have high hopes for it. So I’ll be watching that closely. But after that, I’m done. I want to do something else. I don’t want to be pigeonholed as the Theranos reporter for my entire career. I’d like to do other things, and that may be, you know, writing another book, probably involves doing more journalism, but yeah, after this podcast I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj0X6B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you were an investigative reporter at the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which I think is fair to characterize as one of the most traditional newsrooms in media, with literally one of the most traditional distribution channels, a print newspaper, and a paywalled digital product. When this is all over and you think about doing journalism again, are you going to go back to the traditional newsroom? Have you learned something about where journalism should go now? How does that look to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8w6Q3"&gt;I don’t know what the future is made of at this point. I do feel like I am a journalist at heart. And I’d like to perhaps write another book. If I do another book, it’ll be a nonfiction book. It’ll be a journalistic book. If I do another podcast, it’ll be nonfiction, it will be journalism. So I feel like whatever it is that comes next will be an extension of my journalism career. It may not be as traditional as working for an online newspaper, but I think that training has served me well. And I think reporting is what I’m good at, so I intend on continuing to report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4rXx2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any projects in the back of your mind that you’re thinking, “Oh, that’s the next one?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmQeeJ"&gt;I’ve got some ideas there. They’re not well-formed yet. And I think it would be premature to get into any of them, but I’ll talk about it when I’m ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6jx0P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re not trying to tip off your targets. I know what you’re doing. You’re being cagey. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZT2Nb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next in the Holmes trial, in the Holmes story? People are watching this, our deputy editor, Liz Lopatto, is at that trial — she’s going to be there for months, it seems like. You’re doing this podcast while we wait to see the conclusion. Then Sunny Balwani is going to be on trial. But for people who are kind of casually watching this, what are the moments to look out for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BFQu1"&gt;This week, today, and potentially going into next week, the lab director testimony, I think he’s going to be a crucial government witness. I think it’s also going to be interesting to see how the defense tries to impeach him. I think one of the many lines of defense is going to be that he was the guy that Elizabeth trusted to make sure things in the lab were under control. And so to the extent that they weren’t, then it’s his fault. It’s not her fault. Another important moment, I think, is going to be when Brian Grossman takes the stand. He is the portfolio manager at Partner Fund, the San Francisco hedge fund that sued Theranos. He took notes during his meetings with Elizabeth and Sunny. And he actually did do a fair amount of due diligence. And I expect his testimony to potentially be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYMtvP"&gt;He’s a smart guy. I think he’s articulate. And I think he’s going to spell out to the jury exactly the ways in which Elizabeth lied. I’ll be interested to see if Rupert Murdoch is a witness. I’ll be fascinated to see whether David Boies gets called to the stand, whether Heather King, his former law firm partner, who for a year there was Theranos’s general counsel who I did battle with, whether she’s going to go on the stand, and what they all have to say. And then of course, the big moment is going to be if and when Elizabeth testifies. I think that is going to make for amazing theater. Speaking of Hollywood, that’s going to be a Hollywood moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmvQb6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. Well, John Carreyrou, it has been an absolute pleasure to talk to you. Thank you so much for coming on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zx408Q"&gt;Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPad Mini 2021 review: a little different</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The middle child of the iOS lineup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="61X6W8"&gt;The complete redesign of the $499 2021 iPad Mini has a lot of people taking a second look at it — myself included. The allure of a smaller iPad appeals to more than just the pilots and doctors Apple cites as popular users. It appeals to me. The iPad Mini occupies a middle space between the phone and full-size iPads, which turns out to be exactly what I’m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62espm"&gt;It’s tempting to think of the iPad Mini as just a smaller iPad, or as just a bigger iPhone. It is both of those things and yet neither. It’s the middle child of Apple’s iOS lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32h5Fw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10776922"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3p-vKHrb6XdcJ31r3kexPmlDOXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883440/vpavic_210924_4766_0022_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini works with the second-generation Apple Pencil, which charges by sticking to the side of the iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QyjtPg"&gt;The iPad Mini has been redesigned to match the look and feel of the iPad Pros and iPad Air. That means it has flat sides and more squared-off edges, but more importantly it means that the screen is larger, going closer to the edge and filling out the device at 8.3-inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91C4SL"&gt;Apple also updated the processor to the top-of-the-line A15 Bionic — though I suspect the main reason for that is so that it won’t need to give it a spec bump for a few years. 5G also comes along for the ride, but not the ultra-fast mmWave flavor (no big loss there, given how rare mmWave really is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drPaPn"&gt;But the star of the show is the bigger screen. It’s surrounded by smaller, even bezels all around the front of the device. I do wish they were a little smaller, but I think doing that would significantly add to the cost of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz33yw"&gt;Given that the base model is already 500 bucks for a mere 64GB of storage, I prefer the tradeoff Apple made. The only other storage option is 256GB, which runs $649 (5G versions cost more still).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8UBYc"&gt;The screen also isn’t quite up to the quality you’ll get on the iPad Pro models. It’s high-enough resolution, but when scrolling in portrait mode I can see just a little bit of a jelly effect, where one side moves ever-so-slightly faster than the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMpRAr"&gt;It’s a common thing on a lot of screens, you can test it on your own screen at &lt;a href="https://www.testufo.com/scanskew"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s usually not noticeable because it often happens vertically instead of horizontally. When I use the iPad Mini in landscape, I can’t see it. I don’t think it’s a big problem, but it’s there. I’ve asked Apple for comment and will update if there’s a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPEZiD"&gt;If I had an actual gripe about the screen, it would be that it doesn’t get bright enough to comfortably use outdoors in bright sunlight. But the truth is I don’t have any real complaints — I love having the slightly bigger screen than prior Minis and it looks nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNxPMBfksjIU9H1070teRLjzCx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882360/vpavic_210924_4766_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad Mini has a single rear camera, like the iPad Air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FZfgJh"&gt;The rest of the redesign is what you’d expect. It supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, which can attach and charge magnetically to the side of the Mini. Apple had to move the volume buttons over to a different spot to accommodate that. It also improved the cameras — the front facing one now supports the Center Stage feature which tracks you and keeps your face centered during video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxTQFR"&gt;Battery life is okay but not amazing. Unless I’m using a big iPad as my all-day work computer, it seems like it can last a week between charging. The Mini doesn’t isn’t that good. It’s pushing it to get a full day of constant use, but lighter use does get me through a couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVHrr3p0267UGeehmUinTHtJdgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882366/vpavic_210924_4766_0061.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple ditched the home button this generation, so the Touch ID sensor is located in the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8smglyVlw43AQk9JSP9yqCmy5G0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882364/vpavic_210924_4766_0043.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The squared off sides bring the Mini in line with the iPad Pro and iPad Air’s designs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2SFNR"&gt;You unlock the iPad mini by resting your finger on the Touch ID sensor on the power button, just like the iPad Air. The speakers are nice and loud. It uses USB-C like a modern device should and therefore is compatible with a wider array of accessories than iOS devices that use the Lightning port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHRnEK"&gt;It also lacks a headphone jack, which is unsurprising but I think worth bringing up here because it could keep some people from buying this device to hand off to a kid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpETYF"&gt;Speaking of things that everybody just seems to have accepted but is actually a genuine problem that deserves continued pressure: support for multiple users. Apple continues to refuse to allow iPads to support multiple user accounts (outside of specific education settings, anyway). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xX0Ww2"&gt;I still find it punitive — not every family can afford (or wants) to buy an iPad for every person in the household and sharing a device can be a real hassle. Tablets that run Android, Amazon Fire OS, Windows, and even Chrome OS support multiple user profiles. The fact that the otherwise best line of tablets out there does not is flat out ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYDatO"&gt;The other iPadOS concern with the iPad Mini is that Apple doesn’t seem to have fully thought through what it means for it to be running on a smaller display. There are places where some buttons or text are cut off. In landscape mode, the keyboard is almost comically large and hides too much of what you’re trying to look at. And all too often buttons and icons end up being so tiny that — as &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/jobs-7-tablets-should-come-with-sandpaper-so-users-can-file-down-their-fingers"&gt;Steve Jobs once joked&lt;/a&gt; — you sometimes feel like you need to sand your fingers down to tap them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_eGxB260KXMqNs9WmLxtaqUsWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882365/vpavic_210924_4766_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad Mini can be comfortably held for a long time — like when you’re reading a book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yAQeU5"&gt;That was a lot of complaints. But despite all of them I dearly love the iPad Mini and have gone so far as to replace my iPad Pro with one. If anybody asked me if they should do the same I would be loathe to say yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNuqc2"&gt;Instead, I would respond with another question: do you know exactly why you want to have a smaller iPad instead of a big phone or a full-size iPad? Because the iPad Mini is not very good at the things those are good at, and it’s only really better than those things in a few specific ways. I just happen to care a lot about one of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvnPq5"&gt;There are specific niche use cases for an iPad Mini. If you do computing work in the field and need something more portable, the iPad Mini makes a ton of sense — maybe more so now that it works with USB-C accessories. Apple’s marketing around pilots using it isn’t fluff, either — it’s a genuinely useful and much used device in small aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7Wl43"&gt;But the iPad Mini is worse than larger iPads for a lot of the things people want to use iPads for. The screen is smaller for videos and too cramped for multitasking when you’re doing a lot of work. It’s more expensive than the base $329 iPad (also recently refreshed with better specs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5fe7j"&gt;It doesn’t have a smart connector for keyboards, which means you’re on your own to find a Bluetooth keyboard that you like. (As an aside: why are all portable Bluetooth keyboards so terrible? Somebody please make something better than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fkeys-to-go.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22696652%2Fipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XMM1XJV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FFVVDJ8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ugh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7O4guI"&gt;For me, what the iPad Mini is best at is as an evening device, the thing I putter around the house with instead of my phone. I don’t just mean that it’s a “content consumption” device, either — though of course that’s a big part of it. I can do some work on this thing, but it’s constraining enough that I do less of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdM6iTHJ17tEVxmHM1RmYf16iIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882359/vpavic_210924_4766_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Apple iPad Mini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B5UNyg"&gt;I like the iPad Mini because it can do all the multitasking tricks a big iPad can do, but most of the time I end up using it like a giant phone. I like it better than a giant phone because the screen is even bigger still than that device. (Though why Apple doesn’t add some sort of split-screen to the iPhone Pro Max phones is beyond me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXgk0m"&gt;Most of all, I like the iPad Mini because its physical size changes my relationship with the content I’m engaging with on the screen and — most importantly — with what’s happening around me. I physically can hold it further away from my eyes, which as a human body in the real world opens me up more than a phone does. I’m not hunched over in a one-on-one with a screen nor am I fully immersed in something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TQE6Z"&gt;It’s in between, and as such it means I’m simply more approachable to the people around me to talk, to look up, to stand up and wander over to the kitchen. Like the Galaxy Z Fold, it’s a device that requires more intentionality to use than a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="fRgBWB"&gt;The iPad Mini is not just a small iPad. Even though the change in screen size doesn’t change how the software works (to its detriment), it does change how you use the software. That’s why it’s great for me — and it’s why my advice to anybody considering one is to think about whether or not it would truly be great for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boPWF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VyIiC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dolby Vision gaming launches first on Xbox Series X and S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uosqD5UN_0qOXq3dtn21a65r73M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919475/dolbyvisionxboxseriesx.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dolby Vision is now available on Microsoft’s latest Xbox consoles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cNsoaQ"&gt;Microsoft is bringing Dolby Vision gaming support to its Xbox Series X / S consoles today. The feature has been in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435864/microsoft-dolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-test"&gt;testing since May&lt;/a&gt; and will be available in more than 100 HDR games in the future. While Xbox has supported the HDR10 standard for years, Dolby Vision gaming is appearing first on Xbox consoles and offers support for dynamic metadata. Microsoft says this should result in “brighter highlights, sharper contrast, and more vibrant colors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omvwIl"&gt;“There are more than 100 next-gen HDR titles optimized for Series X / S that will feature Dolby Vision, and in the future you’ll see more games like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; taking full advantage of Dolby Vision,” explains Katie Slattery, an Xbox program manager at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrAyou"&gt;Around 10 games will support Dolby Vision at launch today, according to a list on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fpromotions%2Fdolby-vision-atmos-enhanced&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F28%2F22697993%2Fdolby-vision-xbox-series-x-s-feature-available-now" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Xbox website&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft promises more than 100 will be optimized soon. &lt;em&gt;F1 2021&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Immortals Fenyx Rising&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;DIRT 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, all include Dolby Vision support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtUKvF"&gt;Microsoft has also been working with Dolby to bring some benefits of Dolby Vision to existing HDR10 and Auto HDR games. Microsoft is bringing “new visual enhancement capabilities that utilize Dolby Vision technology to deliver an improved visual experience for thousands of existing HDR10 and Auto HDR games,” says Slattery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EePB8eJdHE9p7-Gocpx8Ny27nSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884192/dolbyvisionxboxseriesx.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox consoles are the first to support Dolby Vision for gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2cHWp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers can choose to enable Dolby Vision in game engines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyWtH4"&gt;Developers can choose between integrating Dolby Vision into their game engine or taking advantage of the built-in Dolby Vision technology within the Xbox developer platform. Games that use Auto HDR aren’t true Dolby Vision games, but Microsoft says they’ll benefit from the Dolby Vision mapping technology on Xbox to display more accurate images on Dolby Vision TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk9vQu"&gt;You’ll need a compatible Dolby Vision TV to take advantage of this new feature on the Xbox Series X / S consoles, and Microsoft is also recommending enabling automatic low-latency mode (ALLM). Dolby Vision is compatible with ALLM, Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and 120Hz games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwBSoM"&gt;You can check in Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; TV &amp;amp; display options &amp;gt; 4K TV details to see whether your TV will support Dolby Vision. If it does, you can enable Dolby Vision gaming support in Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; TV &amp;amp; display options &amp;gt; Video Modes &amp;gt; Dolby Vision for Gaming. You may need the latest TV firmware update to enable Dolby Vision or 120Hz modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeHoGs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction September 28th, 10:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft shared a statement under embargo on the number of Dolby Vision titles supported on Xbox that was incorrect. We have corrected this information, and detailed which games are supported. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse needs creators, but creators need cash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gzBeY8U8ZTBhvPDWcWmaT3s1ZIs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69919477/Image_from_iOS__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Tarik Mask&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hosts looked to Clubhouse for sponsors — it rarely delivered&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YQfkvN"&gt;Dozens of Clubhouse creators had been anticipating their first sponsorship meeting for months. As the inaugural class of Clubhouse’s &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/creator-first-accelerator/"&gt;“Creator First” program&lt;/a&gt;, they were supposed to receive Clubhouse’s help landing sponsorships and turning their shows into a “profitable creative endeavor.” The creators wrote down lists of brands they wanted to speak with and prepared one-sheets pitching their live audio shows. But when the time came, it turned out they weren’t getting one-on-one meetings with the brands; instead, they would be pitching their shows to a public room on Clubhouse, alongside dozens of other creators, where anyone on the app could join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8pARO"&gt;“It was a real big joke,” says Cyndi Pham, a creator from the program and a media consultant herself. “I feel like [making it public] was something they did to save face because they couldn’t get any sponsors to show up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuBSF2"&gt;The creators each had two minutes or so to pitch their programs to the sponsors in the crowd. “Dozens of agencies and brands attended,” according to a Clubhouse spokesperson. But technical difficulties tripped up multiple creators, preventing them from speaking. Clubhouse told the creators they’d hear more after the event and that interest was pouring in. But the contacts never surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29OKHC"&gt;“I received no email, so either that means nobody was interested in my show, nobody came, or I haven’t gotten the information,” says one creator who asked to remain anonymous because of their ongoing relationship with the Clubhouse team. “And I suspected the second one: that nobody came.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MeVJWO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The program culminated in a public showcase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bS2H56"&gt;Six creators from Clubhouse’s creator program say no brands sponsored them before the end of the program, and Clubhouse failed to turn any of their shows into sustainable endeavors, as it advertised it would. None of them plan to keep doing their high-production shows, and many are refocusing their efforts on other platforms, simply because they have a better shot at being compensated for their effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbVpGo"&gt;The creator program’s troubles suggest bigger potential issues for Clubhouse, which is reportedly valued at $4 billion. If Clubhouse can’t entice brands to put their cash behind its hand-selected, premium content, how will it keep creators on the platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKeeXT"&gt;“[Clubhouse has] a whole cohort of creators who mastered this craft, and now they’ve got to figure out how to make it a living,” says Owen Muir, a psychiatrist who hosted a mental health-focused show with his wife Carlene MacMillan for the program. “And Clubhouse is going to help us do it, or someone else will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNwzoh"&gt;It’s unclear how much money Clubhouse is making right now, despite its unicorn status. It has partnerships with some major organizations — like TED and the NFL — but the details of those deals aren’t public. And critically, Clubhouse isn’t directly monetizing the typical live audio rooms its users host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8usrNn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Six Clubhouse creators say they received no sponsorships through Clubhouse’s team&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xm0ni"&gt;Creators themselves also have no way to regularly monetize their shows like they do on other platforms. Right now, Clubhouse only offers tipping as a way for hosts to make money off their rooms, and the creators I spoke with say they rarely, if ever, received a tip. There’s no automatic insertion of ads, and sponsors seemingly don’t understand how the platform works even if they might be interested. One creator says they had to spend a significant amount of time educating potential guests and others about how the app functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmYEJP"&gt;Clubhouse said “a number” of the &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/creator-first-inaugural-class/"&gt;25 Creator First shows&lt;/a&gt; landed sponsorships and gave three examples in a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But of the three names Clubhouse provided, only one might have come through Clubhouse’s team itself. The others either resulted from the creator’s established relationships or through another Clubhouse creator who is unaffiliated with the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4gdgc"&gt;Even when sponsors did show interest, Clubhouse’s tools made it hard to support them. Pham, who arguably had one of the most successful shows from a monetization standpoint, had issues validating sponsorships, given that Clubhouse barely provided analytics. She says she and the other participants received the number of unique listeners, the total number of minutes spent listening, and the number of listeners a room had at its maximum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDxZhj"&gt;“Obviously, if you know anything about sponsorships, that means nothing to anybody,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0eKhB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Crvchz"&gt;The creators point out they received no demographic information about their listeners, something brands need and want to see. In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Clubhouse says it doesn’t collect demographic data. There are also no in-app links within rooms or a way to designate that a room is sponsored, apart from saying so in the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNZ0UM"&gt;“I think when [Clubhouse] first came out, it was so buzzy that there were brands willing to sign on because of the buzz,” MacMillan says. “It was a very cool place to be. I think now that it is a little bit more mainstream, they need more than that to sign on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqSUJ0"&gt;Clubhouse gave creators a $15,000 stipend to cover the length of the program, although that was on a per-show basis, meaning co-hosts split the cash. Creators were also given new equipment, like iPhones, if needed; a producer to assist them; a creative agency partner to make visual assets; and the Clubhouse team’s direct line for advice or to vent. Everyone who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were proud of the shows they made, despite likely not being able to continue them because they need to focus on supporting themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgqpJG"&gt;Some of Clubhouse’s other advertised perks never surfaced. The team said it would help them book high-profile guests, for instance, but Clubhouse only named three connections made when reached for comment. Creators were also told they’d receive promotion both within and outside the app — another thing that barely occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDxIU8"&gt;“We had to beg for tweets [about our shows],” says another participant who asked to remain anonymous because they fear retaliation from the Clubhouse team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uAklvb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clubhouse’s analytics pale in comparison to other platforms’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJjCrY"&gt;The company’s biggest promotional tool was the Clubhouse staff itself, these creators say. If a staff member entered a room, that meant more people would see it in their hallway, or the app’s main landing page. Stephanie Simon, Clubhouse’s head of community and content, for example, has over 3 million followers, so when she joins a room, all of them should see it prominently on the app’s homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qdbyo"&gt;“They will use their staff to drive traffic,” MacMillan says. “That seemed to be the major mechanism, which is helpful, but you have to rely on that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9AU2p"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Clubhouse spokesperson said: “At Clubhouse we move quickly, build in public, talk with the community, and ship improvements each week based on what they tell us. We think that’s a more human approach, more transparent, and if we are going to make social audio better, we need to be committed to listening about what works and what needs work. The inaugural Creator First program has proven invaluable for feedback and will help us refine this program and design better features for the entire Clubhouse community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5NBNe"&gt;The creators I spoke with say they plan to continue using Clubhouse in some capacity — they all love the community on the app — but they’re sketching out a new strategy: how they can keep making content and get paid for doing it, which likely means less time or effort going into Clubhouse. For many, making their Creator First show took hours every week, whether it was prepping in the form of reading up on guests, scoring episodes with music, planning detailed run-of-shows, or emailing people trying to find someone to guest. Now that the stipend is over, they have to use that time to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZL2fz"&gt;Roderick Martin, for example, hosted a show about UFOs for the Creator First program. He’s found some success from YouTube — a TV show crew discovered him there and made him a host of a new program on Discovery Plus — and he also hosts a podcast. He says that if he now had a high-profile guest secured, particularly a guest that wants to be compensated for their time, he wouldn’t bring them to Clubhouse. He’d just lose money. Plus, the live Clubhouse show exists for only that period; there’s not yet a native recording function or archive that he could monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIUEFj"&gt;“I would have to make that ultimate decision and do a video-type podcast to where it can be placed on YouTube so that the monetization of YouTube over time — because this is going to live forever — can begin to make that asset generate revenue,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYJ2Gf"&gt;Another creator says they’re also weighing what to do with their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCQT25"&gt;“We’re better off turning this into a podcast, instead of doing it on Clubhouse, that then we could distribute, market, get sponsors‚ and it’s evergreen — it doesn’t disappear, people can find it — that might be a better use of our time,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otx5Xx"&gt;Meanwhile, nearly every social app has dedicated millions of dollars to bringing creators to their platform. Facebook announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;spend $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next year and a half to do so; Snapchat was giving away $1 million per day for months; and YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606291/youtube-shorts-fund-launches-100-million"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; a $100 million fund to encourage people to use its TikTok competitor. Even LinkedIn is &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/"&gt;dedicating millions&lt;/a&gt; to creators with the goal to specifically try out live social audio. Traditional podcasting apps are also offering subscription products that will help creators stay in touch with their listeners — Spotify and Patreon both give podcasters their listeners’ emails, something Clubhouse users don’t receive. Clubhouse isn’t giving up, either. It’s announced plans to continue the Creator First program in both India and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XYk0eJ"&gt;Clubhouse and its competitors are pulling from the same playbook. But the key difference between YouTube and Clubhouse is that its platform already generates revenue for lots of people. If Clubhouse wants more creators to join and make high-quality content, it’ll need to get sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
