    <title>New trailers: Godzilla vs. Kong, The World to Come, Son of the South and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W62kYel6R61X_nd204Edo9Z4_ZI=/362x0:1496x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713716/godzilla_vs_kong.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong | Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZArnBR"&gt;I finally finished &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; last night and I get why everyone loved it so much. I was totally prepared to not like the earnest, goofy Ted but Jason Sudeikis won me over. I won’t spoil in case you haven’t seen it, but &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;has plenty of plot developments you expect will turn out a certain way —because we’ve been conditioned to have plots drawn out as long as possible and with as much unnecessary drama as possible— but then the characters behave like actual people! They’re smart and funny and nuanced and I can’t wait to see them again in Season 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBuqKw"&gt;But look what just dropped this morning: The &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; trailer! Let’s gooooo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5hT3Vx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odM92ap8_c0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XooTBu"&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3ld3U3"&gt;The trailer for the long-awaited flick about the showdown between Kong and Godzilla— whose release was pushed back a year due to the coronavirus pandemic— is &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; here and it looks very awesome, with lots of roaring, punching, and stuff exploding. What more could we ask for? Alexander Skarsgard, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, and Brian Tyree Henry star in &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, which hits theaters and HBO Max on March 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="owqnIs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XdBp0KktXpk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5qt3QJ"&gt;Dear Comrades!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sEVuGx"&gt;Sorry if I gave you whiplash switching genres here! This movie tells the story of the 1962 Novocherkaask massacre, where Soviet troops fired on a crowd of unarmed protesters striking over working conditions and food prices (the incident was referenced in Solzhenitsyn’s &lt;em&gt;The Gulag Archipelago) Dear Comrades! &lt;/em&gt;is told through the eyes of Lyuda (played by Julia Vysotskaya), a former Communist party stalwart whose daughter goes missing after the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L3xU3a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEpSdb_f1pE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6dGD7a"&gt;Boogie &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="j488zd"&gt;This film tells the story of a Chinese-American basketball player with aspirations of playing in the NBA, whose parents want him to follow the more traditional path to college. Written and directed by Eddie Huang, &lt;em&gt;Boogie&lt;/em&gt; stars Taylor Takahashi, Taylour Paige, Pamelyn Chee, Mike Moh, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Alexa Mareka, Perry Yung, and Pop Smoke. It hits theaters March 5th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="swBQbX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x0IjvDWw0i4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qX5Ux9"&gt;Son of the South &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HK3lzt"&gt;Based on Bob Zellner‘s autobiography &lt;em&gt;The Wrong Side of Murder Creek, &lt;/em&gt;this Spike Lee-produced movie tells the story of the son and grandson of Ku Klux Klan members who joins the civil rights movement during the 1960s. Lucas Till, Lucy Hale, Julia Ormond, and Cedric the Entertainer star in &lt;em&gt;Son of the South, &lt;/em&gt;which hits theaters in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kY54OZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhQu4tcHLeU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="innAsn"&gt;The World to Come&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mjx0v0"&gt;I thought I recognized Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in seasons 1 and 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;) in this trailer (I did!). It’s a romance between two women set in the US in the 1800s. Kirby plays new neighbor Tallie, who connects with farmer’s wife Abigail (Katherine Waterston) as the pair battle loneliness and isolation (and awful husbands). Casey Affleck and Christopher Abbott also star in &lt;em&gt;The World to Come&lt;/em&gt;, which is due in theaters February 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O77qfD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla sues former employee for allegedly stealing software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZIf8QzcGleUN7B49rtr83yLgJY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713397/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3aRB4"&gt;Tesla is suing a former employee for allegedly stealing company information, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/tesla-sues-former-employee-for-allegedly-stealing-software-code.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company says software engineer Alex Khatilov stole files from Tesla’s internal network related to its Warp Drive software, used to automated many of the company’s business processes. Tesla alleges in the lawsuit that Khatilov moved files to his personal Dropbox account, and that he was one of only a few Tesla employees who had access to the files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsGtDZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22256438/491775490_Tesla_Inc_v_Alex_Khalitov_Case_4_21_cv_00528_YGR.pdf"&gt;According to the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Khatilov told Tesla investigators he “forgot” about moving the files to his personal Dropbox when they confronted him. He &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/22/ex-staffer-being-sued-by-tesla-denies-he-stole-massive-cache-of-code/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in an interview that he had unintentionally moved the files to Dropbox, and, had been unaware that Tesla had filed a lawsuit against him until the newspaper contacted him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhYddn"&gt;Tesla has not hesitated to sue in order to protect its proprietary data in the past; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755428/tesla-martin-tripp-settlement-whistleblower-hacing-amount"&gt;in December the company settled&lt;/a&gt; with former process technician Martin Tripp, who admitted to leaking confidential information to a reporter. In 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275617/tesla-former-employee-lawsuit-trade-secret-theft-zoox-xpeng-feature"&gt;Tesla sued self-driving startup Zoox&lt;/a&gt; accusing four Zoox employees —who had previously worked at Tesla— of taking confidential documents. That case was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222763/tesla-zoox-startup-lawsuit-settlement-autonomous-driving"&gt;settled last April, with Zoox admitting&lt;/a&gt; that “certain of its new hires from Tesla” were in possession of Tesla documents. And its case against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20689468/tesla-autopilot-trade-secret-theft-guangzhi-cao-xpeng-xiaopeng-motors-lawsuit-filing"&gt;Guangzhi Cao, who Tesla accuses&lt;/a&gt; of stealing files related to Tesla’s Autopilot system, is still ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber reportedly lays off 185 former Postmates workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeK4IMndXXzD1gtLrouwEbHw12Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713107/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TaCAPP"&gt;Uber has laid off about 185 Postmates workers, and plans to further integrate Postmates’ infrastructure within its Uber Eats segment, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/technology/uber-postmates-layoffs.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Uber acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates in July for $2.65 billion&lt;/a&gt;, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287128/grubhub-just-eat-takeaway-merger-uber-deal-antitrust"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; to buy rival food delivery service Grubhub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS0bly"&gt;Meal delivery has been one bright spot for Uber amid the pandemic, as bookings in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551683/uber-q3-2020-earnings-revenue-loss-delivery"&gt;Uber Eats division rose 135 percent&lt;/a&gt; year-over-year in the third quarter while its ride-hailing segment dropped 50 percent over the same time period. It’s consolidated other parts of the company in a bid to become profitable by the end of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;selling its autonomous vehicles segment to Aurora Innovation&lt;/a&gt; in December, the same month it &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/air-taxi-start-up-joby-acquires-uber-elevate-.html"&gt;sold its Uber Elevate flying taxi division&lt;/a&gt; to Joby Aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqFAJV"&gt;The latest cuts will see Postmates founder and CEO Bastian Lehmann depart the company, along with most of its executive team, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CspnEV"&gt;Uber Eats continues to trail competing food delivery service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563716/doordash-ipo-profit-pandemic-food-delivery-drones"&gt;DoorDash, which went public in December&lt;/a&gt;, and showed a brief period of profitability over the summer. According to market research firm Edison Trends, in the fourth quarter &lt;a href="https://trends.edison.tech/research/food-delivery-and-rideshare-report-oct-2020.html"&gt;DoorDash had 48 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the market share for food delivery services, with the combined Uber Eats/Postmates at 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZRei4"&gt;Uber did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeLRNc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrHc41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX launches record batch of satellites in first in-house rideshare mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7IebwA4RO1P-55e5zp8XqI_r-o=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713095/EsbDiSFXcAASE03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;143 spacecraft inside Falcon 9’s payload fairing  | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0duL6"&gt;SpaceX launched a batch of 143 spacecraft to space from Florida on Sunday morning under the company’s new cost-cutting SmallSat Rideshare Program, breaking the record for the most satellites lofted into space on a single launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqtJ2H"&gt;The Transporter-1 mission kicks off a potentially lucrative business line for SpaceX, which unveiled in 2019 its SmallSat Rideshare Program, essentially a carpool for dozens of satellites of different shapes and sizes. The program offers relatively cheap access to space for small satellite companies starting at $1 million for the first 485 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCyEuj"&gt;Much like a rideshare Uber, a company’s small satellite can hitch a ride to space with other spacecraft instead of buying an entire rocket at a much higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG6kOV"&gt;After scrubbing an initial launch attempt on Saturday due to bad weather, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off 24 hours later from its Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad at 10AM ET, sending a mix of shoebox-sized CubeSats and much heavier microsatellites to a 326-mile-high polar orbit — an unusual trajectory for a Florida launch site. SpaceX launched its first polar mission from Florida in August last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rQqevn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Liftoff! &lt;a href="https://t.co/js3zVM77rH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/js3zVM77rH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SpaceX (@SpaceX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1353357167617732608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UWz9k8"&gt;The launch, SpaceX’s third so far this year, marks the most satellites carried to space on a single rocket, a record previously held by an Indian satellite launch in 2017 carrying 104 satellites. The 143 spacecraft aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 include 48 Earth imaging satellites dubbed SuperDoves from Planet, 17 tiny communications satellites for Toronto-based Kepler, and 30 small satellites for the US and Europe packaged by Berlin, Germany-based Exolaunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fexve"&gt;Also aboard the flight are small capsules of human ashes arranged by Celestis, a spaceflight memorial company. Ten Starlink satellites are also hitching a ride, inching SpaceX toward the 1,000 mark for the number of active satellites in space supporting its broadband internet constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M8qzm"&gt;DARPA, the Pentagon’s R&amp;amp;D agency, pulled out from the rideshare mission earlier this month after its two 187-pound satellites were damaged during launch processing in Cape Canaveral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRthmo"&gt;The Transporter-1 mission, coming just four days after SpaceX launched 60 of its Starlink satellites to space, keeps pace with what’s set to be a remarkably eventful year in orbit as SpaceX, OneWeb and other companies race to build vast constellations of internet-beaming satellites. In the past 16 days, SpaceX has launched more satellites to space than what the entire world launched in any year before 2013, according to data compiled by Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer and expert satellite tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao9SnT"&gt;Rideshare missions on larger rockets appeal to a growing demand for affordable launch services from small satellite companies, ramping up competition with companies like Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit with smaller rockets tailored for dedicated small satellite launches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available at Target</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="orqH4y"&gt;Microsoft’s flagship Xbox Series X is one of the most powerful gaming consoles available right now. If you are having difficulty finding it, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target has restocked the Xbox Series X today&lt;/a&gt;, so you may want to check it out while supplies last. Given the challenge it has been to secure a unit, inventory will likely not last long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IC20Te"&gt;Although no walk-in purchases are available, you will have the option to either have it shipped to your home or request an in-store pickup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jxvtrb"&gt;Like every major hardware launch, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;demand for the Xbox Series X and its competitor, the PlayStation 5, is through the roof&lt;/a&gt;, and the usual problems of supply and demand are exacerbated by the fact that both next-gen consoles launched during a pandemic. Many retailers have sold the console exclusively online. The biggest struggle has been trying to guess when and where the next PS5 or Xbox Series X / S restock will happen, and there is no clear indication of when they will resume in-store walk-in purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Italian watchdog tells TikTok to block users whose ages can’t be verified</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lf99npg-mxd36DIPy6oOElswR5Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68710990/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bSdSWn"&gt;Italy’s data privacy authority has ordered video sharing app TikTok to temporarily block the accounts of any users whose ages can’t be confirmed, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-tiktok-idUSKBN29R2H6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The order comes after the death of a 10-year-old girl in Palermo, whose parents told authorities their daughter was participating in a “blackout challenge” she saw on the app. The child died of asphyxiation, and authorities are investigating whether anyone invited her to try the challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjtZ79"&gt;The Italian Data Protection Authority &lt;a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9524224"&gt;ordered TikTok &lt;/a&gt;to block unverified users in Italy until at least February 15th. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/23/italy-blocks-tiktok-for-certain-users-after-death-of-girl-allegedly-playing-choking-game"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it had not found content on its platform which would have encouraged the child to participate in the challenge, but said it was cooperating with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYNacv"&gt;“Privacy and safety are top priorities for TikTok and we are constantly strengthening our policies, processes, and technologies to protect all users, and our younger users in particular,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a TikTok spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQo8wi"&gt;Under its terms of service, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/strengthening-privacy-and-safety-for-youth"&gt;users must be at least 13&lt;/a&gt; years old to sign up for an account on TikTok, but Italian authorities said it’s easy to get around that rule.  TikTok has a version of its app in the US for children under 13— &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-for-younger-users"&gt;TikTok for Younger Users&lt;/a&gt;— which is meant to limit the content and interaction available to those users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BY5XgM"&gt;As it skyrocketed in popularity, TikTok spent much of the past year adding more privacy controls for younger users’ accounts. It introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222817/tiktok-family-pairing-linked-accounts"&gt;remote parental controls&lt;/a&gt; and allowed parents to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570244/tiktok-parental-controls-family-pairing-private-accounts-search-limits"&gt;change kids’ privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; on the app. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22227871/tiktok-young-teen-privacy-restrictions-default"&gt;TikTok updated the default privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; for users between 13 and 15 years old, putting limits on who can see and comment on their videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otAY1q"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258502/tiktok-complaint-child-privacy-ftc"&gt;children’s privacy advocates have argued that TikTok &lt;/a&gt;does not do enough to protect children on its platform. Its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243312/tiktok-ftc-fine-musically-children-coppa-age-gate"&gt;paid a $5.7 million fine&lt;/a&gt; to the US Federal Trade Commission in 2019 for an earlier version of TikTok called Musical.ly, over allegations it violated the Children’s Online Privacy Act (COPPA) in allowing users under 13 to sign up for the app without their parents’ consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xp2nUB"&gt;The temporary suspension of unverified accounts in Italy bans TikTok from “further processing user data for which there is no absolute certainty of age and, consequently, of compliance with the provisions related to the age requirement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km0Uyf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 23rd 5:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from TikTok spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tiger and the need to complicate the world we grew up in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M3BNQi5xJ4j36GIRyB2-zefDDqc=/27x54:1227x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68710305/Screen_Shot_2021_01_22_at_4.53.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7hF16i"&gt;The year is kicking off with what’s becoming a loose tradition: a documentary about a renowned ‘90s athlete that aims to shade in a more complete picture. This time around, it’s &lt;em&gt;Tiger&lt;/em&gt;, a two-part HBO Sports documentary about golf superstar Tiger Woods. Like &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/em&gt;, which chronicled Michael Jordan’s final season with the Chicago Bulls while reflecting on his entire career, &lt;em&gt;Tiger&lt;/em&gt; attempts to complicate the prevailing narrative of a legend defined by his meteoric rise and equally steep fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6rE16"&gt;Even if you didn’t know golf, you probably knew about Tiger Woods. If you came of age in the ‘90s or early aughts, it was impossible to not know about the man who brought raucous, Michael Jordan-levels of celebrity to golf — a sport so traditionally restrained that Adam Sandler was able to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1emDAYCfVQ"&gt;make a hit comedy&lt;/a&gt; where the only real joke was “what if a golfer got real pissed off all the time?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYU2ca"&gt;Tiger Woods was a phenomenon. He had the sort of generational talent that becomes synonymous with a sport while simultaneously redefining what’s possible — despite (or because of) the fact he was so different from what came before. It also might be why Tiger Woods’ fame as a golfer was equally matched by his notoriety as gossip fodder, as his addictions and indiscretions piled up for a fall as ravenously chronicled as his rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yw9rQu"&gt;Throughout most of its roughly three-hour runtime, &lt;em&gt;Tiger&lt;/em&gt; feels like a &lt;em&gt;Behind the Music&lt;/em&gt; special narrowly focused on Tiger’s life: directors Matthew Heineman and Matthew Hamachek are very interested in Woods’ early years as a child prodigy and the complicated relationship the golfer had with his controlling father. It’s against this backdrop that &lt;em&gt;Tiger &lt;/em&gt;holds the golfer’s entire career and public life up for scrutiny: it portrays his unprecedented successes as owed in part to the arguably abusive upbringing his father gave him and his descent into painkiller addiction and infidelity as the response of a man who was lost after his father died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8vswi"&gt;For the most part, &lt;em&gt;Tiger &lt;/em&gt;is successful at humanizing the person behind the headlines, even if it works at a remove. Woods himself mostly appears in archival footage, with the exception of a brief surprise appearance at the end of the film. His story is mostly told by the people who were around him at the heights of his renown: friends, rivals, journalists, and lovers form a motley crew of people caught up in the hurricane of his fame. It’s a good exploration of the casual dehumanization that’s part and parcel of modern celebrity, but at the same time, the film is so limited in scope that it can’t quite escape the lurid fascination it’s ostensibly critiquing. This is especially true in its second part, which veers into sensationalism by treating Woods’ sex scandal — the second widest-known thing about him — as a suspense narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLci0t"&gt;Much like &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tiger&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; hits the mark. But the production is hindered by its subject’s involvement. Woods didn’t let anyone get too close to home, which means &lt;em&gt;Tiger &lt;/em&gt;is missing the insight you can get with a strong critical lens. Both compensate for this by focusing on the phenomenon of fame over the men themselves. These are stories less about people and more about culture in a way that’s wholly unique to professional sports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqA9nI"&gt;Athletes make for a good measuring stick of our cultural biases because their existence tends to raise certain possibly uncomfortable questions: how much agency do we afford them? How much do we fixate on their perceived moral failings? How much pushback do we give when they don’t stick to sports? Race is an inextricable part of these stories, too. Black athletes make millions for executives and entertain fans — which leads both groups to a strange feeling of ownership over them. It manifests as a benevolent frenzy when they are performing, and it can be terrifyingly hostile when they are not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAQ5YI"&gt;For Woods, that sense of public ownership manifested itself in the continual headlines in the early 2000s about his bad behavior. He wasn’t punished by the public just because of a salacious tabloid culture; he was punished because people felt like he tarnished the lily-white image of professional golf. He stepped out of line. It’s not hard to make the leap to other unfairly maligned athletes: Colin Kaepernick overstepped when he protested police brutality; Serena Williams has been raked over the coals for not being “sportsmanlike enough,” which is code for, ironically, what happens when &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/10/17837598/serena-williams-us-open-umpire-carlos-ramos"&gt;a woman behaves like one of her male colleagues&lt;/a&gt;. Some people who like the Lakers hate that LeBron James is vocal about current events. These biases aren’t new, and they’re not going anywhere. They’re a part of how we tell our pop culture stories, bad-faith arguments that often dictate how these stories are framed in our memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cv59EP"&gt;Yet the first draft of a celebrity narrative is rarely an accurate one. It’s a managed story, carefully orchestrated by publicists and corporate interests. Star power means money, and money must be protected — yet celebrity also dictates that famous people appear relatable, that the wider public be privy to some aspects of their personal lives. And thus, infamy is sticky. If you’re Tiger Woods, the headlines can be hard to shake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aD6Dgp"&gt;It’s also rare that pop culture affords the notorious a careful reappraisal. Lately, the stars of ‘90s gossip headlines are getting a better rap than most, sitting at the confluence of an industry in dire need of content and an audience voracious for new stories about the heroes they grew up with. Though it’s imperfect, &lt;em&gt;Tiger&lt;/em&gt; can serve as a reminder that the easy stories aren’t necessarily the ones we should be telling. In truth, we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; meet our heroes — and think about who the villains really are, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says ‘configuration change’ caused some users to be logged out unexpectedly</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23eKMK"&gt;Facebook says some users were logged out of their accounts unexpectedly Friday due to a “configuration change,” and the issue has been fixed as of Saturday morning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plFk08"&gt;“On January 22, a configuration change caused some people to be logged out of their Facebook accounts. We investigated the issue and fixed it for everyone earlier today. We’re sorry for the inconvenience,” a Facebook company spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZK6SVO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So Facebook, heard it was a "configuration change".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    to the engineers who fixed the issue and patiently tried to explain the cause to us to no avail. &lt;a href="https://t.co/AUARhCZ7W2"&gt;https://t.co/AUARhCZ7W2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook App (@facebookapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/facebookapp/status/1352950739249762305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ieW16K"&gt;The problems began late Friday ET, with users on the r/Facebook Reddit board &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/l346n3/did_anyone_else_get_prompted_to_sign_in_again_to/"&gt;reporting they were receiving “sign in” prompts&lt;/a&gt; from their Facebook apps, but they had not signed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeirJE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-iphone-outage-logout-061740231.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; found that iPhone users&lt;/a&gt; appeared most affected by the log-out issue, noting that users of Facebook’s iOS app were having difficulty logging back into their accounts when using two-factor authentication. Most were able to log back in, but the authentication codes needed were taking a long time to reach users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5aDYW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A year into coronavirus, we’re still counting the dead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nlrON2"&gt;A year ago this week, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075647/us-wuhan-coronavirus-case-china-deaths-virus-illness"&gt;first story about the virus&lt;/a&gt;. It was January 21. The first case had arrived in the US. We’d only heard of about 300 cases reported in China and six deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJDRfC"&gt;We still knew there was a chance it could get bad. “It’s bringing back SARS flashbacks for me,” coronavirus expert Timothy Sheahan told &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter Nicole Wetsman at the time. The 2002 SARS outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075647/us-wuhan-coronavirus-case-china-deaths-virus-illness"&gt;taught researchers speed&lt;/a&gt;, but was only a deadly teaser to the still-unnamed pandemic that was about to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0Xq2y"&gt;One year and almost 1,000 coronavirus-related articles later, we’ve passed more grim milestones than we ever should have. More than 97 million people have contracted the virus and 2.1 million people have died. In just one year, more people in the US have died than US soldiers did in &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; years in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ThyLC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One year and almost 1,000 coronavirus-related articles later&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocbq2x"&gt;There are moments where I stop and look back at the broken path behind us — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176170/coronavirus-response-donald-trump-resign-crisis-pandemic-response"&gt;potholed with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573041/coronavirus-vaccine-trump-transition-problems-concede-election-results"&gt;incompetence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153035/coronavirus-response-trump-vaccine-covid19-cdc-who-health-crisis"&gt;arrogance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/1/29/21111849/coronavirus-misinformation-hoaxes-facebook-youtube-twitter-china"&gt;ignorance&lt;/a&gt;. In my head, the milestones are rough and faded, and pass by in a blur — sun-stained photos hanging limply at roadside memorials. People that didn’t have to die, but who are nonetheless gone in a crash, in a silence, in a breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Xntvg"&gt;This week, we finally got a chance to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/19/22239594/joe-biden-inauguration-covid-19-memorial"&gt;slow down and remember them&lt;/a&gt;. 400 lights lit up around the reflecting pool in Washington, DC. One for each of a thousand lives extinguished by the virus in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jV6eCv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r9Xdnh"&gt;The roll of the dead keeps growing. But in the creeping darkness, there’s also a growing feeling of hope. It was the nursing homes that terrified me eleven months ago. I remember that pit in my stomach in late February when I first saw the reports of an outbreak in a Washington state nursing home — one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/29/21159204/coronavirus-us-death-washington-king-county"&gt;the first known outbreaks in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Even then, we knew that the people there were especially vulnerable to the virus, which thrives where people congregate and preys on people fighting other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evwMxr"&gt;Less than a year later, that same nursing home is fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rd30A7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update on this story: Residents and staff at Life Care Center of Kirkland received their second dosage on Monday. The very first outbreak site in the U.S. is fully vaccinated. &lt;a href="https://t.co/D4boxbiX3A"&gt;https://t.co/D4boxbiX3A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paige Cornwell (@pgcornwell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pgcornwell/status/1351647321935626240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xgVAnw"&gt;Across the country in Connecticut, &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-nursing-home-deaths-20210121-uuxw2ksygzentmjbc3hmqldvnq-story.html"&gt;case numbers in nursing homes have dropped sharply&lt;/a&gt; after residents and staff got vaccinated. These are small, stolen moments of joy in a year that has been both frantic and sad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOvNJu"&gt;After a year of covering this, grappling with the pain this tiny virus is causing hasn’t gotten any easier. Every obituary to a life lost is still a heartbreak. I still tear up when I see the joy of a nurse getting vaccinated. I still ache for the living whose lives have been upended by crisis for a year or more. Overall, I’m still going, and so are all of you. We’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21239689/coronavirus-pandemic-end-covid19-reopen-vaccine-treatment-testing"&gt;still not there yet&lt;/a&gt;, but we can hope that the road ahead of us is shorter and smoother than the one we’ve just come down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIiFIe"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week. &lt;/p&gt;

Some infected people have no symptoms, while others endure symptoms that last for months. Researchers think that some severe cases of disease may be caused by autoimmunity, or the immune system attacking the body instead of the virus.

The FDA recently changed the language in Pfizer’s vaccine authorization — now each vial will count for six doses instead of five.

It’s also been an unequal chaos, and Black Americans are getting vaccinated at much lower rates than their white counterparts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="piKuYg"&gt;For months, I have had a bag of baby monitors under the cramped desk in the tiny room that serves as my office at the hospital where I work as a high-risk obstetrician. They are not special baby monitors; they are the same ones you could buy on Amazon or at CVS. They’re stacked alongside a plastic bin full of clogs and a box of unused printer paper—the kind of things you can’t quite throw out, because you might need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0rQMvh"&gt;As quickly as the chills, fever and fatigue appeared, they were gone. Like the movie “Groundhog Day,” I would relive the worst of Covid over and over until, one day, hopefully, I would not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2021 won’t stream in 4K, but these TV deals are still worth it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio P-Series Quantum X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plhVAm6hNhCMb_oJd2fE7nPflc4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68710051/vizioqled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iSOXZU"&gt;In news that’s likely to be devastating to people who are looking for any and all reasons to upgrade their TV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242680/super-bowl-lv-4k-hdr-cbs-sports-stream-not-available-2021"&gt;CBS announced that Super Bowl LV won’t be broadcast in 4K HDR&lt;/a&gt;. The decision was made because of complications caused by the pandemic. This likely isn’t going over too well with all of the TV manufacturers that use the Super Bowl as the moment to clear out 2020 models at a big discount. But there are other reasons to seize these deals while they’re around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4h004"&gt;There’s more 4K content than ever, with HBO Max’s &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; being one of the big new releases to support 4K HDR. One of the TVs mentioned below has HDMI 2.1 ports, giving it the ability to display certain PS5 and Xbox Series X games at 4K resolution with up to 120 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUQLpL"&gt;If you’re not into TVs, though, we’ve included a few other deals for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Im3aHv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CIfOFY"&gt;Check out these great 4K TV deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BWQadr"&gt;Vizio’s 65-inch P-Series Quantum X (pictured above) is about $330 off its usual price right now at a few retailers. This model sits near the top of the company’s TV offerings, and its specs also put it near the top of what you can get in a QLED 4K TV right now. It features 384 local dimming zones for great contrast, and for gamers, its HDMI 2.1 support will let you get the most out of your Xbox Series X, PS5, or PC built with a recent Nvidia RTX graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Txu3Y1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295302"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj2Xbb"&gt;Hisense is also discounting a few of its big-screened 4K HDR TVs. The 75-inch H8G model with Android TV software built in for easy movie and TV show streaming is $1,300 right now at Walmart. Like the P-Series Quantum X above, this one has a quantum dot LED screen, which can offer better contrast and more accurate lighting than your average LED display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="4493fz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHisense-75-Class-Quantum-4K-ULED-2160P-HDR10-Android-Smart-LED-TV-75H8G%2F131920651&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Visit Walmart to get this TV for $1,300 (originally $1,900)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gQvefI"&gt;If you value size over core specs, Best Buy is selling the 85-inch Hisense H65 model for $1,400 (normally $1,700). It’s bigger than either TV mentioned above, and it similarly has Android TV built in, in case you want to get into watching Netflix right after you unbox it. But it likely won’t stack up if you’re particular about picture quality, particularly when it comes to contrast and accurate backlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="CIH40g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730165821772347959" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check out this deal at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lYKRls"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qoMDXT"&gt;HBO Max’s 20 percent discount has been extended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gcKJ6a"&gt;Remember last week when I warned that the deal that gets you 20 percent off a six-month subscription of HBO Max was coming to an end? Well, WarnerMedia extended it to March 1st. So you have even more time to take advantage of this offer. The fine print: it’s open to new and returning users, and instead of paying $90 for six months of service, it’s about $70. Though, you need to pay in full and upfront to get this deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jSpZMW"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d5ijGG"&gt;You have one more week to preorder Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sQJIPF"&gt;Samsung’s next family of Galaxy S-series phones releases on January 29th. You have until January 28th to preorder one, and with that, you’ll receive some preorder perks. My colleague Taylor Lyles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225628/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-preorder-how-to-price-verizon-tmobile-sprint"&gt;has all of the details&lt;/a&gt; on the cost from various retailers and carriers in this post, but no matter where you get an S21, S21 Plus, or S21 Ultra, you’ll get up to $200 in Samsung credit, in addition to a free Galaxy SmartTag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJK1RI"&gt;While I have you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn shared his thoughts&lt;/a&gt; on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, a phone that makes good where last year’s model over-promised and under-delivered. The photo quality and its gorgeous high refresh rate screen are worth reading more about.&lt;/p&gt;
