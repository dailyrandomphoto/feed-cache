    <title>Apple will require masks again in most of its US stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Store Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tdZEjxMAhexg8qebj3MM6MGIQUg=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646869/1234211745.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MejYUc"&gt;Apple will be requiring customers and staff at most of its more than 270 US retail stores to wear masks even if they are vaccinated, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-28/apple-to-restore-mask-mandate-at-most-stores-for-shoppers-staff?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, bringing back a requirement that had been removed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;starting in June&lt;/a&gt;. The change goes into effect Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvlBaF"&gt;“After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store,” Apple informed workers in a memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members — even if they’re vaccinated.” Apple employees who work in its corporate offices have also been told they must wear masks inside of Apple office buildings, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zea24U"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FBDbiP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;COVID-19 case rates are rising in many parts of the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6DaVc"&gt;The move comes as COVID-19 case rates are rising in many parts of the country and on the heels of new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations advising people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors in public if “you are in an area of substantial or high transmission” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595945/cdc-mask-recommendations-vaccinated-delta"&gt;that were issued Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBDwI5"&gt;Google also upped its response to COVID-19 on Wednesday, saying that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;it would require employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; before they can return to the office and delaying its full return to offices from September to October 18th. Apple has also pushed its return to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;until October at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to back up your Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mobile Apps Logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_qYiiPCwbHDr6-6f1ksYauLsrkE=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67061348/1202324974.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration byJakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEk1VN"&gt;You may be switching jobs, or maybe you’ve decided to stop using a specific email account, or maybe you just want a copy of all your email just in case. Whatever your reasons, it’s not a bad idea to back up and export your Gmail and other Google accounts using Google’s Takeout feature. In fact, you can set your accounts to back up regularly, which is a good practice in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHv2wD"&gt;One note: if you’re backing up a company account, you may find that your company has disabled Takeout. There are third-party apps that say they can back up your Gmail, but you should check your company’s policies before you try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eqmXEa"&gt;How to back up your Gmail:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tSrRu9"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://myaccount.google.com"&gt;myaccount.google.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cUmMit"&gt;Under Privacy &amp;amp; personalization, click on “Manage your data &amp;amp; personalization.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jQxw4O"&gt;Scroll down to “Download or delete your data.” Click on “Download your data.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Download your data.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnjgP2ZuLUnv4DgyLz5deC8Vdp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746414/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_3.09.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Download your data.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="d7ZbuT"&gt;This will take you to the Google Takeout page. Under “Select data to include” check the box next to Gmail and any other apps you want to back up. (Note that some services have buttons labeled “Multiple formats.” Click on that button to choose the format in which your data will be downloaded.)  Then click “Next step.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Takeout options" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqGgLY_YmHk3pAx5iHszj_GFHe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20085106/Screen_Shot_2020_07_15_at_11.30.46_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down and make sure Mail is selected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="74EAz9"&gt;To decide how you want to receive your data, click the arrow underneath “Delivery method” to see your options, including emailing a download link or adding it to your Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or Box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QnDti0"&gt;You can also choose whether to export just one time or every two months (for up to a year), and you can choose the type of file and the maximum file size. (If the file size is larger than your maximum, it will be separated into multiple flies; and any files larger than 2GB will use the zip64 compression format.) After you’re done making your selections, click “Create export.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Takeout settings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jRv-CUA9YW0MN9PlYhtaQbUh_vM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20084890/Screenshot__181_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here you’ll find the options for exporting your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="14Vcmh"&gt;Your export will start. Be prepared to wait; it might take days to finish. You can also click “Cancel export” or “Create another export.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Export progress" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPAOqDp5_CaLFL3S5GfJTnKXsbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20084891/Screenshot__184_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get this message when your export starts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kRUlKP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 28th, 2021, 3:30PM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on July 15th, 2020. The introduction, along with some of the directions and screenshots, have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s business is doing better than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4M40BzTae-wOL81LTfxdezGJCs=/0x1:7371x4915/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646845/1327685551.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DPOhJz"&gt;If you pay even the slightest attention to tech news, you’ve probably recently seen nonstop criticism of Facebook’s handling of COVID-19 misinformation, along with a barrage of negative headlines tied to a new book about the company called &lt;em&gt;An Ugly Truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVwUoZ"&gt;These headlines generally paint the picture of a tech giant that is on the outs with users, advertisers, lawmakers, and its Silicon Valley peers. But as the world’s largest social network showed Wednesday, the reality of how its business is performing couldn’t be more opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zt7sz"&gt;Facebook said its revenue grew 56 percent in the second quarter to $29 billion, meaning it grew faster during the period than Apple or Microsoft. More impressively, its profit grew an astounding 101 percent to $10.4 billion. Daily users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp increased 12 percent from the same time last year to 2.76 billion. Non-advertising revenue — namely sales of the Oculus Quest VR headset — grew at a more modest rate of 36 percent. And Apple’s new ad tracking prompt for iPhone apps didn’t materially hurt ad revenue like some expected, though Facebook indicated that the worst is ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqeNXY"&gt;In prepared remarks to investors, Facebook CFO David Wehner said to expect revenue growth to “decelerate significantly” in the second half of this year, mainly due to a momentary boost in usage last year during pandemic lockdowns. He also cited “regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates” from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4uMlU"&gt;Facebook’s stock price has ballooned 39 percent since the beginning of this year, but the warning about a coming growth slowdown spooked investors, sending its stock down about 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGmQdZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard employees walk out of work to protest rampant sexism and discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWb20ocgpi9WN2IzMgKzSKcmj3M=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646809/zschiffer_210728_4684_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photography by Zoe Schiffer / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘Until these demands are met, we won’t stop fighting’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5MQAn0"&gt;Wednesday morning, hundreds of Blizzard employees rallied outside the company’s main campus in Irvine, California to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment and discrimination charges. They’re asking the gaming studio to agree to four demands, including ending mandatory arbitration in all employment contracts. “Until these demands are met, we won’t stop fighting,” a walkout representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFMYuh"&gt;The move comes after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;sued Activision Blizzard on July 20th&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the company had a pervasive “frat boy” culture where female employees were constantly harassed, discriminated against, and underpaid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4YQtd"&gt;The lawsuit alleged a male employee nicknamed his BlizzCon 2013 hotel room the “Cosby Suite.” &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;A Kotaku investigation&lt;/a&gt; later found that multiple other employees were aware of the name. “We’re really glad to see these stories are being told and appreciate the journalists who are telling these stories,” a walkout representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We stand by the victims and are appalled by what we read. This only makes us more committed to our task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQsHe1"&gt;At the protest, employees stood shoulder to shoulder across two city blocks, holding signs that read “send the frat boys back to school” and “women in the video game industry deserve a safe place to work.” The energy was hopeful, almost light, despite the 80-degree heat. There were no protest chants, just chatter among colleagues. Around the corner, organizers had erected a tent for protestors, complete with water and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgdkAnfCEO86oQ3u6CMLSkMCipM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746633/zschiffer_210728_4684_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photography by Zoe Schiffer / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cqZvbv"&gt;Employees say the lawsuit was a watershed moment for the company, which previously isolated victims of sexual harassment. “There was validation, and there was education,” a walkout representative says. “It was a way for people to realize that if they experienced something like this they were not an isolated case. And there was an opportunity for folks who maybe did partake in this but did not realize that it’s toxic behavior to learn that it’s toxic behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpDiR5"&gt;Journalists were instructed not to speak directly with protestors, for fear footage of the conversations would out sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlUqFc"&gt;These anxieties aren’t entirely unfounded. During its two-year investigation, DFEH found numerous instances of retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgzxv5"&gt;Activision Blizzard initially denied the allegations, with chief compliance officer Frances Townsend saying, “we cannot let egregious actions of others, and a truly meritless lawsuit, damage our culture of respect and equal opportunity for all employees,” &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/activision-blizzard-fallout-lawsuit-9306c0a1-b4f1-46d8-925d-90a6086d193f.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Townsend previously served as homeland security advisor to George W. Bush. She joined Activision Blizzard in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zglcMR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re taking something that has existed and permeated through the gaming industry for decades and beginning to build a movement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DbNrYA"&gt;On Tuesday, CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;wrote a public letter&lt;/a&gt; calling the initial response “tone deaf.” He noted the company was engaging WilmerHale, an outside law firm, to audit its “policies and procedures.” Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178609/pinterest-wilmer-hale-workplace-culture-report-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;Pinterest hired WilmerHale&lt;/a&gt; to investigate its company culture after two prominent Black women who’d worked at the company went public with allegations of racism and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0baQO"&gt;Activision Blizzard employees say the latest note from executives — while encouraging — does not go far enough. “Right now they aren’t listening to us,” a walkout representative says. “They’ve made that very clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcI6Ad"&gt;In addition to taking forced arbitration out of employment contracts, employees want the company to overhaul its hiring and promotion processes, publish salary and promotion data, and hire an outside firm to audit the executive team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjltn9RgQQpX7qUMoONcb6WU5mM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746635/zschiffer_210728_4684_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photography by Zoe Schiffer / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WeKwsq"&gt;They say that ending mandatory arbitration is particularly important so employees who’ve experienced harassment can come together to push for change. Doing so would “remove the feeling of isolation and allow for more solidarity with one another,” a walkout representative says. “In addition to that, it helps mitigate the risk of retaliation — that is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NLvBbQ"&gt;Employees won’t say what actions they have planned next. When asked if staff plans to unionize, organizers simply said, “no comment.” Still, they made it clear the walkout is not the end. “We’re taking something that has existed and permeated through the gaming industry for decades and beginning to build a movement,” a spokesperson says. “So it’s important to remember where we came from with our demands, what the end goal is and not lose sight of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says infrastructure deal includes $65 billion for broadband</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Participates In Campaign Event For Virginia Gubernatorial Candidate Terry McAuliffe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-aHvyOs3pl8XV_ocsn75SGspjc=/0x0:5088x3392/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646655/1234138315.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OEeePl"&gt;On Wednesday, bipartisan Senate negotiators &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-historic-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/"&gt;reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; on an infrastructure package after weeks of tense discussion. The package includes billions in new funding, including more money to connect every household to high-speed broadband, according to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDaqM2"&gt;The Senate’s infrastructure package is expected to be around $1.2 trillion over the next eight years with around $559 billion in new spending. The White House sent out a press release Wednesday outlining what’s included in the bill, focusing on “hard” infrastructure issues like roads, bridges, EV charging, public transit, and high-speed broadband. Specifically, the package includes a $65 billion “investment ensuring every American has access to reliable high-speed internet,” according to the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ldbnvC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Telecom companies that receive this funding will be required to offer “low-cost affordable” internet plans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8QTXk"&gt;Telecom companies that receive this funding will be required to offer “low-cost affordable” internet plans to consumers along with easy ways to “comparison shop” amongst providers. Still, the bill text remains unwritten and it’s unclear how the new investment in broadband will be delegated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gELow"&gt;The $65 billion figure is significantly lower than what President Joe Biden originally proposed last March. The administration’s initial goal was to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;pass $100 billion in broadband spending&lt;/a&gt; and include language that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397778/biden-infrastructure-broadband-digital-divide-municipal-networks-republicans"&gt;prioritize networks&lt;/a&gt; affiliated with local governments, nonprofits, and cooperatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEKEK2"&gt;The White House also announced Wednesday that the package would include language from the Digital Equity Act that would create a permanent program to subsidize the cost of broadband for low-income families along with a new program to help pay for devices like laptops and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87Enq8"&gt;As the Senate moves to start voting on this package tonight, the agency in charge of broadband expansion, the Federal Communications Commission, is still without a permanent leader. Earlier this year, former FCC Chair Ajit Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the agency deadlocked with two Republicans and two Democrats. Biden has yet to appoint a fifth commissioner or formally appoint a permanent chair.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google remembers Voice exists, adds new missed call and caller ID features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73GmjMEHt8eQx-ovsoZSkiUmgHQ=/60x0:1707x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646522/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_11.14.27_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sdrNRB"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/enhancements-to-google-voice.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it’s adding new caller ID, missed call, and SMS message features to Google Voice on Wednesday. The otherwise minor update is notable because Google Voice has fallen to the wayside while Google focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;on other messaging boondoggles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pD2xqC"&gt;From the missed calls or voicemail sections of the mobile Google Voice app, you can now learn why you might have missed a call (for example, Do Not Disturb was on), and receive directions on how to make sure that doesn’t happen again (turning Do Not Disturb off). Google is also making it easier to redial dropped calls and switch to your mobile network if your Wi-Fi connection was the reason your call failed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eVAqTYpNg6wfH3PMVityxc2_rWM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746295/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Voice can tell you why you missed a call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sUqQCE"&gt;If you use Google Voice on iOS to forward calls to your personal number, now you can have the app display your Google Voice number on caller ID rather than the original linked number. SMS messages can now be deleted in bulk on the web version of Google Voice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3YYTT"&gt;Google’s various attempts to connect people outside of Gmail have long been somewhat confused — we’ve even made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;a timeline of the journey so far&lt;/a&gt; — but Voice, in particular, has felt forgotten in the wake of Google Fi offering a more traditional phone service. Voice received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17687862/google-voice-icon-dnd-ios-update"&gt;a redesign in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/08/dark-theme-now-available-for-google.html"&gt;a dark mode in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but as a business-oriented Workspace product, it hasn’t really received as many dramatic evolutions as Google’s wild stabs at text and video chats. For the committed Google Voice user not at risk of forgetting the service exists, that might be for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s the evidence a fired Blizzard developer’s ‘Cosby Suite’ existed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3G6kvN9mc6N1nNo-63vYWAJVtOI=/0x0:924x616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646496/cosby_suite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K5qQmW"&gt;As employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;walk out of Activision Blizzard today&lt;/a&gt; over allegations of “constant sexual harassment” and workplace discrimination — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;how poorly they felt the company responded&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; has released &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; backing up allegations that a fired developer kept a hotel suite named after alleged rapist Bill Cosby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbSPHK"&gt;In case you’re catching up, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the state of California sued Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for gender discrimination last week. The allegations include claims specifically naming Alex Afrasiabi, the former senior creative director of &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft. &lt;/em&gt;The suit says that on top of sexually harassing women, Afrasiabi had a hotel room during BlizzCon 2013 nicknamed the “Cosby Suite” — and it suggested that other employees knew about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz219z"&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;’s report nor the California lawsuit say anyone was sexually abused specifically in the Cosby Suite, but it’s increasingly clear the suite was a real thing. As you can see above, there’s a picture of alleged Blizzard developers literally holding up a framed photo of Bill Cosby. &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; says the suite was “a hot spot for informal networking at BlizzCon ... where people looking to make inroads at the company would go to meet and hang out with some of its top designers.” One source told &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; that the original intent wasn’t sexual — saying it was a reference to Cosby’s “iconic ugly sweaters” — but Cosby already faced multiple sexual assault accusations at the time and other sources apparently understood it as a reference to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08Vuyg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; says it has a Facebook album full of photos from the suite, comments of a sexual nature, screenshots of an alleged chat with several named Blizzard developers identifying themselves as the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew,” and sources attesting to the existence of a “boys club” there. One former Blizzard designer allegedly bragged in comments about “gathering the hot chixx for the Coz.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBwlZG"&gt;It’s not clear how serious the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew’s” statements were intended to be, but Activision Blizzard confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; that it terminated Afrasiabi after it was made aware of the complaint’s allegations last month. That’s something the company hadn’t previously revealed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Mo6SA"&gt;You can read &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;the full report at &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Is Robinhood really democratizing finance?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhXuuR9misRtxGy5wRzHBt7WozE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69646072/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ksr0Ml"&gt;Robinhood is scheduled to price its stock today before trading begins tomorrow, and yesterday, it disclosed a new investigation: the finance industry’s self-regulator is checking to see whether founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt should be registered with them. Currently, the co-founders aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc6ncp"&gt;Is this a big deal? Maybe, I don’t know. I don’t work at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an organization you may remember from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;the historic fine&lt;/a&gt; it leveled against Robinhood — $70 million — for, among other things, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;the outages that took place in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. (About $12 million went to the people who were harmed, and the rest went to FINRA because that’s Wall Street, baby.) I am somewhat less concerned with FINRA’s investigation than I am with how this was disclosed: in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021014488/robinhoods-1a2.htm"&gt;an amended version of Robinhood’s prospectus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeKMnm"&gt;The prospectus is the regulatory filing investors are encouraged to read before they decide to put money into an IPO. It is very long. If you want to find the exact disclosures, I suggest CTRL+f (or CMD+f) for “on July 26, 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zIeZrN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I am now under the impression that Robinhood expects its retail investors aren’t reading the prospectus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vzhwuf"&gt;As part of its go-public plan, Robinhood is offering an unprecedented amount of its IPO to retail investors &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the public trading starts tomorrow. Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ee755c02-dd09-4041-8b14-efad30a662a6"&gt;more than a third&lt;/a&gt; of its shares will go to users of its app, who — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;as Robinhood has also told us in its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; — are often first-time investors (more than half of its customers!). I watched the roadshow for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22592076/robinhood-ipo-roadshow-tenev-questions"&gt;those investors on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, and I did not get the impression that the presentation was for sophisticated investors. This is partly because Tenev wasted time on a question about his favorite planet but also because some of the questions Robinhood chose to answer in the presentation &lt;em&gt;were in the prospectus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GREfpH"&gt;I am now under the impression that Robinhood expects its retail investors aren’t reading the prospectus. That’s why putting the FINRA thing in there has my eyebrows at my hairline. I know there are restrictions on what a company can say before it goes public, but &lt;a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/quiet-period"&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission allows&lt;/a&gt; companies to communicate about “factual business information” during the quiet period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td5Rm8"&gt;“I’m curious about why this is coming out now,” says Robert Le, a senior analyst at Pitchbook. “Why is it coming out on the eve of the IPO?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsOlm1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/investing/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-finra/index.html"&gt;CNN first reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tenev, Robinhood’s CEO, and Bhatt, the company’s chief creative officer, weren’t registered with FINRA in February. FINRA has a rule about firms, called broker-dealers, that trade securities on behalf of their customers: their CEOs must be registered. But Tenev is the CEO of Robinhood Markets, the parent company, which is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a broker-dealer. What &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;registered with FINRA is a subsidiary. In the February report, Robinhood told CNN that Tenev “does not directly manage the FINRA-registered leaders of the broker-dealer or clearing broker” and “declined to say who does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tn3ysF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the Robinhood democracy, everyone is equal — but some are more equal than others&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pzh0ky"&gt;Okay. It’s not clear to me that Tenev and Bhatt have &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; done anything wrong here. Our Bitcoin-addled boy, Jack Dorsey, isn’t listed among the registered, for instance — even though his company, Square, has an arm that allows investments, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/04/investing/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-finra/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. In its initial report on Tenev and Bhatt, the registration concern was “a gray area,” Charles Whitehead, law professor at Cornell Law School, told CNN. “If they are the CEO of a shell company that does nothing more than manage the broker-dealer, that’s an issue,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9ZS1C"&gt;So Square isn’t primarily in the business of investments; payments are the bread and butter, really. With Robinhood, on the other hand, it kind of seems like investments are the entire point. Also, Tenev has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/investing/robinhood-gamestop-vlad-tenev/index.html"&gt;made comments on Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; (in an interview with Elon Musk!) about getting a call at 3AM because he needed to round up $3 billion to give to his clearinghouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYJFyL"&gt;I trust FINRA will sort this out. But however the investigation resolves, it doesn’t strengthen my confidence that Tenev and Bhatt’s big talk about democratizing finance is serious. In fact, it underlines something else in the S-1: the difference in voting rights between Class A stock (what IPO investors get) and Class B stock, which is what the founders get. Class B holders get 10x the voting rights of Class A owners. In the Robinhood democracy, everyone is equal, but — with apologies to George Orwell — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Farm-George-Orwell/dp/0451526341?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some investors are more equal than others&lt;/a&gt;. Tenev and Bhatt didn’t discuss this in the roadshow, and I don’t think it was because the planet question was more important. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Tesla will open up its Superchargers to other EVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWaKGbigAKCU4PtLZFX_uOLsiEY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645971/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X8I4hI"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, talked about opening up his company’s vast Supercharger network to other electric vehicles. But earlier this month, Musk tweeted that Tesla plans to do this “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1417593502351826946"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;,” and this week, he finally offered some details about how it might work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWDAWZ"&gt;It will be “real simple,” Musk claimed on an investor call Monday. Owners of other EVs will be able to charge at a Supercharger station by using the Tesla app — which, right now, is geared toward people who’ve purchased the company’s products. That’s about all Tesla will have to do to make this possible in Europe and China, where there are standardized charging cable connectors, Musk said. (Tesla has already committed to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/24/tesla-confirms-plan-open-supercharger-network-other-automakers-next-year/"&gt;opening up the network in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS3tRq"&gt;But Tesla has a proprietary connector in North America, so non-Tesla vehicles here will need an adapter. That could be up to the other automakers to make; Musk has previously said that Tesla has held talks with other automakers about &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;sharing costs&lt;/a&gt; in order to open up the Supercharger network, and in 2018, he said competitors would have to be “able to accept our charge rate and our connector, at least have an adapter to our connector.” Tesla may still make its own, as Musk said he anticipates making them available at Supercharger stations as long as “people don’t sort of steal them or something.” (Tesla energy lead Drew Baglino assured his boss on the call that his team “has a good solution for that.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="eEyOMB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp;amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s one fairly slim connector for both low &amp;amp; high power charging. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, we’re making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1417593502351826946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2fAnK"&gt;This adapter would likely have to be certified (something typically done by &lt;a href="https://www.ul.com/"&gt;third parties like UL&lt;/a&gt;) and some basic software written to handle the “handshake” that happens between a car and the charger before electrons start flowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZuqAJ"&gt;If Tesla allows other electric vehicles to charge on the Supercharger network, it could be a big boost for the nascent — but growing — EV market. The company has already built out almost 3,000 stations and nearly 27,000 connectors worldwide, which can charge at faster rates than most other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEFl3h"&gt;Plenty of already-open charging networks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"&gt;EVgo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/491057/chargepoint-completed-business-combination-spac/"&gt;ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/01/12/2157472/0/en/Blink-Charging-Announces-Closing-of-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock-for-Total-Gross-Proceeds-of-232-1-Million.html"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; have recently gone public and plan to use much of that fresh funding to expand their networks. But  unlocking the Supercharger network to owners of other EVs could more immediately help alleviate the twin headaches of finding available (and working) chargers and time spent charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otEdFe"&gt;It could be a financial boon for Tesla, too, as Baglino said on an investor call Monday. “Increasing the utilization of the network actually reduces our costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for all customers, makes the network more profitable, allows us to grow the network faster. That’s a good thing there,” he said. Something that went unsaid: the possibility that opening up the network could make Tesla’s superchargers more appealing to government subsidy programs. (President Biden has said he wants to build &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;500,000 charging stations&lt;/a&gt; as part of a $15 billion investment in the technology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elp0F3"&gt;There is at least one big potential hangup for this plan, though: capacity — not the energy kind, but the how-crowded-will-Superchargers-get kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWygGu"&gt;As Tesla’s vehicles become more popular, Supercharger stations in some big cities have gotten crowded. In some respect, that’s good for Tesla — hanging out at Superchargers while you charge is a great way to meet other potentially like-minded Tesla owners, which, in turn, helps grow the company’s legion of devotees. But waiting in line only to then wait again while you charge is a drag, and things will only get more crowded if Tesla opens up the Supercharger network to other EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEv7LY"&gt;To solve this, Musk said Tesla may play with dynamic pricing. For instance, the company could jack up prices if your EV charges at a slower rate than a Tesla because, as Musk said Monday, the “biggest constraint at Superchargers is time.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="b7tV9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a lot of work for the Supercharger team”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kq3IVa"&gt;The bigger blocker, Musk said, is that Tesla is making cars at a faster rate than it’s building new Supercharger stations. Opening the network is “only useful to the public if we’re able to [build Superchargers] faster than Tesla vehicle output,” he said. “So this is a lot of work for the Supercharger team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrf1Uw"&gt;Access to a large, exclusive network of fast charging stations has long been one of the selling points of buying a Tesla, which could make this transition a tricky one, according to Karl Brauer, executive analyst at &lt;a href="http://iSeeCars.com"&gt;iSeeCars.com&lt;/a&gt;. “Elon will have to balance his desire to widen EV charging access — and increase Tesla’s revenue — with keeping his owner body happy,” Brauer said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That may be a bridge too far, even for Elon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvHrMR"&gt;But opening up the network could also be a powerful marketing tool for a company that famously doesn’t spend money on traditional advertising, &lt;em&gt;Autotrader &lt;/em&gt;executive editor Brian Moody said via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EJA2qM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I bet it leads to more Tesla buyers long term.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5T9bqs"&gt;“The smart thing about this idea is that it gradually exposes motorists, especially those who are already interested in EVs, to the Tesla brand. I bet it leads to more Tesla buyers long term,” Moody wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggRXvw"&gt;As much as an exclusive Supercharger network has been a selling point for Tesla, Musk maintained on Monday that he always hoped to open it up to other electric vehicles — and took a shot at another Silicon Valley giant in the process. “Our goal is to support the advent of sustainable energy. It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is sometimes used by some company,” he said, before fake coughing and adding: “&lt;em&gt;Apple&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrpYnq"&gt;It’s something that those other charging networks have also anticipated. In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001821159/000110465921094028/tm2122501d1_s1.htm"&gt;financial filing&lt;/a&gt;, EVgo admitted that Tesla opening up its Supercharger network “could further reduce demand for charging at our sites.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title> United Airlines will let passengers preorder food and snacks online before flights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8e5aSyqgng_2C5R6H8pn3lVV9M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645922/Inflight_Pre_Order_Hero.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANUdow"&gt;United Airlines announced a new option for passengers to preorder food, snacks, and beverages online up to five days before their scheduled flight. Orders can be made either on United’s website or through the airline’s mobile app. United claims that it is the “first and only” carrier to allow economy customers this option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv7Uee"&gt;Previously, only premium customers on certain eligible flights could preorder their food and drinks. Now, United is extending the option to all ticket-holders. To start out, only passengers on flights from Chicago to Honolulu; Orange County, CA; Sacramento, CA; and San Diego will be eligible to preorder food and drinks. But by early fall, United says it will extend the option to passengers of all flights over 1,500 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBfjVk6Wr9dtLJeKM9o61m5u7Kg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745769/Preorder_Multiscreen_Hero_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JYOM41"&gt;United has been adding amenities and eliminating nuisance fees as a strategy to help attract customers back inside its planes. Last year, the airline permanently eliminated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409152/united-delta-airlines-change-fee-eliminate-covid"&gt;change fee policy&lt;/a&gt;, quickly followed by its main rivals, Delta and American. United also recently added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556316/united-airline-bluetooth-in-flight-entertainment-new-jets"&gt;Bluetooth option&lt;/a&gt; for in-flight entertainment. With customer demand still below pre-pandemic levels, the airline industry as a whole is seeking to make flying look safe, stress-free, and, most of all, cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAK361"&gt;United is billing the food and drink preorder option as a way to improve service, allowing flight attendants to move through the cabins faster and delivering more personalized service to passengers. Preorders are handled through United’s contactless payment system, which the airline also claims is safer for passengers and flight attendants (although &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4"&gt;evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; that COVID is rarely transmitted through surface contact). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pM2TSU"&gt;Customers who choose not to preorder their food and drinks can still do so during the flight. But United is urging customers to load their credit card in the app’s digital wallet in order to facilitate contactless payment while on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KgP8r"&gt;Earlier this year, United announced new food and drink menus for flights over two hours, including alcoholic seltzer brand White Claw. &lt;/p&gt;
