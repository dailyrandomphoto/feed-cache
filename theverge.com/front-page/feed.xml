  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhF14P"&gt;Just to let you know up top, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is currently running its back-to-school promotion&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. Granted, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out at Apple’s educational storefront. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the model with 128GB of storage. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage and Wi-Fi for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ipad+2020&amp;amp;qid=1621350979&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSkVCMDZaTjVCV0VFJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDM2OTM2RjNHV0xNUDNHUDk1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyMjg1ODkyMVFXT0lITjVaR0hZJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Both retailers also offer the 128GB, Wi-Fi configuration in multiple colors for $395 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J61NFNR/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ipad%2B2020&amp;amp;qid=1621350979&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSkVCMDZaTjVCV0VFJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDM2OTM2RjNHV0xNUDNHUDk1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyMjg1ODkyMVFXT0lITjVaR0hZJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver%2F252643318%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;latest iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the same A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $399 and $549 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but if you want to buy the 64GB, Wi-Fi-enabled iPad mini right now, it’s &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $369 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ8VVG4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also currently offering the rose gold model&lt;/a&gt; for the same price, as well as a 256GB model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in rose gold for $490&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hupcHm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Redesigned iPad Mini reportedly on track to launch this fall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748078754624462492#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The latter retailer also currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748078982358715795#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;knocking $110 off the 256GB model&lt;/a&gt; with Wi-Fi, while taking an additional &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748079082544379585#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 off the rose gold configuration&lt;/a&gt;. That same $60 discount is available at Amazon for both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J5WFP7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blue models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-gen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is now widely available, which means there are plenty of deals to be had on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iteration of the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in multiple configurations at Best Buy and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB model is &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/3PjGgM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553824-REG%2Fapple_my232ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and the 256GB model is available for $750 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553812-REG%2Fapple_mxdc2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $900 and $1,100, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo, too. If you prefer the Wi-Fi model, the 128GB model is discounted to $900 (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065737279860353#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553840-REG%2Fapple_my2h2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;), the 256GB model to $950 (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;), the 512GB model to $1,100 (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), and the 1TB model to $1,300 (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qw9aaA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important thing to you, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to bring about deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — and new features like Center Stage, a software innovation that zooms and pans to keep you centered in the frame while participating in video calls. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If you do want the latest model, however, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F354993710" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $50 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $749. Walmart is also discounting the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-1TB-Space-Gray%2F507437649%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-2TB-Space-Gray%2F434629461" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB models&lt;/a&gt; to $1,449 and $1,799, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;The 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $999&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date. You can also snag the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $1,099&lt;/a&gt; at Walmart, a $100 discount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max looks to woo new subscribers with free episodes</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZg5gqcsB5INQJoFAS7yz9Bb-4g=/132x0:1826x1129/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674674/unnamed__3_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HBO Max is offering free content to potential users.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HBO Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yTSHrF"&gt;HBO Max is offering free episodes to potential new subscribers in-app and free of charge so they can take its more popular series for a test drive before committing to yet another streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XDgfR"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-now-offers-access-select-free-episodes-app-your-favorite-device"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that, starting today, new viewers mulling a subscription can watch a selection of 13 pilots from HBO and HBO Max without having to sign up for the service. Normally, subscribers would pay $10 per month for HBO Max’s ad-supported tier or $15 per month to go ad-free and get special perks like 4K streaming and day-and-date releases for Warner Bros films. (HBO Max does &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22154553/hbo-max-ditches-one-week-free-trial-ahead-of-wonder-woman-1984"&gt;not currently offer&lt;/a&gt; a free trial.) The full list of series whose pilots can be streaming for free is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="K4WsuP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batwoman &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CcrqDy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6Qutda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rtizAW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rKZhcC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lovecraft Country &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eCJULy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Life &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zV80Ro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perry Mason &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N7XNOn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raised By Wolves &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uFr2t0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flight Attendant &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0Z058X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titans &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yepbm8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veneno &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r3OmiQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warrior &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j8dwwe"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt; (Season 2, episode 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="BKZQYD"&gt;The freebies for potential users will hit the service today, and the company said that new episodes would be swapped in and out “periodically.” The feature will be available on all of HBO Max’s device partners, including Xbox, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Android, iOS, iPad, Apple TV, Chromecast, PlayStation, Roku, Samsung, and, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607655/hbo-max-lg-webos-smart-tv-now-available-united-states"&gt;as of today&lt;/a&gt;, LG smart TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sE3lu"&gt;The introduction of teaser episodes to potential viewers expands HBO Max’s initiative to teasing its content to viewers who may not already be subscribed to the service. Last month, the company launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585753/hbo-max-mini-group-watch-snapchat"&gt;group watch tool&lt;/a&gt; to allow Snapchat users to stream pilots directly through the app for free. Netflix, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;no longer offers&lt;/a&gt; a free trial, has similarly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225143/netflix-doumentaries-free-youtube-our-planet-13th-babies-explained"&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225143/netflix-doumentaries-free-youtube-our-planet-13th-babies-explained"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; to prospective viewers in the past by sharing it on YouTube. HBO Max’s free content slate can be found &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbomax.com%2Fwatch-free&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608403%2Fhbo-max-new-subscribers-free-episodes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 SSD buying guide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWDkBFIMCrtecqUoN0dXd78QXjE=/6x0:1994x1325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674661/ps5ssd2_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xxsstu"&gt;Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;released its first PS5 software beta last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, and with it came the much-anticipated support for adding an M.2 SSD, letting you install more PS5 games than the fairly restrictive 825GB built-in SSD allows. Alongside the beta, Sony provided a &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;list of requirements&lt;/a&gt;, making it clear that you wouldn’t necessarily be able to just grab any SSD and chuck it in your PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E1aa6b"&gt;Which SSDs work with the PS5?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="jV7ZmR"&gt;Sony’s main requirements are that the SSD be PCIe Gen4 and at least 250GB. However, Sony makes it very clear that your SSD needs a heatsink, which can complicate things, given the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1420811116083662855"&gt;limited amount of space in the PS5’s SSD bay&lt;/a&gt;. What SSDs you’ll want to consider depends on whether you want to install a heatsink yourself or not, and whether you’re a “play by the rules” type or a “let’s see what I can get away with” type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrTNPU"&gt;I don’t want any hassle — I want to buy an SSD I know will work, install it, and never think about it again.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FD0cFH"&gt;WD told us that, based on Sony’s requirements, its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fwestern-digital-500gb-black%2Fp%2FN82E16820250184" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WD Black SN850 drives&lt;/a&gt; (available in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB capacities) would work, and that it was in the process of testing compatibility. The drive easily surpasses Sony’s speed recommendations, but you’ll want to make sure you’re buying the version with a heatsink — for the 1TB model, the heatsink version costs $20 more than the non-heatsink version and has a big orange line on the front. It’s also the SSD that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cerny/status/1421686135936348161"&gt;PS5’s lead system architect bought for himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RnZs9N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678003"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XvsMRw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/seagate-confirms-its-first-ps5-ready-ssd-will-cost-275-for-1tb/"&gt;Seagate says&lt;/a&gt; its upcoming &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fseagate-500gb-firecuda-530%2Fp%2FN82E16820248196" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Firecuda 530 drives&lt;/a&gt;, which have the option for an included heatsink, will work in the PS5 as well. When they release at the end of August, it’ll be $160 for a 500GB model, $260 for a 1TB model, and $540 for a 2TB model. You can tell the heatsink models by the orange vertical stripe near the connector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="veXRq1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this is how you upgrade the storage on a PS5 and an Xbox Series X   ‍♂️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/iumF3PCOtV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iumF3PCOtV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1420811116083662855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xK7Cv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A helpful guide to installing an SSD in a PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0rbha4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEGXiB"&gt;I’m willing to put in some work and / or roll the dice a little.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y2wIlm"&gt;For an SSD that meets the speed requirements, Crucial told us its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcrucial-1tb-p5-plus%2Fp%2FN82E16820156280" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;newly announced P5 Plus SSD&lt;/a&gt; is compatible with the PS5, but you’ll need to install your own heatsink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9nyhSC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfPqDn"&gt;Heatsinks should be low profile — for the ones that are just going over the top of the SSD, &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;Sony wants you to add&lt;/a&gt; no more than 8mm of height, including the heatsink and thermal interface. Because of that, low-profile heatsinks like the ones below are going to be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5UZipZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCfuOb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683838"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RutnfF"&gt;If you’re looking to go all-out on speed but are still okay with installing a heatsink, Samsung’s blazingly fast 980 Pro is another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u5Dq1S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fPlE7H"&gt;If you’re looking at the 980 Pro, this heatsink from EK Water Blocks is compatible with single-sided SSDs. It also fits within Sony’s height requirements (and looks pretty, though it’ll be buried in your PS5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2hyUeJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677975"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNr0zx"&gt;If you’re willing to stick to 1TB of storage, Sabrent’s Rocket 4 Plus is another option. It does come in 2TB and 4TB capacities, but those seem to be double-sided, meaning that heatsinks for them are much more difficult to find. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sabrent-rocket-4-plus-m2-nvme-ssd-review"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though, the 1TB version is single-sided, making PS5-compatible heatsinks for it readily available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8CLWhH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ucha1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T7bRzv"&gt;If you’re looking for something that’s got a built-in heatsink, but you’re willing to roll the dice on speed, Patriot’s Viper Gaming SSD matches Sony’s requirements. However, it falls short of Sony’s recommended speed, though it’s still rated as a Gen4 SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="urMepF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OQEv9p"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WpBZfA"&gt;I’m a loose cannon willing to bend the rules to expand my storage.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FyM2Ph"&gt;Some SSDs are double-sided, meaning that they have chips on both the front and back of the PCB. We reached out to StorageIO’s storage analyst and operator Greg Schulz to see if that meant that both sides needed to be covered by a heatsink, and he told us that “the denser the packaging, the more need to remove the heat.” According to him, the heat would have to be dealt with by airflow (which the SSD in the PS5 doesn’t seem to have much access to), or other methods ranging from “heat sinks to small fans to thermo tape among other approaches depending on packaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBWZNn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to find a heatsink compatible with double-sided SSDs and Sony’s size requirements&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNjQg8"&gt;For that reason, we’re putting the double-sided SSDs without included heatsinks into this category. While there are plenty of heatsinks that are compatible with double-sided SSDs, I struggled to find many that weren’t taller than Sony recommended (though we’ll come back to that note in a bit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pd11AB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683818"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RfyjaF"&gt;If you can’t find a double-sided compatible heatsink that fits with Sony’s specifications, you’d either have to run the SSD with a heatsink on only one side and just hope it doesn’t overheat, or you’d have to try to MacGyver on two ultra-slim heatsinks like the ones below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V64oEq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tMxi8y"&gt;So with all those warnings out of the way, here are the SSDs for those who like to live on the edge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eef8LC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;We’ve tested&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsabrent-rocket-nvme-4-0-1tb%2Fp%2F1Z4-00H3-00016" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sabrent Rocket NVMe&lt;/a&gt; ourselves (though without a heatsink). It comes in 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB capacities, and despite the fact that it’s slower than Sony’s recommended speed, it seemed to work just fine. It does &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sabrent-rocket-nvme-40-m2-ssd-review-a-high-performance-value"&gt;appear to be double-sided&lt;/a&gt;, though, so the heatsink situation may be sketchy. The same goes for the 2TB and 4TB versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Internal-Extreme-Performance-SB-RKT4P-2TB/dp/B08P2CG4JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;faster Rocket 4 Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GsEjLU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPio4X"&gt;Our contact at Sabrent told us that he had tested the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F0D9-001Y-00027" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; in a PS5, and that it fit — despite the heatsink’s listed height being way outside Sony’s spec (it’s just over double the height). He says that the console can close back up with the heatsink on, and provided pictures, but it’s still going in this category because of how different it is from Sony’s numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqOonx"&gt;Finally, there’s the PNY XLR8 CS3040. It meets all of Sony’s requirements and recommendations, but it also &lt;a href="https://www.servethehome.com/pny-cs3040-1tb-pcie-gen4-nvme-ssd-review/"&gt;appears to be double-sided&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this means your mileage may vary when it comes to heatsinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fDvOUS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cAY7TT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FFmqmE"&gt;What if I want to find an SSD for myself? What speed and specs should I look for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xB4eVB"&gt;Sony says your SSD has to be at least Gen4 and have at least a 250GB capacity. It also recommends SSDs that run at 5,500MB/s or faster. PCIe Gen3 SSDs aren’t supported (we tried), and neither are SATA ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-pUtS16ODVV1WvJqvxenGHAyRcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748004/photo1627558599.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s requirements screen that shows up when you install an incompatible drive. In this case, it was a Gen3 drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CIxdzv"&gt;What size will fit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OCS8df"&gt;The PS5 is compatible with 2280-type SSDs, which seems to currently be the most widely available size. You can see a list of all the sizes the PS5 supports on Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;requirements page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RTjJiB"&gt;What are Sony’s heatsink requirements?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0XrQbU"&gt;It depends on whether the heatsink goes on one side of the SSD or encloses it on both sides, but Sony has diagrams &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd"&gt;on its requirements page&lt;/a&gt; that show the exact measurements that will fit. Basically, though, SSDs with a built-in heatsink, or a double-sided one attached, can be up to 11.25mm tall. If you’re using a single-sided heatsink, you’re limited to one that adds less than 8mm of height. The maximum height not only includes the heatsink, but the thermal pads you use to attach it to your SSD as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bF75ow7OtsXQRYS1PyYn3_cUVtQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22757183/m2_heatsink_double_sided_en.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony has very specific size / spacing requirements for SSD heatsinks, so you’ll want to pay close attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EVryHS"&gt;You’ll also want to make sure your SSD and heatsink are compatible; heatsinks come in the same sizes as SSDs do, and the sizes have to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQKa8b"&gt;As noted previously, you’ll also want to pay very close attention to whether your SSD is single or double-sided. That can be hard to determine from the product pictures, so you may want to either wait until you actually have your SSD in hand to order your heatsink, or take a careful look at the heatsink’s compatibility list (if it has one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XQFlAs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oxZr7m"&gt;Beta means beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="leqych"&gt;Again, the feature is currently only available to those in beta program, so installing an SSD into your PS5 right now will likely just reward you with a message telling you to uninstall it. Additionally, Sony says that even a drive that matches all its requirements may still not work. If you don’t want to deal with uncertainty, it may be best to wait until there have been more SSDs tested, or there are ones officially certified by Sony available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVGIMR"&gt;However, we know that at least two models work, and that all the rest in this post meet Sony’s requirements. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/install-ps5-system-software-beta/"&gt;apply to the PS5 beta here&lt;/a&gt;, and read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;our PS5 SSD install guide here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByfzID"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/view-once-photos-and-videos-on-whatsapp"&gt;WhatsApp is rolling out&lt;/a&gt; its “View Once” feature today, which deletes photos or videos from your chat after they’ve been opened by the recipient. When sending a photo or video, you can make it view once by tapping the “1” button to the left of the send button. After the recipient opens it, it’ll be deleted. The recipient will be able to see that it’s a disappearing photo, so it’s still the type of thing you’d only want to use for people you trust to not take a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkaq4I"&gt;In June, Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466425/whatsapp-multi-device-support-disappearing-mode-view-once-features-confirmed"&gt;confirmed that the feature would be coming&lt;/a&gt;, though details about when it would release were scarce. &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-photos-and-videos-set-to-view-once/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WaBetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the feature has been in beta for about a month. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7BP8SKBE5QH9dzr94PTwTZ_K8Wo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759545/comp_VIEW_ONCE_EN_16x9_v012_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The recipient will be left with a bubble simply saying “opened.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uYH8tW"&gt;As an example of how the feature could be used, WhatsApp uses the example of sending a photo of sensitive information, like a Wi-Fi password. Of course, there are perhaps other less wholesome uses for this kind of feature. But either way, it’s useful to have an option between the &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages"&gt;app’s disappearing messages&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only go away after a week, and your chat’s permanent record.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat knows when you were born if you used it to check your horoscope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJNyieSH29Be9BmMCj0nFiUduuo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674632/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfgq10"&gt;Despite how things may seem, Snapchat hasn’t learned your birthday or birthplace on its own — you likely told it yourself. The app’s exact knowledge of the exact time, date, and location of a user’s birth has been an issue of some concern for users on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=snapchat%20born&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdT8NfBQ/"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; over the last few days, but it’s due to &lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-astrology"&gt;Snapchat’s Astrological Profile feature&lt;/a&gt; and not some nefarious new skill the app has gained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589236/snapchat-users-293-million-q2-2021"&gt;as it’s soared in popularity over the last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFmv6K"&gt;You can view your “Astrological Birthday” in the settings section of Snapchat, and if you weren’t aware you had already given the app all of that information, it would be a fairly alarming discovery. Checking baby photos will not reveal that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16500522/snap-dancing-hot-dog-costume-halloween-for-sale"&gt;the Snapchat Hot Dog&lt;/a&gt; has been with you since birth, however. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ly20OKFx2Fu9xcY84SzVAVldgeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759204/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_12.35.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/hegotbanks/status/1422637212756332545?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;hegotbanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snapchat’s Birthday menu has a surprising amount of information about your birth — if you forget you told Snapchat yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YsFP61"&gt;Snapchat tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its Astrological Profile feature is the cause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t2ONMh"&gt;The birth date and time information shown above was actually inputted by the users themselves in order to obtain more specific information, stemming from our latest astrological profiles feature. The feature requires exact birth date and time from each person in order to calculate their exact star chart reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PSRNX"&gt; We take the privacy of personally identifiable information very seriously at Snap, and this more granular birth date and time information is used only for this astrological profile feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fykip"&gt;Snapchat &lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/snapchat-astrology"&gt;launched Astrological Profiles in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; as a way for users to share and compare horoscopes on their stories and check their relative compatibility with friends. You already shared your birthday with Snapchat when you made a profile; the new astrological features just took it a step further to ask for the time and location of your birth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ug2SHd"&gt;A side effect of letting Snapchat play astrologer is that the app now has the full details of your birthday and birthplace stored in the “Birthday” section of settings as “My Astrological Birthday.” Snapchat doesn’t share any birth information unless you want it to (at most, that would be your birthdate with friends), and you can delete that specific birth time and location information at any time with a tap. None of these individual pieces of information are particularly damaging on their own, but this is a good illustration of how apps can collect information about you over time, even if it's never meant to be shared or necessarily used by the app at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vnsbp"&gt;Chalk this confusion up more to Snapchat having a lot of (admittedly fun) features that are easy to forget about, and not the fact that, technically, based on when &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat"&gt;Snapchat was originally launched as Picaboo&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a Cancer. It’s a total Cancer move otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xp0fs7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola shows its truck going uphill, for a change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ZWJg_dmzV5lVBLWcRh0sn0vAn4=/535x0:4738x2802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674351/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_3.40.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Tu64H"&gt;Just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;five days&lt;/a&gt; after Nikola founder Trevor Milton was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/us-prosecutors-charge-trevor-milton-founder-of-electric-carmaker-nikola-with-three-counts-of-fraud.html"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt;, in part, for allegedly misleading investors with footage of a moving truck that was secretly rolling downhill, the hydrogen-trucking startup released footage of a newer prototype driving &lt;em&gt;uphill&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2r12O"&gt;The startup showed the video during a &lt;a href="https://www.webcast-eqs.com/nikola20210803/en"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2021-results-126"&gt;second quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. (It also published the footage on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C3uQ10jo0k"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.) While it may be a moral victory for the company to show its truck climbing a 12 percent grade hill in light of the more infamous clip Milton once orchestrated, the release of the footage nonetheless came alongside some bad news: Nikola now expects to deliver half the number of trucks this year than it had originally estimated. Worse, the company said global parts shortages could make it tough to even hit the new, lower target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iQfdDb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3C3uQ10jo0k?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="555TmO"&gt;Nikola was the first high-profile transportation startup to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;merge with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC boom&lt;/a&gt; last year. Many others have followed, including a half-dozen EV startups that also have not made or sold any production vehicles. Nikola is also not alone in drawing regulatory scrutiny, or the attention of prosecutors. The Department of Justice is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;investigating Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is poking around a few other would-be EV manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsFmOt"&gt;But Milton’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;belligerence&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his alleged subterfuge, made Nikola a tantalizing target for closer examination — including from the short-seller research firm Hindenburg Research that kicked off Milton’s downfall. That the company is still around to show that it has a truck that can go up a hill is a small miracle in its own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNEy0a"&gt;As the public spotlight shifts to other startups’ problems, Nikola now has a chance to be among the first of its peers to emerge from this period of intense SPAC merger scrutiny. It has a major reputation overhaul to execute, a parts shortage to navigate, and it’s still losing more than $100 million per quarter. Oh, and it’s also still trying to prove out the basic premise that hydrogen fuel is a practical solution for long-haul trucking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqejTn"&gt;In other words: an uphill climb, though one that seems steeper than 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard’s head of HR is out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3mUWTXbHxCBoyVzyL5foJ09UtEk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674254/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cfE9WS"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack isn’t the only executive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;leaving the company today&lt;/a&gt; after presiding over a culture now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;accused of fostering “constant sexual harassment.”&lt;/a&gt; Jesse Meschuk, the company’s head of global human resources, has also now departed, an Activision Blizzard spokesperson confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/blizzard-president-departs-as-game-maker-faces-labor-lawsuit?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMGt4D"&gt;“Jesse Meschuk is no longer with the company,” wrote an Activision Blizzard spokesperson. The company declined to comment further. Meschuk appears to have deleted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jesse_meschuk?lang=en"&gt;his Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISKyfO"&gt;While Brack oversaw the entire Blizzard brand and was named in the state of California’s lawsuit as an alleged enabler, Blizzard’s human resources department was also allegedly complicit. The lawsuit suggested that employees were “discouraged from complaining as human resource personnel were known to be close to alleged harassers,” and one of the people pictured in photographs of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598508/activision-blizzard-cosby-suite-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;the “Cosby Suite”&lt;/a&gt; was allegedly an HR employee, according to an ex-Blizzard developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CQSdjC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“suck it up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOswJY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/activision-blizzard-harassment-lawsuit-hr-da4f678a-510c-4975-9d64-f5d744aa5c02.html"&gt;In an report published by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; today&lt;/a&gt;, multiple current and former Blizzard employees called the company’s human resources team part of the problem. They would report issues only to be ignored, belittled, and retaliated against, they claimed. An HR rep reportedly told one employee to “suck it up” because they were “acting like a brat.” Another told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; that after she was assaulted by a male colleague, the HR rep took his side, telling her to work from home or switch departments. “He’s really sorry and he really wants to work at Blizzard. And he says that you were really friendly with him,” they reportedly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ozdwex"&gt;Last Tuesday, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick promised to clean house, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;writing that &lt;/a&gt;“Anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ttNtw"&gt;On Activision Blizzard’s earnings call Tuesday, Kotick defended the company’s intent to make necessary changes. “I want to start by making clear to everyone that there’s no place at our company where discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind will be tolerated. Nowhere,” he said, adding that “we will be the company that sets the example for this in our industry.” He also continued to suggest, however, that the allegations were old news. “Over the past several years we’ve made significant changes to address company culture,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaot8m"&gt;“When we come together, we make some of the best games in the industry, and we’re now seeing that energy applied to our culture, which is equally important,” Jen Oneal, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;who was made one of Blizzard’s new co-leads on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, said later on the call. “There’s a lot of work ahead of us, but the passion and productivity are already here. When our people feel safe and supported, the rest is going to take care of itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel leak reveals Thunderbolt 5 could offer 80Gbps USB-C ports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWYPJjE5pEJvoVU_IBmXBtnroU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69674234/akrales_190522_3440_0067.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5EglY8"&gt;Thunderbolt 4 is still relatively early on, but that isn’t stopping Intel from working on its next version of the connectivity standard, Thunderbolt 5. And thanks to a hastily deleted tweet from Intel executive Gregory Bryant &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16858/intel-executive-posts-thunderbolt-5-photo-80-gbps-and-pam3-then-deletes-it?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow"&gt;that was caught by &lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve already gotten a sneak preview at the next-generation Thunderbolt standard, which could offer twice the speed of Thunderbolt 4 while maintaining physical USB-C plugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqRUjl"&gt;The most notable thing on the post was a title for “80G PHY Technology” — referencing a  physical connector that offers 80Gbps connections, which would be twice the speeds offered by Thunderbolt 4 (which maxes out at 40Gbps).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1o5PxyjQIeMhbYp2d4ETWOZ4vw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759378/Q293.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16858/intel-executive-posts-thunderbolt-5-photo-80-gbps-and-pam3-then-deletes-it?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XlmwBr"&gt;The next line confirms that the new technology still plans to use USB-C plugs (“USB 80G is targeted to support the existing USB-C ecosystem,” which is extremely good news for anyone who’s already heavily invested in USB-C connectivity. Cables, hubs, and devices will still have to be replaced with ones that specifically support Thunderbolt 5 (or whatever Intel names it) when it’s released — but it means that we’re in for at least one more generation of stable, backwards compatible plugs with which all your existing chargers, drives, and dongles will still work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg3uYW"&gt;The last major factor revealed by the accidentally published poster is that the next-gen connectivity tech will use “PAM-3 modulation technology,” which, &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16858/intel-executive-posts-thunderbolt-5-photo-80-gbps-and-pam3-then-deletes-it?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;, is a new method of transmitting bits along the cable that allows for higher bandwidth than current methods. (I’d highly recommend reading the far more technical explanation there if you’re interested in the details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bxy4p"&gt;We’re still likely months, if not years, away from Thunderbolt 5 hitting the market; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21317513/intel-thunderbolt-4-standard-docks-cables-usb4-accessories-port-usbc"&gt;Thunderbolt 4 is only about a year old&lt;/a&gt;, for starters, and there’s still plenty of work left to do to continue to roll out the existing standard. Still, it’s an interesting sneak peak at what the future of connectivity will look like, even if it’ll be a while before you can actually use it. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Amazon Prime Day, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $25, and while it’s currently not available at that price, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have temporarily discounted it to $45. There is also a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other info that is available for $60, the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the Kids Edition is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers for $5 off, bringing the price down to $55. Amazon is also selling a discounted bundle for $75, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Amazon does &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M1MRHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offer a $100 bundle that includes a free Ring Smart Bulb&lt;/a&gt;, though, and Target is currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal/-/A-80770246/&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22362455%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $20 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $180. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3g4zTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2-megapixel camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The second-gen model is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08KJN3333/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740550908332818656" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $85, however, you can also pick up the last-gen model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa-charcoal%2F-%2FA-76526131%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000012807845%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Local%257CElectronics_Ecomm_Hardlines%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9061079%26targetid%3Dpla-990594042919%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwo4mIBhBsEiwAKgzXOLrJxn1_3VD1UR7wtcFcAcvw397zeAm5Hp9bimjK6d6Phv9g3whA2xoCMfYQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747625078603978178#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $45, its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently only available for $110 — its full retail price — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08J8FFJ8H_toAsin_B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742759409782754841#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fthis-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1082904/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen/-/A-83387876&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/this-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $130. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle that contains a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blink Mini for $140&lt;/a&gt; or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Target is also &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeSmartDisplaysforHome061621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering $100 off a pair of Echo Show 10s&lt;/a&gt; at checkout through August 28th, bringing the price of two down to $400.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYC’s Key vaccination requirement for indoor dining can be met with an app</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZthONz"&gt;Today, NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2pmlJ6WY26k?t=448"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; details of the “Key to NYC Pass,” a plan to require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 before entering locations like fitness centers, restaurants, or entertainment venues. New Yorkers can meet those requirements by carrying their vaccination card or scanning and storing it in one of two authorized mobile apps. While some businesses and events have already begun to require proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID test for entry by workers and customers, government-mandated “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356333/covid-vaccine-certification-passport-biden"&gt;vaccine passports&lt;/a&gt;” have been a controversial topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MsJXe4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Soon you will not be able to go inside a restaurant, inside a gym, or inside a concert or performance in New York City without proof of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. Join us now for more info. &lt;a href="https://t.co/oVKhBC3Ptr"&gt;https://t.co/oVKhBC3Ptr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NYC Mayor's Office (@NYCMayorsOffice) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayorsOffice/status/1422563052168286210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t0F3ql"&gt;The spread of the highly contagious Delta variant is being cited as a reason to increase restrictions without returning to a full lockdown or other measures. The program is scheduled to launch on August 13th, with enforcement slated to start on September 13th. It doesn’t introduce any new documentation; the name is a reference to it serving as a “key” to the city’s recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsE9FO"&gt;Workers and patrons can confirm their vaccination status (at least one dose administered) in one of three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JptXVK"&gt;Vaccination card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeHPgJ"&gt;NYC COVID Safe exposure notification app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyc-covid-safe/id1565213506"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nyc.doitt.covidsafe&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jGg6AI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass"&gt;NYS Excelsior Pass app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="f1hfzv"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nyc-require-proof-vaccination-indoor-activities-mayor-2021-08-03/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mentions, NYC has already begun several other initiatives to get people vaccinated, including a mandate for city employees (or else face weekly testing) and a $100 incentive for the public. NYC data shows about 60 percent of residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
