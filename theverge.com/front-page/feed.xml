    <title>FCC’s net neutrality rollback overwhelmed by bogus industry comments, investigation finds</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYHvRZ"&gt;The New York attorney general’s office &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag-fakecommentsreport.pdf"&gt;issued a report Thursday&lt;/a&gt; confirming that some of the US’s largest broadband providers engaged in a massive campaign to flood the Federal Communications Commission with fake comments in the run-up to the commission’s 2017 order to roll back net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZBrUr"&gt;The attorney general’s multi-year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16686644/eric-schneiderman-fcc-net-neutrality-spam-investigation-evidence"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found that fake comments accounted for the vast majority of comments received in response to the order — nearly 18 million, out of a total of 22 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GziA1v"&gt;The comments were submitted through a process called “co-registration,” which saw outside companies promising “gift cards and sweepstakes entries” in order to attract consumers to join in the campaign. They would then use that information to file form responses to the order, even as the people behind the comments had no idea their names had been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iT0dTD"&gt;According to the report, many of these companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15610744/anti-net-neutrality-fake-comments-identities"&gt;filed fake consumer responses&lt;/a&gt; as well. More than half a million fake letters to Congress were also fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AyfVK"&gt;The attorney general’s office found that the largest groups funding this influence campaign were three of the largest telecom companies in the US, together with an industry trade group. All told, the parties represented more than 65 million subscribers and a combined market value of half a trillion dollars.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zB7r1"&gt;The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQhDRt"&gt;“Americans’ voices are being drowned out by masses of fake comments and messages being submitted to the government to sway decision-making,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-issues-report-detailing-millions-fake-comments-revealing"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. “Instead of actually looking for real responses from the American people, marketing companies are luring vulnerable individuals to their websites with freebies, co-opting their identities, and fabricating responses that giant corporations are then using to influence the policies and laws that govern our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruwBSg"&gt;The three main companies found to have falsely influenced the FCC’s rollback — Fluent, React2Media, and Opt-Intelligence — entered into settlements with the attorney general’s office, requiring the companies to pay over $4 million in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT6nip"&gt;The attorney general’s office also found 9.3 million fake comments were sent to the FCC in support of net neutrality using false identities. “Most of these comments were submitted by a single person — a 19-year-old college student using automated software,” James said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5dnfr"&gt;Concerns were raised about automated commenting during the comment period, with a number of media outlets reporting on comments filed either by dead people or people who had no recollection of filing a comment. The New York attorney general’s office began investigating the claims &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990758/net-neutrality-fcc-new-york-attorney-general-investigation"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a month before the FCC was set to vote to repeal the Obama-era net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft would like to remind you the Xbox definitely makes money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbrUG6gAiTeugzAcK4eE2EsejnE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245901/vpavic_4275_20201030_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OokXO"&gt;A Microsoft executive has admitted that the company doesn’t earn any profit on sales of Xbox consoles alone. The admission came as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial yesterday, confirming what we’ve known for years: Microsoft sells Xbox consoles at a loss. Asked how much margin Microsoft makes on Xbox consoles, the company’s head of Xbox business development, Lori Wright, said, “We don’t; we sell the consoles at a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuDVqw"&gt;An Epic Games lawyer asked a follow-up question: “Does Microsoft ever earn a profit on the sale of an Xbox console?” Wright replied, “No.” That doesn’t mean Xbox doesn’t make money, though. Microsoft was keen to point this out in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; just hours after Wright’s testimony yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVnfkQ"&gt;“The gaming business is a profitable and high-growth business for Microsoft,” says a Microsoft spokesperson. “The console gaming business is traditionally a hardware subsidy model. Game companies sell consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are generated in game sales and online service subscriptions.“&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FEUW7o0SLmMH0yrqGsPtZ6aOk0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22013076/vpavic_201103_4275_0252.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Series S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NFgB6W"&gt;I asked Microsoft whether it never truly makes any margins on hardware alone, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication. Typically, Microsoft and Sony subsidize hardware at the beginning of a console’s lifecycle, but those early component costs tend to decrease over time. Those lower costs also translate to lower retail prices for consoles over time, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VhHN5"&gt;A teardown analysis of the Xbox One S, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160805005103/en/IHS-Markit-Teardown-Analysis-Microsoft%E2%80%99s-Xbox-One-S-Brings-Significant-Value-Gains-with-Minimal-Commercial-Pain"&gt;revealed an estimated bill of materials&lt;/a&gt; of $324, which is $75 less than the $399 launch price for the 2TB version of the console, back in 2016. Microsoft also launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18309223/microsoft-xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition-price-release-date"&gt;disc-less version of the Xbox One S&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, which was presumably also sold at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjHqYY"&gt;Sony and Microsoft have similar business models for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, but Nintendo is the exception. In court documents, Microsoft estimates that hardware is generating a loss for Sony, but a profit for Nintendo. That’s backed up by Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;impressive 84.59 million Switch sales&lt;/a&gt; this year, up to March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eKIlqX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Epic v. Apple turns into Windows v. Xbox","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"},{"title":"Microsoft’s app store changes crank up the Apple pressure","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"},{"title":"Microsoft explored reducing its Xbox store cut to shake up console gaming ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415712/microsoft-xbox-store-cut-epic-games-court-documents"},{"title":"Microsoft shakes up PC gaming by reducing Windows store cut to just 12 percent ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OU3w5X"&gt;Why all these costs are being discussed right now is a big part of the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. Epic isn’t happy about Apple’s 30 percent revenue cut on in-app purchases for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Apple is arguing that Epic should also take issue with Microsoft or Sony’s identical 30 percent cut. It has resulted in hours of testimony about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;whether the iPhone is more like a PC or an Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and a debate around open platforms versus locked-down ones. Microsoft clearly sees a difference between Xbox and PC, and has only cut the amount it takes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;on the Windows side to 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;, while the Xbox remains at 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CHG6Y"&gt;Microsoft obviously wants to maintain its business model for Xbox, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes"&gt;attempted to push&lt;/a&gt; the industry toward digital games for years. Microsoft has very much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;sided with Epic Games in the case against Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic has admitted it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;never even questioned&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s digital sales cut. But how long this harmony will exist between the pair will very much depend on the future of digital game sales and cloud gaming. Microsoft is increasingly focused on its Xbox Game Pass subscription, which spans across devices that aren’t even Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCjUkY"&gt;Game Pass also includes xCloud, Microsoft’s cloud gaming technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;isn’t part of xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, because Epic Games won’t allow it. That highlights the emerging battles that are starting to take place in the game industry over shares of revenue. It looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415712/microsoft-xbox-store-cut-epic-games-court-documents"&gt;Microsoft has been preparing&lt;/a&gt; for some of them, but &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; feels like the beginning of a greater war over the digital future of game stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The final trailer for A Quiet Place Part II drops over a year after I thought it came out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwJNCs0EL9X7zDY_EPip8t2htI8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245877/a_quiet_place_part_ii_AQP2_03710R_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Jonny Cournoyer / Paramount Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afYANt"&gt;Over a year after &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; was set to release, Paramount has dropped the final trailer for it. It looks pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08vobL"&gt;Paramount made the decision to pull the movie from the schedule back in March 2020 due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176712/a-quiet-place-part-2-delay-paramount-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;concerns over the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, director and star of the first film &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnkrasinski/status/1238115296017371137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1238115296017371137%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F3%2F12%2F21176712%2Fa-quiet-place-part-2-delay-paramount-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;John Krasinski tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he was proud of it, but felt it needed to be seen in a theater for true impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5sOyy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpdDN9d9Jio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Js27R9"&gt;The problem was Paramount had already blown its marketing budget for the movie when it was pulled from the release schedule. The world premiere was held in New York on March 8th, 2020. Critics saw it and many published glowing first reactions to it. Plenty of my friends saw it in early screenings and told me it was great. Emily Blunt appeared on talk shows hyping it. Billboards and murals went up all over the country with a big March 20th, 2020 release date plastered on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNOGFu"&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;’s release was pulled and, at least in my neighborhood, no one rented the billboards and murals after the release date came and went. Ten-foot tall images of a beleaguered Emily Blunt and her kids making their way through an abandoned city lingered for months in my partially abandoned New York neighborhood. Every day I’d walk my dog on empty streets, and pass by them — weird time capsules of the before time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCilbR"&gt;And I guess I just forgot the film never actually came out. Until today’s final trailer dropped, I just assumed it had come out, and everyone but me saw it, and then Paramount just didn’t put it on Paramount+ for reasons known only to Paramount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqTCDp"&gt;But with millions of Americans vaccinated, and theaters slowly moving toward reopening, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; is finally getting its big release. If you are like me and had assumed it already came out, you can now look forward to May 28th, 2021, when it really will, for totally real this time, be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9EMWc"&gt;And if you’re wary of actually going to a theater, given an alarming number of Americans are unvaccinated for a wide variety of reasons, and you’d prefer to watch it at home as we’ve all learned to consume our big-budget flicks, then good news! Paramount has confirmed &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; will be on Paramount+ 45 days after it premieres in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iainRg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus Watch gets an always-on display — at the cost of half its battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Piqc2cn4rbtJfTTv3Xqksy4ApRo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245840/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HHoNyQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-watch-software-update-b-48-change-log.1431439/"&gt;OnePlus has released its latest update&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;OnePlus Watch&lt;/a&gt;, adding its promised always-on display mode that was absent on the device when it first launched in April. But being able to always see the time on OnePlus’ smartwatch comes at a big cost, with the company cautioning that the new mode will halve the expected battery life when using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L4Nvx6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Watch review: big, basic, and boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5UeCtn"&gt;The release of the always-on display was surprisingly swift for OnePlus, which announced that it planned to add the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395791/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-always-on-display-update"&gt;just two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. The company says in a blog post that the B.48 update that adds the new feature will arrive for a “small percentage” of users first, with wider rollout over the coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idjpPy"&gt;In addition to enabling the always-on display, the B.48 update also adds the option to use the OnePlus Watch as a remote camera button, a new “Marathon” workout mode, and other improvements, optimizations, and bug fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZZ46m"&gt;While the new always-on display option does fix one of the OnePlus Watch’s glaring absences, the fact that it comes with such a big hit in battery life makes it a tougher trade-off for users (especially given that battery life was one of the watch’s highlights.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkBZVO"&gt;The full OnePlus Watch B.48 update changelog is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OBpZXI"&gt;Add Always-on Display dial*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnSjVO"&gt;Remote Control Camera function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zp0ihA"&gt;Add Marathon workout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FBhkg"&gt;Improvements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3KGgf"&gt;Optimize system UI details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsIhXq"&gt;Fix known issues and improve system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YG0m6P"&gt;*After Always-on Display dial is turned on, the screen remains constantly on. This will lead to increased power consumption. Battery life will be reduced by about half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>This could be your last chance to order gifts that’ll arrive by Mother’s Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HRCzbE"&gt;Mother’s Day is Sunday, May 9th. You knew that though. That’s why you already got Mom a gift. Nice going... Wait, you haven’t done that yet? Today is likely the cut-off date for guaranteeing that orders placed online will get where they need to be by Sunday (you may have luck tomorrow, but I wouldn’t push it, personally). So, without further delay, let’s load you up with a few last-minute ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPaTg3"&gt;Firstly, our team has already compiled a big, varied list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;Mother’s Day gift ideas right here&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The art of making simple but tough rhythm games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3QIFgE4o3RFy5suJarM8UhNyRM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245754/ss_7dc2c278e2c6c2346c8f1a9a0ec30ddfc3d502ca.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: D-Cell Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Unbeatable and Rhythm Doctor make the genre more accessible — and challenging&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="seA3kE"&gt;From the trailer’s opening, with its striking, pastel-colored anime visuals, loud rock guitar riffs, and energetic vocals, &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dcellgames/unbeatable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;looks and sounds &lt;em&gt;incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyn7DE"&gt;Wrapped in turn-of-the-millennium influences in both its anime and rock aesthetic, it looks like a game from the Dreamcast era, with its tagline calling it “a game where music is illegal and you do crimes” recalling the youthful rebellious spirit of &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt;. But as the trailer for its successful Kickstarter shows, it’s also part of a new wave of indie rhythm games, alongside early access title &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/774181/Rhythm_Doctor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where accessibility is at the forefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLu0Pj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; may have aesthetics inspired by Japanese rhythm games, where in the arcades they are known either for peripherals or for demanding intimidating dextrous feats, but its inputs are much simpler. As pink-haired protagonist Beat, players use just two buttons to hit oncoming enemies and objects much like notes approaching on top and bottom lanes from either the left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwbgBN"&gt;The format, which had one fan dubbing it “street-style Taiko,” went through some iteration since the project first materialized with a public demo at 2019’s MAGFest, as the developer D-Cell Games explained to me over Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIkyrB"&gt;“That version was four buttons, and what we actually found was, ironically, that made the game too easy for the people who were really into rhythm games but too hard for anyone who was coming in new,” explains RJ Lake, &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s writer and music supervisor. “Cutting it to two buttons made it way more approachable if you have no idea what a rhythm game is or how rhythm games are supposed to play. But then because there’s only two buttons to pay attention to, we can throw a lot more at the player without them feeling overwhelmed, which means our songs can be mapped in a much more complex way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="oRajVw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-xFczhoZb8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nb8Uvt"&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s songs are played to note charts typical of the genre, the team actually took their cue from action games, which can be seen with how the buttons correspond to the visuals as Beat attacks, dodges, or combos different notes. “We wanted to draft a rhythm system that felt like playing an action combat game akin to a PlatinumGames title,” says Jeffrey Chiao, the game’s producer and level designer. “I think what was the initial accepted draft that we built with was something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;One Finger Death Punch&lt;/em&gt;, which is not actually a rhythm game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWpTFG"&gt;That approach has, incidentally, thrown some players for a loop. Instead of just watching oncoming notes to hit on cue, you might also be avoiding others by hitting the opposite button, while more devious are blue notes that need a 1-2 combo follow-up. While the team is aware of the feedback and aims to balance it, those elements are still very much intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8tbQY"&gt;“The blue note design is a pretty good example of trying to hit in that action, where the down and up is kind of like in &lt;em&gt;Devil May Cry&lt;/em&gt; when you do a launcher and then juggle the enemy that’s thrown up in the air,” adds Chiao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xOViY9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For me, rhythm games are also much more of a casual thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHEIwH"&gt;The team is only too aware of the ridiculously high level of play certain rhythm aficionados can reach, but ultimately accessibility has been an important priority. “I loved &lt;em&gt;Elite Beat Agents&lt;/em&gt; and crushed that game in one sitting when it came out,” says Lake. “But for me, rhythm games are also much more of a casual thing. When I’m working on the project, a thing I try to focus on is making sure that people who aren’t going to sit down and endlessly play the same song to full-combo perfection, but want to come in and just enjoy music in an interactive way, will still be invested in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lre7OP"&gt;Some accessibility options are already apparent in the demo, such as reducing the visual clutter with various toggles (the aim is for more granular customization for the final product) and even an option to lose the game’s intentionally fuzzy filter, which gives it the vibe of a long-lost bootleg VHS recording of a cult anime. “There’s nothing harder in the world at this point, we’ve realized, than trying to make a game that everyone will like,” says Lake. “But at the very least, we’d like to settle for a game that everyone can play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYks7udaAa0sK4ujM7jmSm5AH3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489115/ss_ec7ff92bacd37cf1242079931cf0ad7a1a1aadc2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1TcoLu"&gt;Preceding &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable,&lt;/em&gt; however, is &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;, which is arguably even more accessible, as it’s all limited to just one button. This mimics your role as a remote medical intern tasked with hitting a defibrillator to treat patients with strange ailments. But anyone who’s played it will also know that the simple premise of smacking the space bar at the seventh beat of a tune is more devilishly difficult than it lets on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNPp4r"&gt;Development has been far from straightforward. The project has been going on for almost a decade; it first started as a college summer project that resulted in a Flash demo. The one-button design was in part due to developer Hafiz Azman’s dislike of the multi-button dexterity demanded by most rhythm games. “After the first few levels were released as a Flash demo, it became a kind of challenge to myself to see how far I could go without ever introducing a second button,” he tells me over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30Viow"&gt;Part of why &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt; has taken so long to make is also the challenge of keeping within those constraints, where in some cases a boss level might have taken hundreds of hours to iterate and perfect. “There’s tons of concepts and even full levels that we threw away, a lot of times it’s because the level isn’t delightful or surprising enough,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PHQuc0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It gets difficult to squeeze out the surprise from a simple mechanic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nsZoiY"&gt;“It gets difficult to squeeze out the surprise from a simple mechanic, but I think that struggle is also necessary. I read somewhere that the writing team behind &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; held to that principle of writing without looking ahead too much — they’d write themselves into a corner that they had no idea how to get their characters out of, and then sit in the writing room and struggle until they figured out something. The end result would be surprising to them, and as a result, surprising to the viewers too. I guess we ended up following that philosophy by sticking so adamantly to our constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1R25i"&gt;Another reason for sticking to the one-button mechanic was because &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt; was designed to be “blind-friendly,” which in theory meant that visuals mattered less. Of course, part of the game’s delight and deviousness is down to its deliberately distortive and distracting visuals designed to throw players off. Indeed, you might have an easier time by shutting your eyes and just focusing on listening to the beat in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jc0rkw"&gt;“We actually needed to put extra effort in the visuals because, if the visuals are technically redundant, that means we have a lot more flexibility to do anything we want with it, so our ceiling of what to achieve is higher if we want to use everything we could potentially do,” explains Azman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVn5y7"&gt;It’s the simplicity of the design that then allows for more complex layers to be built on top of it, such as the night modes that provide an alternative version of a song with a more difficult twist. “For example, the first level in the game is about counting to seven only with no other mechanics. So for the night shift version, I settled on using dubstep because that genre tends to have bass sounds that change rhythms quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="9jt84B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BaF2YFhLaok?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OEzrFh"&gt;Arguably, being able to prove these concepts in early stages, whether it’s a demo or early access, has been key to the successful reception these games have so far gotten. Meanwhile, D-Cell Games has already gone above and beyond by not only dropping an “arcade mix” &lt;a href="https://dcellgames.itch.io/unbeatable-arcade-mix"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; at the start of &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt;’s Kickstarter campaign, but also following it up with a “white label” demo that tells a side story showcasing the game’s narrative adventure elements (although at time of writing, this hasn’t yet been made available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kLpL4"&gt;Granted, &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; actually achieved its $55,000 funding goal before the demo had even gone live, but its success is a stark contrast to the crowdfunding misfortunes of rhythm game &lt;em&gt;Project Rap Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; a few years ago. Even a project with the combined talents of legendary rhythm studios NanaOn-Sha (&lt;em&gt;PaRappa the Rapper&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vib-Ribbon&lt;/em&gt;) and iNiS (&lt;em&gt;Gitaroo Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Elite Beat Agents&lt;/em&gt;) couldn’t get funded. While that could be down to the much higher funding goal (its final pledges actually amounted to slightly more than what &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; currently has), it also suffered from failing to present actual gameplay footage that could communicate what kind of rhythm game it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cz05z"&gt;“Messaging is so, so important when you launch your Kickstarter,” says Lake. “If you do not have any external aesthetic sense, and you’re not hiring people or working with people who have the ability to make a project really shine in someone else’s eyes, you’re not going to have people want to even look at it to begin with. It’s so important to present the project well and make sure people aren’t confused or have any of those lingering questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijuvHW"&gt;Azman mentions that early in development, he was actually approached by indie publisher Humble based on &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;’s Flash demo, although nothing came of it. “They went silent for weeks, but got back to us saying they couldn’t get anyone else in the team to see how a single-button mechanic where you just press space on the seventh beat could ever support a full game,” he says. “It was clear people much more experienced than us thought it wasn’t wise to stick to a constraint, but we did it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoFt4h"&gt;Rhythm has always been integral in games, whether showing up as a mini-game or as an underlying mechanic to something as hardcore and mainstream as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animturnbull/status/1116028893125677057?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Another recent trend has been to explicitly mash rhythm up with other genres as a hybrid, such as dungeon-crawling roguelike &lt;em&gt;Crypt of the NecroDancer&lt;/em&gt; or first-person shooter &lt;em&gt;BPM: Bullets Per Minute&lt;/em&gt;, although Azman is less interested by these: “It’s a personal preference, but adding rhythm to an existing genre feels like it inhibits the freedom that was there before, rather than adding something exciting to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MOS0np"&gt;But with both &lt;em&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhythm Doctor&lt;/em&gt;, it’s an exciting time for the genre to go back to basics, finding the joy of rhythm in its pure, distilled form. As Lake puts it, “We want to bring more types of people to get the basic joy of pressing buttons in response to a beat. There’s something just gut-level brain-tingling about doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4’s latest teaser is a glimpse of Eleven’s dark past</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stranger Things 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZrEWuS4ebQ_JfXfUH9N_XMV0c4=/302x0:2090x1192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245554/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.08.12_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGwIZU"&gt;It’s been a long time since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891537/stranger-things-netflix-renewed-season-four-hawkins-duffer-brothers-deal-tv"&gt;Netflix first announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;— the upcoming fourth season of the streamer’s hugely popular series — but there’s finally a new trailer teasing the next adventures of the Hawkins gang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LlEkwc"&gt;The new teaser appears to be a flashback, showing the sinister Dr. Martin Brenner addressing a group of children at the same facility that Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) originated from. Presumably, the new season will continue to explore Eleven’s origins, as well as potentially introduce other supernatural children (something the show has explored before back in season 2.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FI1yE1"&gt;The new trailer is technically the second for the upcoming fourth season, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;following a teaser released back in February 2020&lt;/a&gt; that promised the return of the — spoilers for season 3 — presumably dead (in an extradimensional portal explosion) Chief Jim Hopper, played by David Harbour. Based on the captions of the two videos (001/004 and 002/004, respectively), it seems that fans should expect two more teasers on the way at some point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHOZg9"&gt;The lengthy amount of time between that last teaser and today’s new trailer is because Netflix was only able to get in two weeks of filming at the beginning of 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; work on the series only resumed last September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drcJLW"&gt;Netflix has yet to announce a release date for the fourth season, but presumably, with the marketing campaign ramping up again, it won’t be too far off before &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; debuts. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKd53X"&gt;Owners of Apple’s HomePod and HomePod mini can now connect their smart speakers directly to Deezer and make the music streaming service their default player. That means they can take advantage of the HomePod’s Siri voice controls to navigate their tunes and playlists on Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJnhri"&gt;To connect the services, you’ll first need to be a paying Deezer subscriber. If you are, head to the Deezer app on your iOS device (make sure you’re on iOS 14.3 or later), hit the settings cog in the top right, then scroll down and hit “Connect with HomePod.” You can then play music from Deezer on your Apple speakers by saying “Hey Siri, play [insert cool and relevant band of choice] on Deezer&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u5PDD0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s smart speakers now work directly with Deezer, but still no Spotify&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5oidUz"&gt;Alternatively,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you can make Deezer your default player from Apple’s Home app and avoid having to specify which streaming service to use. We weren’t able to test this ourselves, but it’s likely the same process as for other third-party streaming services. So go to Home Settings by hitting the house icon in the top left of Apple’s Home app, tap on your face under the “People” section,” then go to “Default Service” and choose Deezer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzwbri"&gt;Phew. Isn’t it fantastic when these services &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AShI0p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple HomePod mini review: playing small ball","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="c3dlfx"&gt;Of course, the struggle to offer these sorts of basic, third-party integrations is exactly what’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;hurt&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s smart speakers, likely contributing to the company’s decision to discontinue the original HomePod in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;March this year&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the reasonably-priced and good-sounding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt; still soldiers on. In addition to Deezer, these devices can now directly integrate with other streaming services including Apple Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and Pandora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuR9VH"&gt;What’s missing from this list, of course, is Spotify. Although Apple says it’s enabled integration with the music streaming giant, as far as we know Spotify hasn’t switched things on at its end. If you’re searching for an explanation, look no further than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;huge lawsuit Spotify is currently pursuing against Apple&lt;/a&gt;. As an alternative, you can use Spotify to play music on HomePod speakers, but you’ll need to connect via AirPlay, which is frustratingly slow and lacks voice controls — one of the big draws of using a smart speaker at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82dyym"&gt;But hey, that’s what you, the unlucky consumer, get for being stuck between two warring corporations. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to hide apps from your iPhone’s home screen using iOS 14</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7MsKC4IL9WCnMxho9Z8yeE3GYPU=/0x0:3441x2294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245433/iphone-games-004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9tHJL"&gt;If you get annoyed with the number of apps that crowd your iPhone’s home screen, you probably welcomed a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21291695/apple-ios-14-updates-home-screen-redesign-features-release-date-wwdc-2020"&gt;came with iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;: the App Library, which gathers all of your apps into various categories and displays them on a separate page to the right of your home pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9dNBXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14’s App Library to organize your apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pt9K1X"&gt;The App Library doesn’t only add some automatic organization to your iPhone’s home pages, but allows you to clean up your home screen by hiding as many apps as you want. You can keep your favorites front and center, and get the more utilitarian or less-used apps out of the way. (In fact, one way to keep a clean screen is to have all your newly-installed apps appear in your App Library only — we offer directions on how to do that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21443994/ios-14-app-library-iphone-organize-how-to"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQvLxm"&gt;If you want to organize your current apps by hiding some of them, there are several ways to do it. You can remove individual apps from the home screen, you can hide an entire screen of apps, or you can organize several apps by putting them into a folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwz9rr"&gt;Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vjeqk2"&gt;Hide a single app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoswT8gw8DQFQzcLTVfk_jITo7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494263/IMG_6FDA0D8317B4_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on an app and select “Remove App”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Remove from Home Screen”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkFpNCzdZ1YD4yxdcVDXS2ZDXC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494261/IMG_0106.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Remove from Home Screen”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3fNxy"&gt;To hide individual apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCkcpw"&gt;Press on your selected app until a menu appears. The menu will include a number of options, depending on the app’s features (for example, if I press on an app for Microsoft Teams, the menu will let me make a new call or start a chat). But you will always get an option (in red) to remove the app. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dYLK3y"&gt;You will now have the choice of deleting the app from the phone or removing it from the home screen. Select the latter. You’ll still find the app in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1tHXdP"&gt;If the app is not already in the App Library, then after you tap “Remove App,” you will instead be given the choice of either deleting the app or moving it to the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hNL7OI"&gt;Hide a page of apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYpm-d8akSfLGxkJjGFbz-bQHe4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494282/IMG_70E40F5ECAB6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press the screen and tap the series of dots at the bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Uncheck the screen that you want to hide" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pldHVJRMw7Ti3jEUwGSO5odrScc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494275/IMG_8FD48CFB7F74_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncheck the screen that you want to hide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rALNn7"&gt;You can also hide an entire page of apps — and get rid of that page — at one blow if you want. And since it’s really easy to also restore that same page, it’s a great way to hide groups of apps that you only use occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v4tT06"&gt;Tap and hold on an empty part of your screen until the apps begin to jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XKAP6x"&gt;Tap on the dots at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZQPXkm"&gt;You’ll now be able to see small versions of all your screens (except the App Library and Today View). Beneath each visible screen is a checkmark; uncheck any screen you want to hide and tap “Done” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wXDkoH"&gt;To “unhide” any of the screens, follow these same directions and replace the checkmark of the screen that you want to see again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P0gvzg"&gt;Use folders to organize apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIpIBK9-M5LOQWtd7jjCpYtCNps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494310/IMG_F1C450C97344_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move one app on top of another to create a gray folder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4GXqYO_GOuozrOkz0QtaYgPcgwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494266/IMG_0D571D5779F9_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open the folder to access the apps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SK6n99"&gt;You can use folders on the home screen to gather similar apps together and save space. You won’t be completely hiding the apps — they’ll be there. But they’ll be consolidated in a single space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPxg35"&gt;It’s very simple to create a folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="626Ixd"&gt;Long-press on an app in the home screen until the icons jiggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dMfIlH"&gt;Move the app onto one of the other apps you want to group it with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ufgkAJ"&gt;You’ll now have a gray icon that contains the icons for the apps in the folder. Tap on the icon to open the folder and access the apps in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f6j7NI"&gt;iOS will assign a name to the folder depending on what apps you’ve put in it. To change the name, long-press on the folder, and select “Rename” from the pop-up menu. Then type in the new name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Open the folder to access the apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pq0N0qhP4_upKkheuMYVu92wt1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494270/IMG_0C514D9DDEC0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the folder to rename or remove it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can rename it anything you like" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1skcDiJqHcDYYlA5oUP-CjpD8O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494272/IMG_B98F55477CAA_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can rename it anything you like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Fcht3h"&gt;To remove an app from a folder, simply open the folder, long-press the app until it jiggles, and move it out of the folder and to another space on your home screen. If you remove all the apps from a folder, the folder will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="el18TB"&gt;If you want to get rid of a folder, you can also long-press on it and select “Remove Folder.” Any apps that were in the folder can then be found in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UT4l6g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxDiB3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egtIJp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNNBa0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bwkyff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus Zenfone 8 Flip leak pairs flipping cameras with Snapdragon 888</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCi4BG0vVvAlij763OVfUNK4bEs=/0x0:1296x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245135/asus_zenfone_8_flip_image_feat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8 Flip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IDv02h"&gt;Asus’s successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21400709/asus-zenfone-7-flipping-triple-camera-zoom-ultrawide-battery-90hz-oled-display"&gt;last year’s Zenfone 7&lt;/a&gt; has leaked online, pointing to a return for the phones’ flipping camera array on May 12th. Specs and images of two upcoming devices — the Zenfone 8 and Zenfone 8 Flip — have been &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on information provided by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354"&gt;leaker Ishan Agarwal&lt;/a&gt;. As its name suggests, the 8 Flip has three cameras built into a mechanical flipping mechanism that rotates them over the top edge of the display to take selfies, while the 8 has two rear cameras in a more standard rectangular camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV8F8G"&gt;From the leaks, the Zenfone 8 Flip appears to be a comparatively minor spec bump compared to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408307/asus-zenfone-7-pro-review"&gt;Zenfone 7 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got a Snapdragon 888 processor rather than a Snapdragon 865 Plus, but the new model has the same massive 5,000mAH battery, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. The 1080p OLED display is still notchless thanks to the flipping cameras, still 6.67 inches in size, and still 90Hz, according to the leak. It also reportedly weighs the same at 230 grams, which could mean another heavy device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Ffrdn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Full Specs &amp;amp; Renders of the ASUS Zenfone 8 &amp;amp; Zenfone 8 Flip, launching on May 12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zenfone 8 is a compact smartphone with 5.92" screen size while th 8 Flip has a 6.67" AMOLED Display.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both feature Snapdragon 888 &amp;amp; 64MP Main Camera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please link &amp;amp; credit: &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk"&gt;https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/MCc2p5ISaK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MCc2p5ISaK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ishan Agarwal (@ishanagarwal24) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rn2rP"&gt;The cameras also appear similar, with one key difference. While last year’s Zenfone 7 Pro had a 64 megapixel main camera paired with a 8 megapixel telephoto and 12 megapixel ultrawide, the new 8 Flip will apparently swap out the ultrawide for a 12 megapixel macro. We generally find ultrawide cameras much more useful than macro cameras on phones, making this an unfortunate change if accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pocxci1AUQaLgnCeFnRDlvumiys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495517/asus_zenfone_8_render_01_1068x1066.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aOE2WZ"&gt;Meanwhile, the standard Zenfone 8 is a much more traditional device, according to the leak. It’ll apparently have a smaller 5.92-inch 1080p display, but internally there’s the same Snapdragon 888 processor, and 8GB of RAM, albeit with a smaller 4,000 mAh battery and 128GB of internal storage. It’ll also reportedly come with one less rear-facing camera since it lacks the telephoto of the 8 Flip. That said, it should have the same number of cameras overall thanks to its separate hole-punch selfie camera on the front. It’s also fitted with an increasingly rare headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzXUYu"&gt;No details were given on the phones’ pricing or release dates, but with a launch event reportedly coming next week, we won’t have long to wait for official information.&lt;/p&gt;
