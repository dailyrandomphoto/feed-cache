    <title>Amazon is opening its first manufacturing line in India to produce Fire TV devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OPAgJE"&gt;Amazon is opening its first manufacturing line in India in a partnership with Foxconn-owned Cloud Network Technology, an India-based subsidiary of the Taiwanese electronics giant, &lt;a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.in/our-business/amazon-announces-first-device-manufacturing-line-in-india"&gt;Amazon announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership is part of an effort to work with the Indian government, which has embarked on a campaign to encourage companies to invest in the Indian economy to avoid roadblocks, like high import taxes to entering and competing in the country’s competitive and fast-growing economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BHN8N"&gt;The Indian government calls its campaign to encourage local investment and growth in India-based enterprises “&lt;a href="https://aatmanirbharbharat.mygov.in/"&gt;Aatmanirbhar Bharat,&lt;/a&gt;” which translates to “self-reliant India” and has become a cornerstone of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policy since its official introduction last year. “We welcome Amazon’s decision to set up a manufacturing line in Chennai, as it will enhance domestic production capacities, and create jobs as well,” said Ravi Shankar Prasad, the country’s minister for communications, electronics, and information, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Djsy6B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tamil Nadu has been an essential partner for Amazon India &amp;amp; we are excited to launch our 1st manufacturing line in Chennai. This contributes directly to the local economy &amp;amp; showcases India’s ability to produce world-class products. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CMOTamilNadu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CMOTamilNadu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Guidance_TN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Guidance_TN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/muruganandamias?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@muruganandamias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Amazon India News (@AmazonNews_IN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonNews_IN/status/1361583332513828866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="12uemG"&gt;According to Amazon, the Chennai line will be capable of producing hundreds of thousands of devices every year, starting with the Fire TV line of streaming devices. The company says it will “continuously evaluate scaling capacity to additional marketplaces/cities depending on the domestic demand.” The announcement comes a year after Amazon said it would begin &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/"&gt;investing as much as $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in local Indian businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RlA0l"&gt;“Amazon is committed to partner with the Indian government to advance the vision of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” said Amit Agarwal, Amazon’s global senior vice president of Amazon India, in a statement. “We have pledged to invest US $1 billion to digitize 10 million small and medium businesses, help Indian businesses sell worldwide thereby enabling US $10B in cumulative exports, and create an additional 1MM jobs by 2025.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDqoga"&gt;Amazon’s heavy investment in India is more evidence of the country’s growing significance as both a prime market for Western consumer electronics and as a manufacturing center that can compete with China and other fast-growing production hubs. It’s also a sign that Modi’s aggressive foreign and economic policymaking is translating to successful infusions of outside investment, as Amazon, it seems, would rather create local jobs and work with established production partners than face potential restrictions on reaching Indian customers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5’s actual silicon processor is revealed in these first gorgeous photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XBr2_Pqc0BBJpNBbu1m1UamtBTE=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68826551/sony_ps5_liquid_metal_fritzchen_fritz_2200.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBIdSM"&gt;While the world continues to wait for a chance to buy the PlayStation 5, we’re continuing to put Sony’s next-gen console under the microscope — literally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;when we showed you the 40,000 tiny PlayStation symbols&lt;/a&gt; hidden in each gamepad, and now somewhat figuratively with what we believe are the first up-close pictures of the PS5’s actual silicon &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FritzchensFritz/status/1360994406434807809/photo/1"&gt;from photographer Fritzchens Fritz&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/sony-playstation-5-soc-die-pictured-up-close"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AmFtM"&gt;Above, you can see one of Fritz’s gorgeous close-ups of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505598/sony-ps5-playstation-5-tear-down-hardware"&gt;the liquid metal interface Sony uses&lt;/a&gt; to keep the PS5’s temperatures in check. Below, find a stunning monochrome portrait of it framed against the motherboard:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsYi3ZADzJRJ6f-26075uUwNRjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307844/sony_ps5_die_shot_fritzchen_fritz_2200.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kAEEZh"&gt;Let’s turn it upright, shall we? Here’s a high-res version you might be able to blow up more easily (just tap it first):&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMQnApggHRd4vvrfl3KYS9sTd7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307879/sony_ps5_die_shot_fritzchen_fritz_vertical.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s2iU7Y"&gt;And here’s what you’re actually seeing, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Locuza_/status/1361026970893627398"&gt;a tentative die shot analysis&lt;/a&gt; that Fritz retweeted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vmAkhL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My interpretation of the floor plan PS5 floor plan:&lt;br&gt;1. Bomba surprise that Sony likely cut down the 256-Bit FP pipes to just 128-Bit. &lt;br&gt;2. No Infinity Cache/L3$, also not on the Xbox Series. &lt;br&gt;3. Might have the old Render Backend design, need higher res to say for sure. &lt;br&gt;4. ... &lt;a href="https://t.co/gwrXI903U8"&gt;https://t.co/gwrXI903U8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Vvmm1hGSM8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Vvmm1hGSM8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Locuza (@Locuza_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Locuza_/status/1361026970893627398?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyee8V"&gt;Here’s where you might be tempted to dive into some technical details — perhaps argue &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ps5-die-shots-reveal-missing-zen-2-rdna-2-features/"&gt;how the PS5’s silicon stacks up&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox counterpart or AMD’s versions for PC — but I’d suggest you resist for now. For one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21718936/xbox-series-x-ps5-performance-game-comparison"&gt;results matter more than specs&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps more importantly, we haven’t finished looking at awesome photos yet! &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An overview shot of the PS5’s die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t9qgng"&gt;And here’s one more, zoomed all the way into the region where AMD’s Zen 2 CPU cores live:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/COu1f6EEUPxbtC-0ptR9fA1-_l0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307916/50947289326_07f4ba7345_o.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="44qtgB"&gt;That’s as far as Fritz has come with the PS5 so far, but if these kinds of photos excite you, I’d definitely recommend spending some time &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/130561288@N04/with/50943598756/"&gt;on Fritz’s Flickr page&lt;/a&gt; where you’ll find an incredible number of vibrant, up-close-and-personal, public domain&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;photos of silicon that leap right off the page. &lt;em&gt;PCGamesN&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd-intel-nvidia-naked-silicon-fritzchens-fritz"&gt;called Fritz&lt;/a&gt; a “silicon pornographer,” and it’s not hard to see why. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku job listing suggests big plans for original movies and TV shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbBDltyoezyxEkc77Rp6W7uHA8k=/203x0:4349x2764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68826225/TRC_UK_Home_Screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dy95Ee"&gt;Roku is looking to create its own original “episodic and feature productions,” according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fjobs%2Fview%2Flead-production-attorney-at-roku-inc-2376352104%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285819%2Froku-original-content-job-listing-plan-original-shows-movies#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent (and now closed) job listing&lt;/a&gt; posted by the company (&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/roku-original-content-push"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The job listing mentions Roku’s “expanding slate of original content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN94VQ"&gt;Roku currently doesn’t have any in-house content of its own. It now owns Quibi’s lineup of shows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;which it acquired from the defunct streaming company&lt;/a&gt;, and it also offers The Roku Channel, an ad-supported service that lets users watch a wide range of TV shows, movies, live news, and more — but we haven’t yet seen any shows that are made by Roku itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPoToihrjrkzX-msqSaaBDsmgtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307574/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_9.29.36_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The job listing that mentions “original episodic and feature length productions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MpyWdV"&gt;The job listing, however, indicates that Roku is looking to get into the content production business — something its hardware competitors like Amazon and Apple have already done. Providing its own shows could give its users a reason to spend more time on their Roku devices, which in turn could help further boost the company’s ad revenue, even if users aren’t watching its shows specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKKh0H"&gt;The company’s potential shows and movies will be competing with a huge catalog of originals from other streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu. But unlike those streaming heavyweights, Roku sells devices that bring all the services together, so while Roku will technically be going head to head with the other companies, its users will also be watching &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;on a Roku box. That convenient customer experience remains important — even if Roku occasionally butts heads with streaming providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fm1krD"&gt;It’s probably worth noting that it may be a while before you’ll get to actually see a Roku show. If the company is just now hiring production attorneys, the process is likely still in pretty early stages. However, it goes to show how much value Roku sees in bringing original content to the table. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disaster scammers target Texas blackout victims</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Winter Storm Uri Brings Ice And Snow Across Widespread Parts Of The Nation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsM8UtgNUdOfvN8tRBlwdjbVI4s=/0x0:5595x3730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68826133/1231190479.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Montinique Monroe/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rbmion"&gt;A freezing winter storm passed through Texas and parts of the Midwest over the weekend, straining parts of the state’s electricity grid to the point of blackouts. But with many Texans struggling to heat their homes, disaster scammers have reportedly been taking advantage of the disaster to try to steal account info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrGUOq"&gt;In a tweet on Tuesday, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, warned followers that social media scammers were posing as electricity workers and asking people to text them their private account numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIx3Bs"&gt;“Don’t do it!” the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO/status/1361712314911772683?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t need any of your info to get your power back on — we are working as fast as we possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RQWJ4C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There is a scam circulating on social media asking customers to text their private account numbers. Don’t do it! We don’t need any of your info to get your power back on – we are working as fast as we possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;— ERCOT (@ERCOT_ISO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO/status/1361712314911772683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TScs9t"&gt;Generally, it’s a bad idea to hand over private information — from account numbers to passwords — over the phone or through text message. Scammers oftentimes make big promises for pieces of information like “how much money you make, how much you owe, or your bank account, credit card, or Social Security number,” &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-report-spam-text-messages"&gt;according to The Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;. These promises could be anything from getting your electricity turned back on to winning an Amazon gift card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO5HQ9"&gt;Disaster scams like these aren’t unusual. After natural disasters, FEMA has warned survivors not to offer personal or financial information over the phone if the person on the other line does not adequately identify themselves as a government employee. Scammers often pose as FEMA or other government employees during disaster situations like this week’s winter storm in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a66XVh"&gt;In order to protect yourself from text, phone, or email scammers, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/after-storms-watch-out-scams"&gt;the Federal Communications Commission asks&lt;/a&gt; that if an insurance, electric, or government employee calls you asking for money, to hang up on them. Then, call the company on your own before handing over any personal or financial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh9Ufe"&gt;The FCC also asks that survivors verify information in social media posts before making a donation to an organization or on a crowdfunding website like GoFundMe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzNv6B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="dMhgME"&gt;Microsoft is updating its Edge browser with a Kids Mode that should make browsing safer and more customizable, in a kid-friendly way. The feature is not widely available, but it’s being rolled out to Edge Insiders in Microsoft’s Canary test channel, with the feature coming to the dev channel soon after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiINnk"&gt;Kids Mode can be enabled by selecting it from the Profile picker in Microsoft Edge, not dissimilar from using a similar Kids profile in a streaming service. Browsing in Kids Mode enables several features. Kids Mode comes with custom browser themes, Bing SafeSearch enabled to keep kids away from “adult” search results, and an allow list that parents can use to set appropriate websites. The allow list comes predefined in Edge, according to Microsoft, but parents can edit the list of approved content from the “Family” section of the browser’s settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9TPyn"&gt;Kids modes are common features on streaming services and devices, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3436764/netflix-just-for-kids-ipad-app"&gt;Netflix’s Just for Kids&lt;/a&gt; profile and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/hd-home/2014/6/19/5818982/amazon-launches-freetime-for-kids-on-fire-tv"&gt;Amazon’s FreeTime service&lt;/a&gt; that it includes on Fire Tablets and Fire TV sticks. Having some kid-focused settings you can turn on easily saves the hassle of getting granular by picking and choosing what your kid can experience. Adding it to a browser makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s troubled MMO New World pushed back to August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEWI_dT-Pbjugh3zyPAcuF91veo=/91x0:961x580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825853/corrupted_porta_1080x580.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLCJJz"&gt;Amazon’s open-world MMO, &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, has once again been delayed. The developer now expects the game to launch August 31st. “We’ve been hard at work on compelling end-game features we believe are important to include at launch,” an update on the &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/new-world-developer-update"&gt;game’s site&lt;/a&gt; reads. “These features won’t be ready for the Spring timeframe that we had communicated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vw8CT"&gt;Development at Amazon has been bumpy. &lt;em&gt;New World &lt;/em&gt;has already had its share of criticism as well for its depictions of European colonization. The tentpole game, previously intended for a launch in 2020, was pushed from its August date to spring 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;last July&lt;/a&gt; — its &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/history-and-magic-collide-in-mmo-new-world-releasing-may-2020/"&gt;second delay&lt;/a&gt;. The news came just days after Amazon-owned studio, Relentless, essentially un-launched its free-to-play shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; by putting it back into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;closed beta&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18681082/amazon-gaming-studio-layoff-dozens-of-developers"&gt;laid off dozens&lt;/a&gt; of developers as part of a reorganization; it canceled another tentpole game, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17187836/amazon-game-studios-breakaway-status-canceled"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breakaway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ug5lkG"&gt;In the post today, &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;’s developer said that “with this extra time we’ll be able to add these substantial improvements while polishing and fine tuning the whole game before we open Aeternum’s shores to the world.” The developer plans to continue its alpha testing and expand to European servers on March 20th. A closed beta is planned for July 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lybAm5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Finicky COVID-19 vaccines raise the stakes of power outages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izYuhAEq4caEl37cZ-zdQ5-eb2M=/0x3:6937x4628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825577/1230987861.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mark Felix / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RgXyQr"&gt;Winter storms paralyzing the United States have left &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/16/968230163/millions-without-power-in-texas-northern-mexico-as-blackouts-and-bitter-cold-con?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;millions without power&lt;/a&gt; and sent health officials scrambling to protect freezers full of COVID-19 vaccines, which have to be kept at extremely low temperatures or risk going bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHFuDj"&gt;Rolling blackouts through Texas took out at least &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-officials-scramble-administer-8000-covid-vaccines-power/story?id=75911159"&gt;one set of freezers&lt;/a&gt; full of the Moderna vaccine; 5,000 doses were sent to a university, a jail, and a handful of hospitals before they expired. The &lt;a href="https://www.kptv.com/news/winter-storm-causes-power-outages-to-freezers-protecting-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-oregon/article_95cc2336-7000-11eb-bb34-7362ce54e5e9.html"&gt;Oregon Health Authority&lt;/a&gt; is moving vaccines to places with power, although the agency isn’t disclosing which storage sites have their systems down. As part of its storm preparations, Kentucky made sure places holding COVID-19 vaccines had contingency plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6WVUG"&gt;“For each provider they have a generator on site that is ready to go on, or they have a partner who…can immediately pack it up and provide it,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear &lt;a href="https://www.wkyufm.org/post/kentucky-officials-warn-icy-roadways-power-outages-due-winter-storm#stream/0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a press briefing last week. “That should make sure that no doses and no vials are wasted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nmXxE"&gt;Power outages are challenging for hospitals and health care facilities at the best of times. The health care system is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;reliant on a steady supply of power&lt;/a&gt; to keep people healthy. Facilities need electricity for lights, electronic health records, ventilators, and refrigerators full of medications. Many people with illnesses rely on power in their homes for things like &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/02/16/winter-storm-live-updates/"&gt;oxygen tanks&lt;/a&gt;. During outages, they also can’t heat or cool their homes to counteract extreme temperatures, which can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3Wri5"&gt;Hospitals are required to have backup generators, but outpatient and community clinics don’t face the same regulations. And generators sometimes fail — the downed freezers in Texas were supposed to be powered by a backup that ended up not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9DZOU"&gt;“We’re so used to having an uninterrupted supply of power,” Grete Porteous, an anesthesiologist and emergency medicine specialist at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. “It really blows people’s minds to understand that all of this is very fragile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuf86f"&gt;A public health emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic amplifies the risks of power outages. Hospitals, public health departments, and other health care facilities are already stretched thin. Many doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932780/california-blackout-healthcare-electricity-fires"&gt;aren’t used&lt;/a&gt; to treating patients with limited power and may have to navigate it on the fly when they’re already strapped for resources. Shelters for people without power, like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/north-texas-cities-open-warming-centers-as-millions-of-texans-face-bitterly-cold-night-without-electricity/2552659/"&gt;warming centers&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, could risk spreading COVID-19 even though they’re critical to keep people from freezing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkJndS"&gt;And any facility storing COVID-19 vaccines has to devote attention to the freezers keeping them safe in addition to managing power to their health records or their oxygen supply. Doses are still limited, and any vial lost because it warmed up too quickly means fewer people can be protected from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOi5eF"&gt;The stakes of a power outage for health care are always high. But when the system is already unstable and run ragged by one emergency, a second stressor compounds the pressure to keep the lights on and the freezers running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92tVvS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Digital lock (Shutterstock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BS_5Dr3dKivxmRjDEq73BeXLB-g=/0x42:1000x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825516/shutterstock_71973916.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nSqJyn"&gt;Free is always nice, and when a free app is no longer free (or when the free version becomes so limited it is virtually useless), then you have to decide whether to pay up or move on. This happened with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12052056/evernote-price-changes-basic-plus-premium"&gt;Evernote note manager almost five years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and now it is time for users of the popular password manager LastPass to make the same decision. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;LastPass is changing its free version&lt;/a&gt; so that it will only work on one type of device — either your computer or your mobile device. If you, like most of us, use both a phone and a computer, then you will have to either start paying $3 a month or find an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldLQTp"&gt;If you’d rather not pay at all, there are other password managers out there that have free versions that may work better for you. And there are, of course, other alternatives. Most browsers, such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox, have their own password managers. In addition, many security apps such as Norton offer their own password managers, so if you already subscribe to one, you may have a password manager on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JolJwE"&gt;But if you’d rather use an independent password manager, here are a few that are currently available. We have not yet tried them out; this is just a brief look until we have a chance to make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ob1s0TSFmQrEx0mlBW64_mR8GdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307300/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.37.38_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bitwarden&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DicWdP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="szKm7f"&gt;Bitwarden is a well-known open-source password manager that offers a solid selection of features, including saving unlimited items, syncing across devices, and generating passwords. For day-to-day password usage, Bitwarden could be a good alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVgn0J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/pricing/business/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For $10 a year, you can add 1GB of encrypted file storage and two-step login, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/te5Nptg-a0LIJ9LVkmym530PCqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307342/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qsy1lR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/vault/"&gt;Zoho Vault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kv4R6W"&gt;Zoho Vault, which is one of Zoho’s wide variety of productivity apps, has a free version that includes unlimited storage of passwords and notes, access from both computers and mobile devices, two-factor authentication, and password generation, among a fairly impressive number of other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujKtRU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/vault/pricing.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Zoho’s paid plan, which starts at $1 / month per user, offers business options such as password sharing and expiration alerts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/79ticNbeYjoSPQU_vRP-TrMbR0o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307349/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.45.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: KeePass&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WCuwuc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://keepass.info/"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qWG0v7"&gt;KeePass is another free open-source password manager, but judging from its website, it may be a little difficult for less technically adept users to adopt. Nothing is kept in the cloud, so while that can be more secure (you can store your passwords in a master key-locked encrypted database), it is also less convenient. However, if you don’t mind manually transferring your password database from one device to another, this could be worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhiT5U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other pricing: &lt;/strong&gt;None&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7QRcxL"&gt;LogMeOnce’s free version provides unlimited passwords and use on unlimited devices, along with autofill, sync, password generation, and two-factor authentication. LogMeOnce uses ads to fund its free version, so that could be a setback, depending on your tolerance for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="g7YQ7t"&gt;NordPass has a free version that includes unlimited passwords and syncing across devices. While there is no limit on the number of devices you can use, only one can be active at a time — so, for example, if you use it on your phone, you will be logged out of your computer’s version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="DIZgox"&gt;RoboForm has been around for a while, although it’s never been as well-known as LastPass or 1Password. Its free version offers unlimited passwords, form filling, and emergency access, among other features. However, it does not sync across devices, which can be a definite inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IBM sets new climate goal for 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside IBM Research Headquarters" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WwvwpJ9Y34PbcWag0mfK3Q5VxMA=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68825452/468943455.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Inside IBM Research Headquarters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQwMfU"&gt;IBM plans to get rid of its planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions from its operations by 2030, the company announced today. And unlike some other tech companies that have made splashy environmental commitments lately, IBM’s pledge emphasized the need to prevent emissions rather than developing ways to capture carbon dioxide after it’s released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xSBODp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;IBM is pledging to do “all it can across its operations” to stop polluting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jAujnj"&gt;The company committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this decade, pledging to do “all it can across its operations” to stop polluting before it turns to emerging technologies that might be able to capture carbon dioxide after it’s emitted. It plans to rely on renewable energy for 90 percent of its electricity use by 2030. By 2025, it wants to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent compared to 2010 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSxFgk"&gt;“I am proud that IBM is leading the way by taking actions to significantly reduce emissions,” said IBM chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-commits-to-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030-301228742.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Hx8f"&gt;IBM is putting more emphasis on its cloud computing and AI after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508974/ibm-split-into-two-companies-newco-hybrid-cloud-legacy-it"&gt;announcing in October&lt;/a&gt; that it would split into two public companies and house its legacy IT services under a new name. That pivot puts IBM in more direct competition with giants like Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud market, which is notorious for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41558-020-0837-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F16%2F22285669%2Fibm-climate-change-commitment-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guzzling up energy&lt;/a&gt;. Data centers accounted for about 1 percent of global electricity use in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/data-centres-and-energy-from-global-headlines-to-local-headaches"&gt;according to the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and can strain local power grids. All three companies have now made big pledges to rein in pollution that drives climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpGDLw"&gt;Microsoft’s climate pledge focuses on driving the development of technologies that suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere; it reached net zero emissions in 2012 but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;still relies heavily on investing in forests&lt;/a&gt; to offset its carbon pollution. Amazon committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2040. Amazon’s emissions, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continue to grow&lt;/a&gt; as its business expands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="zRghpC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is still room for more ambition in IBM’s new climate commitment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pgPgWZ"&gt;There is still room for more ambition in IBM’s new climate commitment since the company so far is not setting targets for reducing emissions coming from its supply chain or the use of its products by consumers. These kinds of indirect emissions often make up a majority of a company’s carbon footprint. IBM does not track all of the pollution from its supply chain, but other indirect emissions (like those from the products it sells) made up the biggest chunk of its carbon footprint &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/climate/ghg.shtml"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront.net/a4/ad/b9eca67e4578b35e8f995c8b4f9c/amazon-carbon-methodology-september-2019.pdf"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, consider all of these sources of emissions in their climate pledges. &lt;/p&gt;
